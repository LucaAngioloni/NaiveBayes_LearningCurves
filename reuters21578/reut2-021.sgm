<TITLE>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
of one thousand cuts."
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it
accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.
    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the
11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead
of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.
    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White told
reporters.
    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike," he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.
    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike
would be avoided.
    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved
we're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.
    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," he
said.
    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the
weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.
    White said the union has also received assurances that a
job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does
not threaten Canadian jobs.
    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches
agreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct
immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.

<TITLE>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
"crushing blow."
    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    "It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait."
    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep."
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody."
    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."

<TITLE>LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
    "We consider this matter closed," he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Treasury confirmed that the
sale of British Petroleum Co Plc will go ahead as planned,
despite Monday's stock market crash which forced BP below the

    "The government are not considering terminating the BP
offer. The offer has been fully underwritten," a Treasury
spokesman said.
    The issue, which remains open until October 28, was fully
underwritten last week when the issue price was set.
    BP shares closed down 33p at 317p as the FT-SE 100 share
index crashed a record 249.6 points, more than 10 pct.

    Angelo Mozilo, vice chairman and executive vice president,
also told security analysts that that company should have a
total loan servicing portfolio of 11 billion or 12 billion dlrs
by the end of the current fiscal year, in February 1988.
    Countrywide Credit, a financial service company primarily
involved in mortgage banking, reported 4.5 billion dlrs in its
loan servicing portfolio for the last fiscal year.
    In addition, Mozilo said the company was continuing to
reduce expenses by one mln dlrs a month and should bring total
costs down by three mln dlrs at the end of the quarter.
    He said about 55 pct of the cost cuts were in personnel,
and that the company had reduced the number of its offices
nationwide by 11 in recent months.

VENEZUELA SAYS OPEC OIL OUTPUT 0VER 18 MLN BPD CARACAS, Oct 19
- The current OPEC oil production is above 18 mln barrels per
day (bpd) and this level threatens the precarious equilibrium
of the of oil market, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters three or four countries out of OPEC's 13
members were mainly responsible for the overproduction, but
declined to identify them.
     OPEC's production ceiling for the second half of 1987 is
16.6 mln bpd. The Venezuelan minister said OPEC's production
reached a peak this year when it went over 19 mln bpd in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti, together with the oil ministers of
Nigeria and Indonesia, met the heads of state of six Mideast
Gulf countries earlier this month to urge OPEC members to
comply with assigned production quotas.
    He said some of the countries which were complying as
Venezuela, Indonesia, Libya, Algeria, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and
Iran.
    Hernandez declined to say whether the three or four
countries he said were overproducing bordered the Mideast Gulf.

<TITLE>NORTHEAST SAVINGS &lt;NSB> ADOPTS RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARTFORD, Conn., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northeast Savings F.A. said its
board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
sharholders.
    Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
record as of November two, the company said.
    Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
    However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
said.
    The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
dlrs a share, the company said.
    The company said that in the event of certain triggering
events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
Northeast enters into certain business combination
transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
certain events.

<TITLE>U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. is drafting options including
possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
Buenos Aires levies on exports.
    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
competition with the U.S.
    "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
(Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.
   
    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
end the differential.
    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering
restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef
and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.
    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan
administration soon, they said.

<TITLE>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PLANS U.S. DOMESTIC BOND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The African Development Bank plans to
raise about 200 mln dlrs via a U.S. Domestic bond this year,
Milan Kerno, vice president of finance said at a presentation.
    He said the Bank planned to borrow about 700 mln dlrs in
world capital markets in 1987 and roughly the same amount in
1988. Because of the weak condition of the euroyen market,
plans for a bond in that sector, which would comprise part of
the 700 mln dlrs,  have been put on hold, Kerno said.
    "But we should complete our programme (this year), markets
willing," Kerno said, adding the Bank's 1987 borrowing so far
totaled about 400 mln dlrs.
    The Bank's board of directors will meet on October 26 to
discuss plans to begin Bank trading in unspecified securities,
with desks in Abidjan, Kerno said.
    Trading would be conducted along similar lines as existing
World Bank and Asian Development Bank operations, he said.
    The Bank now has roughly 1.2 billion dlrs in available
liquidity to serve as a basis for trading, although not all of
this will be traded at the start. The Bank plans to use the
funds gradually over the next three or four years, he said.
    To facilitate lending increases the Bank tripled paid-in
capital to about 18 billion dlrs from six billion in June.
    German bankers at the presentation criticized the Bank for
its overly conservative lending, adding the Bank would do
better to invest more capital in loans. Total net equity
capital, consisting of subscribed capital and reserves, rose to
1,282 pct of its funded debt in 1986 from 552 pct in 1985, the
Bank's statistics showed.
    Other Bank figures from 1986 showed the Interamerican
Development Bank's net equity totaled 302 pct of funded debt,
and the Asian Development Bank's 295 pct.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French finance minister Edouard Balladur
said the agenda of state privatisations may not be done at full
speed if market conditions prove unsuitable.
    "I'm not going to privatise at full speed if market
conditions do not permit. That would be absurd," he told
journalists. "What we're going to do is adapt our program very
closely to the evolution of our stock markets."
    French stock prices fell more than 10 pct on Monday, a
6-1/2 year record, as concern deepened that interest rates
worldwide would surge and choke off fragile economic growth,
dealers said. Stock of several privatised firms fell below
their issue price.

    There was no formal comment on the market slide, but an
official suggested that a comment might be forthcoming after
the market closed.
     Reagan made no mention of the stock market when he gave a
glowing account of recent economic performance at the swearing
in of C. William Verity as Commerce Secretary.
    He said this month would set a record for the longest
peacetime expansion on record and added that leading indicators
had sent a message of "steady as she goes."

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA DEBT PAYMENTS TO BE ADJUSTED TO EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslav Prime Minister Branko Mikulic,
unveiling a new draft economic program, said Yugoslavia would
cut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debt
to bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity.
    "We have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt with
realistically assessed capabilities of our economy," he said in
Parliament. He said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pct
of export revenue) was too high.
    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of its
debt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.
    "If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, the
situation would become increasingly worse," Mikulic said.
    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia would
have a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt
would be halved by 1995. But he added:
    "The consequences would not only mean slower economic growth
in the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy
and lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development,"
he said.
    "All that would, of course, intensify social difficulties,"
Mikulic added.
    The state news agency Tanjug said on October 9 that
Yugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eight
years and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.
    Yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due last
month which had already been postponed by 90 days.
    Mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includes
higher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, is
intended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrate
Yugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.
    His program has to be discussed and approved by parliament
by early November.
    Mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about the
same level as now until 1990 and the country should then be
able to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.
    "Of course, these are our proposals for talks with
creditors. We expect understanding and support because it is in
their interest as well," Mikulic said.
    He said that under the present schedule debt payments had
slowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves.
Banking sources say Yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate at
present for even one month's debt and import bill.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Stock Exchange said it is
confident that its computer systems can handle the pace of
trading volume today.
    "We are confident that whatever volume we have this
afternoon, we can handle it," said Richard Torrenzano, a vice
president at the NYSE.
    With two hours of trading left, a record 422 mln shares
have traded hands, far outpacing the volume on the market's
busiet days. The previous busiest day was last Friday, when 338
mln shares traded.
    "Our systems have been tested and they can handle heavy
volume effectiviy and efficiently," Torrenzano said.
    He said the Exchange has been in constant contact with the
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning today's record
breaking decline and heavy volume. He declined to comment on
the context of those discussions.
    Earlier today, SEC chairman David Ruder said a brief
trading halt has been discussed as one way of restoring order
to the market, but stressed he is not recommending one at this
time. He did not say if the option was discussed with the NYSE.

<TITLE>AUSTRIAN GUARANTEE WANTED ON STATE FIRM DEBTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Head of the Chamber of Commerce's Money
and Credit section, Hellmuth Klauhs, said the government should
guarantee any company debts arising from the planned
restructuring of the public sector.
    Klauhs said that there was no doubt that the government
would meet its obligations. "But the owner should say this
clearly once again," he added.
    Klauhs said 35 billion of 61 billion schillings owed by
firms under the state holding &lt;Oesterreichische
Industrieholding AG> (OIAG) currently had no formal state
guarantee. Nine of the 35 billion schillings were owed to
foreign banks.
    Klauhs, also managing director of &lt;Genossenschaftliche
Zentralbank AG>, said banking industry officials would discuss
the issue with finance minister Ferdinand Lacina next month.
    Lacina said last week a special guarantee would be
unnecessary, as state industry had the financial power and
enough liquidity to pay its debts.
    The government has said the latest injection of state funds
into OIAG to cover losses will be the last.
    Under a restructuring plan, OIAG is to create five new
holding companies divided by sector.

<TITLE>SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent announcements from Moscow of
next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
Agriculture Department analysts said.
    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."
    "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.
   
    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian Jones</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a
responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries should
respect pledges on monetary policy made in the February Louvre
accord on currency stability.
    "We have to strengthen the cooperation between the seven
major industrial countries and remind ourselves of the pledges
we made at the Louvre," he told journalists.
    "They were not simply pledges to maintain currency
stability, but also to conduct a certain type of economic and
monetary policy," he added.
    Balladur's comments came after U.S. Treasury Secretary
James Baker said on Sunday that the U.S. Would have to
re-examine the Louvre accords in the light of the rise in West
German short-term interest rates.
    Balladur was one of the main architects of the Louvre
accord and has invested considerable political capital in
defending them.

<TITLE>CATERPILLAR &lt;CAT> SEES HIGHER FISCAL 1987 NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEORIA, Ill, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caterpillar Inc said it expects 1987
full year sales and profits to be "substantially better" than
1986 results, following improved third-quarter performance.
    Third-quarter earnings of the heavy machinery manufacturer
increased to 146 mln dlrs, or 1.47 dlrs a share, from net loss
of 26 mln dlrs, or 26 cts, in the 1986 quarter. Sales rose to
2.25 billion dlrs from 1.82 billion dlrs last year.
    A weaker U.S. dollar strengthened Caterpillar's position
against foreign manufacturers and permitted price increases and
boosted sales, while a cost-cutting program lowered costs
significantly, the company said of third-quarter results.
   
    Continuation of the cost-reduction program, which is to
pare costs by 15 to 20 pct from 1986 to 1990, and a further
anticipated improvement in its price competitiveness are
expected to contribute to higher full year 1987 profits,
Caterpillar said.
    In 1986, the company earned 76 mln dlrs or 77 cents a
share.

<TITLE>LSI LOGIC &lt;LLSI.O> DEVELOPS NEW COMPUTER CHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>LSI Logic Corp said it has
developed a semi-custom microchip that is twice as dense as the
most complex chip now available.
    The new microchip, LCA 100K Compacted Array Plus, has
100,000 usable gate arrays, or the equivalent of 400,000
transistors for designing custom chips, the company said.
    Production of the new chip will begin in about 15 months,
said LSI Chairman Wilfred Corrigan.
    The microchip can be used in products including computers,
telecommunications and military equipment, allowing them to
operate faster with improved reliability, the company said.
    "This technology will pave the way for new uses in
artificial intelligence, speech recognition and speech
synthesis, as well as digital signal processing and image
processing," Corrigan said. He also predicted the microchip
will add about five pct to the company's revenues next year.
    Analyst Millard Phelps of Hambrecht and Quist Inc said he
expects LSI to finish its 1987 fiscal year with per share
earnings of 24 cts, on sales of 252 mln dlrs. He put 1988
earnings at 60 cts per share on 330 mln dlrs in sales.
   In the nine months ended Sept 27, LSI had earnings of 14 cts
per share, or 5,560,000 dlrs, on 183.9 mln dlrs in sales.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran said several people were injured in
Monday's U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed
retaliation, Tehran radio reported.
    It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, "We will
definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move
unanswered."
    A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian
personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of
Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this
afternoon. It described damage as "severe."
    Washington said four American frigates shelled and
destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly
Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's
missile attack on a U.S.-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters.
    The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military
pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs
earlier this month.
    Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or
personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value.
    "With this move Mr. Reagan has committed a big mistake and
has definitely increased his problems...

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON WARNS AGAINST LOWER DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" to
persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange
conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
exacerbate financial market conditions.
    "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
and lead to further potential for financial problems."
    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.
businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting
despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
past two years.
    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
begin showing improvement.
    "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive
expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SWISS PLAN CHANGE IN LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss Banking Commission hopes to
introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which
would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual
liquidity requirements.
    Commission Director Kurt Hauri told Reuters the main
consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in
interest rates which occurs at the end of every month.
    By effectively reducing liquidity requirements, it would
also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain,
West Germany and the United States, he said.
    The commission wants to move to a system of average
liquidity requirements, where banks have to hold reserves
equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated
over the month as a whole.
    The current system, described  as a Swiss special case by
Hauri, forces banks to comply with requirements generally only
at the end of each month.
    The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money
market rates, overshadowed by the approach of the end-month,
called the ultimo, with consequent high costs for the banks who
are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank.
    This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when
overnight rates hit triple figures, due to a combination of the
half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its
money supply target. Although the rise shocked the bank into
more flexibility, the problem remained.
    The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned for
years, was given to banks and other interested parties for
comment on September 30.
    They have until the end of this month to suggest
alterations. Subject to such changes, and to the government
go-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said.

<TITLE>NORTHROP MUST PAY KHASHOGGI FIRM - U.S. COURT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court let stand a ruling
that Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a company
controlled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.
    The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.
arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs in
commissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it won
from Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.
    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft and
supporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in
1970 as its marketing representative.
    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions to
Khashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to
1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'
sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billion
dlrs.
    The legal battle dates back to 1979, when Khashoggi began
arbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mln
dlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop.
    A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel's
award of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm, but a U.S. Court of
Appeals reinstated it last March.

<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) will not
issue a joint statement on the U.S. Attack on Iran for now,
diplomats said.
    They said the latest events in the Gulf were discussed only
briefly by foreign ministers over lunch, though member states
had been informed by Washington that it was planning military
action. "They didn't have enough information to discuss it fully
and they wouldn't have agreed anyway," one diplomat said.
    Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans said Belgium had
always opposed an extension of violence in the Gulf and deeply
regretted that the situation had deteriorated.
    But British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the
United States was fully entitled to take military action and
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said the U.S. Strike could
be considered an af self-defence.

<TITLE>SEIDMAN WORRIED ABOUT U.S. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman
William Seidman said he is worried that consumer confidence
will be undermined by panic selling of stocks.
    "The principal worry is that the market will panic and
destroy the really strong confidence that the consumer has in
the economy," Seidman told reporters during the American
Bankers Association annual convention.
    But Seidman was relaxed about the implications for banks.
"I don't see any near-term effect on the banking system. We
would have to worry if it throws the economy into a major
recession. We don't expect that to happen." he said.
    First Chicago Corp chairman Barry Sullivan echoed Seidman,
saying that the slump in stocks could hasten a recession "if it
significantly impacts consumer confidence."
    But Sullivan told reporters that he thinks the U.S. economy
remains sound.
    Sullivan said the slide in stocks was an extreme reaction
to recent increases in interest rates.
    Asked whether First Chicago would follow Chemical Bank in
raising its prime rate to 9-3/4 pct from 9-1/4, Sullivan said,
"We're looking very carefully at the money markets."
    The FDIC's Seidman, asked whether the stock market rout was
a reason to reconsider plans to give broader securities powers
to commercial s, said, "Under the plan we are suggesting
that (securities) activities be done in subsidiaries so if ever
things go badly for them it won't affect their capital."

    Treasury Secretary James Baker and other administration

<DATELINE>    MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allied-Signal Inc said

year earlier, which was restated to exclude sales and expenses

billion dlrs from 1.099 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    After-tax income from its automotive division rose to 28
mln dlrs from 26 mln dlrs. In its engineered materials
division, after-tax income rose to 52 mln dlrs from 39 mln
dlrs.

than 100 shares. As of Octotber 16, company said it had reduced
the number of shares outstanding to 164.6 mln.

<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.N. Security Council was
called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations 
following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform.
    Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a
report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans.
    In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was
being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N.
Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right
of self-defense.
    The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de
Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to
Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but
was trying to find out "what actually happened."
    Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response.

main home markets, Switzerland, West Germany and Sweden, would
continue to play an important role, Asea said in a statement.
    It said research and development were crucial to the
group's future and central reasearch resources and laboratories
in the three home markets would be strengthened.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baring Capital Investors Ltd (BCI), a unit
of the U.K. Merchant bank &lt;Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>, said it
has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be
invested in management buy-outs and development capital
opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.
    The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the
Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine
European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs
soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.
    BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise
buy-out and development capital investors.
    BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based
unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company
owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.
    Individual investments are expected to range between one
and 10 mln ECUs and are likely to be concentrated in the U.K.,
Germany and France.
    BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies,
principally family companies with succession-issues and
corporate spin-offs.

<TITLE>G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>International monetary officials will 
rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
economists and currency traders said.
    "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"
said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
   
    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
tailspin.
    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about
1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one
stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

<DATELINE>    EDISON, N.J., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crazy Eddie Inc said its board will
not oppose the slate of nominees proposed for election to the
board by the committee led by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;EM>
and the &lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, LP.>
    Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
The board also said it will ask representatives of the
Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
promptly as possible.
   
    To that end, the committee's representatives will be
invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
    The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
personnel.
    A further release from the company will follow, it said.

<TITLE>IRAN SAYS US ATTACK INVOLVES IT IN FULL-SCALE WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A top Iranian military official said
America's attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had
involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would
avenge it with a "crushing blow."
    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely," the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the
head of Iran's war information headquarters as saying.
    The official, Kamal Kharrazi, said Washington had now
become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran.
    It was the first official Iranian reaction to the attack by
four U.S. Navy destroyers on the Reshadat oil platform.

<TITLE>PERIPHERAL &lt;PSIX.O> COMPLETES BATTERY TESTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PORTLAND, Ore.,  Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peripheral Systems Inc said it
completed tests of the Nucell-50 radio isotope generating
system, known as a resonant nuclear battery, designed to
produce up to 50 kilowatts of AC electricity.
    The Nucell-50, developed by privately-held &lt;Nucell Inc>,
converts the natural decay of radioactive materials directly
into electricity whout a nuclear reaction or fission process,
the company said.
    Peripheral said it entered into a previously announced
agreement to acquire Nucell, subject to shareholder approval,
and has been providing research funds and engineering to it.
    The merger calls for an unspecified amount of stock to be
paid for Nucell, the company said.
    The Nucell-50 unit, which measures 12 inches by 15 inches
and weighs less than 50 pounds, can operate continuously for
many years, the company said.
    The device uses a small amount of radioactive material,
which can be shielded for consumer use, the company said.
    Initial funding of the Nucell research and development was
provided by individuals, many of whom were officers and
directors of Peripheral, the company said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Agriculture Committee was
expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn
stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

HRI products.
    The company said that under the definitive agreement,
Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51
pct of the new company in the open market, in private
transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing
warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company.
    If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership
within one year after the completion of the merger, the
subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request
that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the
company said.
    Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S.
subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said.
    The transaction is subject to the approval of both
company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals,
and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert
Halmi Jr, the company said.
    Robert Halmi Sr, who is currently chairman and chief
executive officer of Robert Halmi Inc, will be chairman of the
new company and David Evans, current president and chief
operating officer of Hal Roach, will become chief executive,
the company said.

<DATELINE>    TAMPA, Fla., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anchor Glass Container Corp said it
expects fourth quarter profits to exceed the 4.7 mln dlrs
reported for the third quarter and net income for the full year
will be about equal to or slightly exceed 1986's profit before
extraordinary items of 20.6 mln dlrs.
    For the first nine months, Anchor reported operating
profits of 16.2 mln dlrs, down from 17.8 mln dlrs in 1986.
    It said third quarter profits, which dropped from 8.3 mln
dlrs a year earlier, "were on target with management's earlier
expectations".
    The company had previously said it expected the August 13
purchase of Diamond-Bathurst Inc to reduce third quarter
earnings.
    It said third quarter earnings were also reduced by about
800,000 dlrs, or six cents a share, by a year-to-date revision
in the estimated annual effective tax rate as a result of the
acquisition.

<TITLE>MONSANTO &lt;MTC> NUTRASWEET SALES SHOW SMALL DROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Co said sales of its
Nutrasweet artificial sweetener fell slightly in the third
quarter due to a continuing decline in usage by the powdered
soft drink market.
    "It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvement
in the powdered soft drink sector," said Donna Smith, a
Monsanto spokeswoman.
    The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billion
dlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to
177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.
    A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which use
Nutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chief
economist Nick Filippello.
    Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippello
said, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated soft
drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end,
up from 25 pct in 1986.
    That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet in
such items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pct
increase in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987,
Filippello said.
    Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on the
company's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.
    However, Filippello said it was fair to assume that
Monsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet soda
market.
    Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarter
of 1986 when medical studies raised questions about its
possible side effects, such as migraine headaches.
    Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle and Co, Nutrasweet's maker in
1986.

<TITLE>TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Guy Collins</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on."
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord."
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

    In addition to the possible bid for control, the group said
it may purchase additional Media General shares or possibly
seek one or more seats on the company's board of directors
through a proxy contest.
    A bid for control of Media General would be subject to "a
recapitalization or possible restructuring and to possible
changes in the charter documents and by-laws of the company,"
it said.
    The group said it had held discussions with third parties
to gauge their interest in joining the shareholder group, but
no agreements were reached.
    Talks with third parties are expected to continue, the
shareholder group said.
    Between October 13 and 16, Barris Industries bought
1,322,200 shares of Media General Class A common stock 42.50
dlrs to 45.50 dlrs a share in open market transactions, and
another 12,000 shares privately.

<TITLE>SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mining group Boliden AB said it had
agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
operation and would have no control over the product itself.
    He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
northern Sweden.
    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
presence in Saudi Arabia.
    "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar
already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the
future," he said.
    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab
in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi
Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to
open in modern times.
    "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining
technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell
Nilsson.

<TITLE>WANG &lt;WAN> ANNOUNCES FOUR COMPUTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wang Laboratories Inc announced four
additions to its VS line of minicomputers which it said will
offer double the capacity of the older models they replace.
    Company officials told a news conference that Wang will
also announce new entry level and high end computers within the
next 12 months and a family of powerful work stations by the
end of this year.
    Ian Diery, Wang's senior vice president of U.S. operations,
said the new models are lower priced than comparable computers
from Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC>, the world's largest maker of
minicomputers.
   
    Minicomputers are medium sized machines usually used within
a department or work group of a larger company and typically
cost between 10,000 and 500,000 dlrs.
    The VS 5E will replace Wang's entry level VS 5. Priced at
13,000 dlrs, it can support up to 16 users, double the eight
supported by the five and has three times the disc capacity of
the older system.
    The VS 6E can support up to 32 users, double the capacity
of the model six it replaces, and has three times the storage
capacity of the older model. The 6E is priced at 22,000 dlrs.
   
    The VS 75E, which replaces the 65, can support 64 users, 60
pct more than the older model and has twice the main memory
capacity. It is priced at 44,000 dlrs.
    The new VS 7010, which acts as an entry level system for
Wang's more powerful 7000 family of minicomputers, can support
between 30 and 55 users. It is priced at 75,000 dlrs.
    All the new systems are now available, Diery said.
    Bob Ano, Wang's senior vice president of corporate
marketing, said that before the end of the company's fiscal
year on June 30 it will introduce an entry level computer that
will have four times the power of the 5E introduced today.
   
    Within the next 12 to 18 months, he said, Wang will
announce a more powerful high-end machine that will offer
double the price/performance of its 7000 series.
    Ano said the new family of work stations planned for this
year will have a 32-bit semiconductor and be able to support
the industry standard MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems.

<TITLE>SEC HEAD NOT URGING U.S. TRADING HALT AT PRESENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman David Ruder said a brief trading halt has been
discussed as one way of restoring order to the stock market,
but stressed he is not recommending one at present.
    Speaking to reporters, Ruder said he has been in frequent
contact with New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan about
the market's record drop today.
    "I'm not afraid to say that there is some point, and I
don't know what that point is, that I would be quite anxious to
talk to the New York Stock Exchange about a very temporary halt
in trading," Ruder said.
    Ruder, who spoke to reporters after addressing an American
Stock Exchange-sponsored investors' conference here, said that
the SEC does not have the legal authority to order a trading
halt.
    Any trading halt, which would probably last no more than a
half-hour, would have to be approved by the stock exchanges,
Ruder said.

<DATELINE>    COLUMBIA, Md., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Igene Biotechnology Inc said it
terminated its license agreement with Hercules Inc &lt;HPC> for
the manufacture of Igene's natural food preservative and mold
inhibitor.
    It said the cancellation agreed to by both companies.
    Igene said its Weyco-Serv product was licensed to Hercules
in September 1985.
    Under the terms of the agreement, Igene regains all rights,
title and interest in its proprietary microorganisms, process
and product and will repay out of future products sales certain
royalties.
   
    The cancellation of the contract allows Igene to proceed
with plans to produce NaturServ, a modified version of
Weyco-Serv, the company said. The new product is expected to be
available early next year, Igene said.
    The company also said it plans to build a new multiproduct
fermentation plant to meet anticipated demand for NaturServ and
other company natural products.
    Both Weyco-Serv and NaturServ contain high concentrations
of acid salts that naturally inhibit spoilage and molding, the
company said.

<TITLE>UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
Reuter inquiry
    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
hurricane which blocked roads.
    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
spokesman said.
    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
campaign.
    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
severely restricted beet lifting.
    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
available.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wang Laboratories Inc expects revenues for
the year ending June 30, 1988, to increase 12 to 15 pct over
fiscal 1987 to 3.2 billion dlrs, President Frederick Wang said.
    He told a news conference after-tax profit for the year
should increase by three to five pct.
    Earlier Wang said first quarter revenues increased 16 to
693 mln dlrs and profits totaled 22.5 mln dlrs, or 14 cts a
share, vs a loss of 30 mln dlrs, or 19 cts a share, in the
September quarter last year.
   
    Wang told the news conference the company's orders were
particularly strong for the high end of its line of VS
minicomputers.
    "For the past six months the high end really surged" while
the company's entry level computers dipped slightly, senior
vice president of U.S. operations Ian Diery said.
    For the past six months, earnings for both large and entry
level systems in the U.S. increased by 20 pct, he said..
    Wang said the company has seen an overall resurgance in its
business in the U.S. He said the company's business in Europe
"remains fairly firm."

<TITLE>MULTIFOODS &lt;IMC> FILES SUIT AGAINST BREGMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Multifoods Corp
said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
company.
    In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
Belzberg families of Canada.
    The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
    Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined.
    In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
reportedly owns, the suit said.
    According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
benefits of the company's restructuring.
    In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

<TITLE>SALOMON NOT PULLING OUT OF EUROYEN BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Salomon Brothers Inc> is not withdrawing
as a market maker in euroyen bonds, contrary to strong market
rumours circulating in London, a London-based spokeswoman for
the company's New York headquarters said.
    Earlier, a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' London
operations declined to comment at all on rumours that have been
circulating here.
    Euroyen bond traders had said they were informally
contacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that they
would no longer be market makers in those securities.
    The traders said that Salomon had not notified the
Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plans
to withdraw as a market maker. Under new rules recently adopted
by the AIBD, notification would be required if the firm decided
it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in
euroyen bonds.
    According to dealers at several Japanese banks, Salomon's
euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to
make prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered the
traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing
to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.
    Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bond
issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated
bonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as the
currency of choice for international borrowers.
    Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, the
yen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables.
    Last week, Salomon Brothers announced it would trim its
worldwide staff by 800 and withdraw from several areas of
business, most specifically short term bank lending.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - COMPANIES ON SIDELINES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The recent sharp rise in U.S. interest
rates sparked turmoil in the fixed-income markets, but
underwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush to
borrow before rates increase further.
    "Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when
they believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate," said an
underwriter with a major Wall Street house.
    Said another, "We will not see a flood of new offerings.
Treasurers are reassessing the market. We will not see new
issuance dry up either."
    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the public
finance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.
    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,
saw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was down
from the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion
dlrs of new debt.
    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those
amounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took
advantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance
old, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at
low, attractive rates, underwriters noted.
    "Companies will conduct financings that they believe are
essential," said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street
firm. "But we will not see much more than that until the market
stabilizes."
    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter
term issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nine
issues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.
    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,
with most clustered in the two to three year area, according to
a Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interest
rates were had last week only among two-year securities.
    "If people think that interest rates will continue to head
higher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market," said a
trader with a medium-sized securities house.
    "But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise
is a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to
decline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they are
not missing the boat by doing so," she added.
    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm
reception to new issues by institutional and retail investors
in recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrained
from buying because they believed rate would rise further.
    "We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people are
not yet willing to pull the trigger," a broker said. "They
would rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be
sustained."
    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest
rates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,
chief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly
"Comments on Credit" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bonds
would probably rise further because the marketplace expects
inflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.
    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that
prices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would
recover. The rating agency said neither the economy nor the
dollar justify current high yields.
    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold a
press briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list a
futures contract based on a corporate bond index.
    That follows last week's announcement by Commodity Exchange
Inc, Comex, that it plans to list on October 29 a new futures
contract based on the investment-grade corporate bond index of
Moody's Investors Service Inc.

<TITLE>FDIC'S SEIDMAN SAYS HIGHER RATES COULD HARM BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman
William Seidman said he would be concerned about the impact on
banks of a further sharp rise in interest rates.
    However, Seidman, attending the American Bankers
Association convention, said he did not expect rates to rise
much higher and said the outlook for the U.S. economy and for
banking was sound.
    "The potential for greater interest rate rises gives us
concern. We see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us
to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is
not sound," Seidman told a news conference.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to enter
the government securities market to supply reserves to the
banking system via system repurchase agreements, economists
said.
    Most economists said the Fed would execute three-day system
repurchases to meet a substantial need to add reserves in the
current maintenance period, although some said a more
aggressive add via overnight system repos was possible.
    Federal funds opened at 7-5/8 pct and remained at that
level late this morning, compared with an average effective
rate of 7.55 pct Friday.

<TITLE>FINANCIAL CORP &lt;FIN> LOAN SALES DOWN IN QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    IRVINE, Calif., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial Corp of America, in
reporting a third quarter loss, said gains on the sale of loans
and mortgage-backed securities, which has been the company's
main source of profit during the past two years, fell to 12.4
mln dlrs as compared to a 93.4 mln in the third quarter last
year.
    It said the income was reduced by adverse interest rate
fluctuations during the quarter.
    The company also said it made an additional provision of
70.4 mln dlrs to its reserve for losses on loans and real
estate, compared with 76.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
    Financial Corp said its reserve totaled 1.00 billion dlrs
at September 30, 1987, compared with a total of 580.4 mln at
the same time a year ago.
    Financial Corp, the nation's largest thrift, reported a
third quarter loss of 75.8 mln dlrs, or 2.20 dlrs per share,
compared with an 11.6 mln dlr profit last year.
    At the end of the quarter scheduled items, or non- or
under-performing assets, were 1.34 billion dlrs, or 4.01 pct of
total regulatory assets, down from 1.77 billion, or 5.20 pct of
assets at the end of the 1986 third quarter, the company said.
    In reporting third quarter results the company also said
its highest priority is to raise capital and strengthen its
financial base.
    "We are responsible to our shareholders and therefore are
exploring several alternatives for achieving value while
raising capital.
    "Any proposal to acquire or restructure the company will be
viewed by management from this perspective," Financial Corp
chairman William Popejoy said in a statement.
    Last month Financial Corp executives and Federal Home Loan
Bank Board members met to discuss a restructuring of FCA, with
help from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, as a
possible solution to the company's financial difficulties.
    In addition, Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> First Nationwide Financial
Corp, has acknowledged that it is interested in acquiring the
company.
    Financial Corp has said it needs about one billion dlrs to
bring its regulatory net worth up to Federal Government
requirements.
    In  addition, Financial Corp said its real estate group
sold properties totaling 154.8 mln dlrs in book value before
reserves during the quarter and 435.5 mln dlrs of real estate
for the nine months to September 30.
    The company also said it had a net deposit decrease of
415.4 mln dlrs during the quarter, resulting mainly from
institutional deposits reacting to the company's pricing
strategy and to its efforts to manage the cost of funds.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd, a
Hong Kong-based investment firm leading a group holding 19.1
pct of Calmat Co's common stock, said it intends to submit to
Calmat a proposal for a possible business combination.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Industrial Equity (Pacific) did not disclose details of the
proposal, but said it would be delivered to Calmat in the near
future.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific) "does not intend to remain a
passive investor" in Calmat, the firm told the SEC.
    In its SEC filing, Industrial Equity (Pacific) said its
president of North American operations Ronald Langley met with
Calmat officials on October 14 to discuss an acquisition of the
company at a premium over the market price of Calmat stock.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific) added it is considering
launching a tender offer for Calmat stock or making a merger
proposal to the company, but said it has not decided whether it
will pursue a Calmat acquisition on a non-negotiated basis.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific), which currently holds 5.83 mln
Calmat common shares, said it is also evaluating the company's
recently adopted shareholder rights plan and its potential
effect on Calmat and on possible acquisition proposals made to
the company.
    Between October 2 and 14, Industrial Equity (Pacific)
bought 918,900 shares of Calmat common stock at 33 dlrs to
37.55 dlrs a share, or a total of about 33.8 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Iowa State University study showed
pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
between the study and the USDA handbook.
    "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"
Kline said.
    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

<TITLE>SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Barber</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union outlined its economic
targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
output of a country's goods and services.
    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
world markets.
    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
compared with the same period last year.
    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
for the industry for the whole of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources," he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
figure as was announced last year.
    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
intertwined with the civilian economy.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
insurance schemes.

<TITLE>TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The official Soviet news agency Tass
denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
    "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
the latest military adventure will not bring political
dividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
presence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
    Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of
armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
long been spoken of by Washington officials."

Union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the
end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to
be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.
    Until now, car phones have been linked with land stations
and have been limited mainly to urban areas. The new ruling
will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.
    The meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided
to allow a "radio determination satellite system," which would
enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the
movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>IDC Services Inc said a new company will
begin a cash tender offer by October 26 to acquire all of IDC's
outstanding common for 16 dlrs a share.
    The company said the offer is being made under a definitive
agreement reached with the new company, IDC Acquisition Corp,
formed by Apollo Partners Ltd and investment clients of
&lt;Equitable Capital Management Inc>. The agreement calls for the
acquisition of IDC for about 62.4 mln dlrs.
    IDC Acquisition will also tender for all of IDC's
outstanding nine pct convertible subordinated debentures.
   
    IDC said the merger agreement also provides for payment of
an equivalent amount in respect of employee stock options to be
cancelled in the merger.
    As part of the transaction, the company said, it granted
IDC Acquisition an option to acquire up to 20 pct of the
company's outstanding shares for 16 dlrs per share.
    It said the planned tender offer is subject to several
conditions, including the tendering of over 50 pct of the
company's outstanding stock.
   
    MIM Holdings Ltd &lt;MIMA.S>, a substantial shareholder in
IDC, has agreed it will not buy any additional IDC shares until
February seven and has granted IDC Acquisition a right of first
refusal on any IDC shares it sells during that period, the
company said.
    It said Apollo Partners was recently organized by three
former senior Viacom Inc &lt;VIA> executives, Terrence A. Elkes,
George C. Catell and Kenneth F. Gorman.

<TITLE>CALFED &lt;CAL> POSTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>CalFed Inc said strong loan volume
and higher net increase income at its principal subsidiary,
the California Federal Savings and Loan Association,
contributed to the best third-quarter and nine-month results in
the company's history.
    On a per-share basis, CalFed's fully diluted earnings were
1.80 dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 and 4.87 dlrs for the
nine months ended Sept 30, 1987, compared with 1.75 dlrs and
4.76 dlrs in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed is a 23.1 bln dlr diversified financial-services
company.
    "Key factors leading to the company's higher earnings were
continued strong loan volume, an increase in net interest
income and higher earnings from non-real estate sources," said
George Rutland, president and chief executive officer of the
firm of CalFed Inc.
    Net earnings in the third quarter of 1987 were 50 mln dlrs,
a 3.1 pct gain over 48.5 mln in the same period last year. They
increased 3.9 pct in the first nine months of this year
compared with last year, totalling 134.6 mln dlrs against 129.6
mln.
    California Federal Savings and Loan Association contributed
net earnings of 44.5 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987
compared with 43.4 mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the
nine-month period ended Sept 30, it had net earnings of 116.3
mln dlrs against 114.9 mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    California Federal's net interest income for the third
quarter of 1987 rose 18.1 pct to 131.6 mln dlrs, up from 111.4
mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the first nine months of
1987, it totalled 383 mln dlrs, a 13.9 pct increase over 336.2
mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed Inc said that the increase in its subsidiary's net
interest income was a result of higher average balances of
interest-earning assets for the savings and loan operations.
    CalFed said the savings and loan unit's loan originations
were unchanged in the third quarter of 1987 compared with last
year at 1.8 billion dlrs. But for the first nine months of
1987, they rose to 5.4 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion in 1996.
    California Federal's provision for loan losses rose to 19.4
mln dlrs in the 1987 third quarter compared with 15.5 mln last
year and to 63.3 mln for first the nine months of 1987 compared
with 30.6 mln.

<TITLE>BANK PURCHASE SLOWS SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> said
growth in its third-quarter earnings was slowed by the purchase
of Rainier Bancorp and the suspension of interest payments on
Brazilian and Ecuadorian loans that were placed on a
non-accrual status earlier this year.
    The bank said it earned 128.1 mln dlrs in the third
quarter, up from 118.3 mln a year earlier. On a per-share
basis, income was 1.16 dlrs a share, up from 1.09 dlrs.
    The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrs
associated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlr
Seattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.
    Security Pacific also said the suspension of interest
payments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced net
income by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.
    Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier on
August 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated to
reflect the "pooling-of-interests" acquisition.
    "Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearly
demonstrating the stability and balance in our earnings
streams," said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executive
officer. "The addition of Rainier," he continued, "adds very
significantly to the strength of our western banking network."
    The inclusion of Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest earnings
affected comparison of most financial categories.
    Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was 602.4 mln
dlrs, up from 538.6 mln. The suspension of interest payments on
Brazilizan and Ecuadorian debt reduced net interest income by
41.9 mln dlrs.
    Non-interest income rose to 471.6 mln dlrs from 412.1 mln.
    Third-quarter provision for credit losses was 89.6 mln
dlrs, down 17.9 mln dlrs. As a percentage of average loans and
lease financing, net credit losses were 0.68 pct, down from
0.79 pct a year earlier.
    Non-performing loans and leases were 2.038 billion dlrs at
the end of the quarter, or 3.96 pct of loans and leases, up
from 1.377 billion a year ago.
    Other non-interest expense, composed of staff and other
expenses, was 757.6 mln dlrs, up from 616.2 mln. The rise
included an increase in staff expenses to 379.7 mln dlrs from
313.0 mln dlrs.
    Excluding Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest, average loans grew
11 pct. Real estate and international loan growth had the
greatest rises of 16 pct and 15 pct, respectively.
    Shareholders equity was 3.486 billion dlrs at the end of
the third quarter, up from 3.381 billion.
    The primary capital ratio was 7.41 pct, based on period-end
capital and quarterly average assets, up from 7.01 pct a year
earlier.

<TITLE>IC INDUSTRIES &lt;ICX> MAY SELL AEROSPACE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>IC Industries Inc said its board approved
a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of
the company.
    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and
defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
maximum value to shareholders.
    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
services field.
    The company said it authorized a program to repurchase
between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock
from time to time when conditions warrant.
    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
"across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targeted
areas.
    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the
company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The
company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.

<TITLE>CAIRNS GROUP SAID INFLUENTIAL IN TRADE TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian Minister for Trade
Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World
commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group
against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
    Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major
agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,
has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral
trade talks. "There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being
seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other
international trade negotiations," he said.
    Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United
States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said
considerable progress has been made by the group towards
fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed
countries.
    The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper
will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its
Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.
    He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a
determination to resist the currently strong protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. Congress.

in July to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in June but fell from 1.22
billion in July last year, the State Statistics Institute said.
    The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billion
dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year
earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at
6.76 billion.
    The government aims to narrow the current account deficit
for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52
billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.
    Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion
dlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow
considerably in the last five months following a massive
drawdown of inventories.

to repay loans owed by a private company to speed up the
signing of a 13.2 billion dlr rescheduling agreement with
foreign banks.
    It concerns a Barclays Bank managed loan to fertilizer
company Planter Products Inc, said Teofisto Paterno, chairman
of the foreign debt committee.
    President Corazon Aquino had accused some creditor banks of
"non-too-subtle coercion" in threatening to refuse to sign the
rescheduling accord until the loan problem was settled.
    Over 30 of Philippines' 483 creditor banks still have to
sign the agreement before the November 15 deadline.

<TITLE>SWISS ANALYSTS SAY MOOD ON MARKETS PRECARIOUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Nordberg and Michael Shields</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and
matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the
mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities
analysts and economists said.
    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening
on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and
the threat of renewed currency instability.
    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been
in the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of
European research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary
authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary
policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise
currencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, we
will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest
rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United
States will raise rates."
    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in
Zurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the
U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."
    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's
financial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"
but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks
loosen their monetary policy.
    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," he
said. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in
with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an
economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."
    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearly
exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation
certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.
    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction
would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors
only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be
another, smaller selling wave.
    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --
then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. But
that may not come soon.
    "People are simply worried that in America, where the market
has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"
he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."
    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current
problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have a
mark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said the
biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the
dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest
rates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't do
that," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall back
into the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence in
Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."
    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.
    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimistic
because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to
intervene."
    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take
any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention
remains on the United States.
    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."
    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting
they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before
deciding what to do.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told
the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
    In the first nine months of this year, industrial output
rose by 3.6 pct.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
harvest this year.
    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering
industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.
    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the
7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources," he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet
defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
same as announced last year.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase
spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
social insurance schemes
    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had
originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

company's broadcast licenses.
    RKO General said "the decision was based on allegations of
misconduct that are either in error or have no bearing on our
fitness as a broadcaster."
    It said the decision did not challenge the quality of our
broadcasting. Yet, if the decision is allowed to stank, it will
destroy our right to broadcast."

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> PLANS COMPUTER USING SUN &lt;SUNW.O> CHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
it plans to build a new computer that incorrates a unified
version of its UNIX System IV operating system and Sun
Microsystems Inc's recently annouced SPARC micropocessor.
    The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-set
computing, or RISC, technology. 
    ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer will
incorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, a
dirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific and
engineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant of
the Berkely system sold by Sun.
    ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to develop
new computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged version
of the UNIX operating system.
    Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed Data
Systems Group, said the company will not offer the new machines
until the merged version of UNIX is completed.
    "It's the software that will determine the availability of
products based on SPARC," he said.
    Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will be
converted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.
   
    The investment of all current users will be protected,
meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used on
the current 3B line, he said.
    Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in the
first nine months of the year compared with the first nine
months of last year.
    The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT's
transition to a new line of computers, he said.
    However, "demand for the new products is way, way above
expectation," he stated.

<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rising service payments on Kenya's three
billion dlr external debt will absorb nearly all the 1.1
billion dlrs of foreign aid likely over the next four years,
President Daniel arap Moi said.
    "While we expect to receive 18.3 billion Kenyan shillings in
the form of external loans for our development programs in the
next four years, we will be repaying more than 13.5 billion...
By way of external debt servicing...," Moi told a conference of
American businessmen in Nairobi.
    The president added that if developing countries continue
to experience foreign exchange outflows on this scale, many
will be unable to sustain a level of imports necessary to
ensure economic growth. He called on the international
community to ensure a real transfer of resources from the
industrialised to the developing countries.
    Moi said Kenya had so far met all obligations regarding its
foreign debt, which his government has never tried to
reschedule.

&lt;VOWG.F> and Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> Latin American joint venture,
was expected to make losses of 500 mln marks from Brazilian
operations in 1987, VW spokesman Ortwin Witzel said.
    He could not comment on a report in the Frankfurter

in 1986 to incorporate VW's and Ford's Brazilian and Argentine
operations. Ford holds 49 pct of Autolatina.
    Witzel blamed Autolatina's losses on Brazil's government
price restrictions but said the losses were in line with
expectations. VW's Brazil unit lost 258 mln marks in 1986.

<TITLE>U.S. NAVAL FORCES ATTACK IRANIAN OIL PLATFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. warships attacked and destroyed
an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's
Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.
    When asked how much was left of the oil platform,
Weinberger said, "Nothing."
    "There was no Iranian reaction," he said. "... We consider
this matter is now closed."
    Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform
about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire
at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
    "We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with
and be a source of potential attack on convoys...," Weinberger
said at a Pentagon briefing. 
    "We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...
    "It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
U.S. forces in the future," Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran
with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
    He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
    "As far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.
    Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to
attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile
platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said
its subsidiary &lt;Hong Kong Telephone Co Ltd> would cease to be a
listed company, following the restructure of the company's Hong
Kong units.
    Earlier today the company announced that Hong Kong
Telephone and Cable and Wireless Hong Kong, in which the
territory's government has a 20 pct stake, would become
subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, Hong Kong
Telecommunications.
    In exchange for the Cable and Wireless Hong Kong capital,
Hong Kong Telecommunications will issue 4.18 billion new shares
to Cable and Wireless Plc's Cable and Wireless (Far East) Ltd.
    That subsidiary now holds the group's 80 pct stake in Cable
and Wireless Hong Kong and about 22 pct of H.K. Telephone.
    It will issue an additional 1.05 billion shares to the
goverment.
    That will leave the Cable and Wireless group with an 80 pct
stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, the government 11 pct
and nine pct in public hands.
    But that will be reduced early next year after a placement
of 11 pct of the issued shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications
by both Cable and Wireless and the government.

<TITLE>GAF &lt;GAF> GROUP RECONSIDERS BUYOUT BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WAYNE, N.J., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAF Corp said the management group
led by chairman Samuel J. Heyman intends to reconsider its
proposal to acquire GAF.
    On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and
2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated
debentures due 2007 for each GAF share.  Heyman owns about
2,700,000 of GAF's 33.5 mln shares outstanding.
    In a letter to the committee of independent directors
formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to
modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due
to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.
    Heyman said "In the considerable time that has elapsed
since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and
financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost
unprecedented deterioration.  As of the present time, the
average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to
raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since
the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."
    He said the group intends to promptly review all available
options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current
market conditions.

<TITLE>S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,
said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
figures later in the week.
    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current
account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
7.03 billion dlrs.
    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with
the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid
revaluation of the won against the dollar.
    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.
    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many
public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.
    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a
resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
month.
    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
between July and September.
    The South Korean government originally targeted a five
billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
boom.
    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United
States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
Seoul last year, government economists said.
    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to
American goods and revalue the won faster.
    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,
representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

<TITLE>AIRCRAFT ATTACK IRANIAN OIL RIGS IN SOUTHERN GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian
oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least
one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had
reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike
against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh
offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a
wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from
the Rostam field soon after.
    At least one of the other two targets was also believed to
be ablaze, the sources said.
    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran
attack but would not say what the decision was.

Friedrich Wilhelm Christians said he believed the Louvre accord
on currency stability was still intact.
    Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term
German interest rates had risen twice.
    "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the dollar is still within
the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the accord has been
terminated," Christians said. He was responding to questions
about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was still
operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.

<TITLE>SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
the next five years, oil industry sources said.
    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
Arabian LPG, the sources said.
    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi
is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.
    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
in that area," said another trader.
    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
other ports.
    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
supply disruptions, traders said.
    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
year ended March 1987, the sources said.
    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
the spot market, they said.
    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
of Arabian Light.
    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
Light's GSP.
    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
the trade sources said.
    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
seller-buyer agreement.
    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said
an official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for
cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
longer haul and war risk insurance payments."
    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
current levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we
would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
high dependence on a single supplier," said one.

<TITLE>LUX FRANC BOND MARKET STALLED BY BELGIAN CRISIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The thriving market in Luxembourg
franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgian
government crisis which has put the franc under pressure and
forced up interest rates, banking sources said.
    On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation of
Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked
him to try to form a new government.
    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA
(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg
francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL
director Robert Sharfe said.
    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.
    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest
rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, banking
sources said. However, no new placements are scheduled for
another 10 days.
    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp
(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues
the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.
    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity
with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.
    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month
Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian
franc came under pressure.
    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become
increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,
because they carry a relatively low interest rate.
    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc
bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong
currency.

<TITLE>NBC NEWS SAYS U.S. HAS RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. television networks said on
Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against
Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms.
    NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled
from the sea.
    It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday
and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze
as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that
U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
    U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship.
    President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
not say what the decision was.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai traders plan to establish a company
to regulate maize forward trading, in what could be a first
step towards a commodities futures exchange, maize dealers
said.
    Traders and Internal Trade Department officials agreed last
week to commission a study on a structure to regulate maize
forward trading and to set up a company, Thailand Commodity
Exchange Co Ltd, with 30 businesses as shareholders who will
act as brokers in the futures market.
    Chanthong Pattamapong, a commodities trader asked to to
draw up the study, said if the maize futures market succeeds it
may be extended to other commodities, perhaps sugar and rubber.

<TITLE>INDIAN RESERVE BANK TIGHTENS CREDIT POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOMBAY, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank of India said it was
tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising
their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from
October 24.
    The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's
policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and
is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.
    The central bank also put selective controls on bank
advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.
    "The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit
requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while
preventing excessive monetary expansion," bank Governor R.N.
Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.
    Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept
under control in the second half of the current financial year.
    Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six
months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same
period last year, according to the bank.
    Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve
ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees
from the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated at
around 1,000 billion rupees.
    They said banks are under pressure because of low returns
on commercial lending and investments in government securities.
    "Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain
their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are
resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings," said one banker.

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian police denied rumours of
race riots in Kuala Lumpur after an armed man killed one person
and injured two others in an attack on two petrol stations in a
racially-sensitive area of the city.
    A police statement broadcast over official Radio Malaysia
called on the public not to listen to the rumours and go about
their normal business.
    "Everything is under control. It's only a small matter and
there is no cause for alarm," a police spokesman told Reuters
after confirming the shooting on Sunday night.

    However, rumours that riots had broken out hit the stock
market and shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange fell
across the board in heavy nervous selling when the market
opened this morning, brokers said.
    Police said they cordoned off the district of Chow Kit and
set up road blocks from midnight after the man, armed with a
rifle, killed one Malay and injured another Malay and a
Chinese. He set fire to one of the petrol stations.

<TITLE>PUMA FIRST-HALF LOSS ABOUT 14 MLN MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport &lt;PUMA.F> said
it posted a 1987 first-half group loss of about 14 mln marks,
of which the largest portion was in the U.S.
    Managing board chairman Armin Dassler told the annual
shareholders' meeting parent company turnover was expected to
fall to 650 mln marks over the whole year from 698.4 mln in
1986.
    No comparative figure for 1986 first half group loss was
available. In the whole of 1986 Puma posted a group
consolidated loss of 41.05 mln marks.
    Dassler said Puma hoped to improve performance in the U.S.
This year, where heavy losses were mainly responsible for the
1986 deficit.
    He said Puma expected to post a group loss in the second
half of this year but the shortfall would be lower than in the
first half. The same applied to expected parent company losses,
he added.
    Dassler said Puma had taken measures to improve future
performance.
    Dassler said the measures included changing Puma's  
product range, closing down some unprofitable factories in West
Germany and France and introducing general cost-cutting.
    He said Puma hoped to break even in 1988 in the U.S., Its
most important export market.
    Dassler said a personal payment he would make to
shareholders instead of a 1986 dividend was a goodwill gesture
which would not be repeated.
    Dassler said the payment to holders of Puma's 280,000
non-voting preference shares would amount to about 1.2 mln
marks, or 4.50 marks per share.
    Armin Dassler and his brother Gerd hold all of Puma's
720,000 ordinary voting shares. They offered the preference
shares to the public in July last year.
    Dassler said shareholders would benefit if Puma improved
performance next year. He did not elaborate.
    Dassler said he and his brother were planning to leave the
managing board and join the supervisory board.
    He said he was leaving for health reasons and because he
wanted to make way for a new chairman from outside the company.
His successor has not been made known yet.
    Dassler said today's meeting was expected to approve
Manfred Emcke as Puma's new supervisory board chairman,
replacing Vinzenz Grothgar.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Yemen is planning a major oil
pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start
exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the
Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
    MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
    The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
the industry newsletter said.
    The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
     MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
    The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms
east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> and Volkswagen
AG &lt;VOWG.F> are considering raising the local procurement rate
at their West German joint venture to at least 60 pct from an
earlier planned 50 pct after one year's output, a Toyota
spokesman said.
    The two carmakers agreed last June to start jointly
producing a Toyota-designed light truck at VW's Hanover plant
from early 1989 at a rate of 7,000 to 8,000 the first year,
rising to 15,000 from 1990.
    They may equip the light truck with a Volkswagen-made
engine to reach a local procurement rate of 60 pct, he said.

    The two companies need to raise the value of locally
procured parts to 60 pct to avoid tariffs when they export to
other European markets, industry sources said.

<TITLE>GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own," said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime
Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two
leading Venezuelan newspapers reported.
    The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would
leave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his
successor, the El Nacional reported.
    Central Bank officials were not available for comment.

    Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance
Ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction
of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are
currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance
Ministry and government officials who thought an interest
increase would fuel inflation.

<TITLE>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.

    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them," he added.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>King Baudouin is expected to accept the
resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens's
centre-right coalition government after last-ditch talks failed
to solve a language row, state-run RTBF radio said.
    The King could ask Martens or another political leader to
put together a new government or to form a caretaker
administration with elections at the end of November or in
early December.
    The King has so far withheld a decision on whether to
accept the resignation last Thursday of Martens's coalition of
Dutch and French speaking parties over the linguistic conflict.

    Martens has used the breathing space to try to put together
a compromise solution but RTBF and the Belgian news agency
Belga said leading ministers ended their talks early on Monday
morning without agreement.
    "The resignation of the government will no doubt be accepted
by the King in the near future," RTBF said.
    The King has no formal deadline for announcing his decision
but has been widely expected to do so on Monday.

    The government's National Resistance Army (NRA) closed the

But by the time NRA reinforcements arrived the rebels had
disappeared into thick forest. The road and a parallel railway

    Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting

    The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman

    The radio said the spokesman made the statement "following
the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the U.S. Flag and comments
by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action
against Iran."
    The spokesman said, "Any U.S. Military aggression against
Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in
the Persian Gulf, and amidst this our principled policy is to
confront any act which escalates tension."

<TITLE>HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ho Wah Foon</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's recovery from the worst
recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
after seven years of austerity, economists said.
    "Our country is walking on one leg now," said Ismail Salleh,
an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies. "It has to depend on public sector investment for
faster growth if the private sector is not moving."
    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
    One businessman said too many politicians give the
impression that Malaysia was unstable.
    "If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
to recover strongly is great," a banker said.
    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
    The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
    The government will also repay some of its external debt,
which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
goods are unlikely to change.
    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
compete for investors with neighbouring states.

<TITLE>CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
as saying.
    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
mln in the same 1986 period.
    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
the incentive for grain production.
    China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
said.
    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's
1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390
mln tonnes.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
said. Both were proposed last month.
    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
month.
    In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
Office said.
    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
prices.
    The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa must drive down its
inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further
decline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic
review.
    The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation
rate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,
regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.
    Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and
the rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate
continued high inflation.
    Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for
the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year.

<TITLE>SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption
since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
vodka sales, Pravda said.
    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
two billion bottles of moonshine.
    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
    "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
home-brew," Pravda said.
    "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first
step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been
seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

<DATELINE>    BEIRUT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lebanon's Bankers Association said it
extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for
two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's
collapse.
    The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the
dollar and other currencies on Monday. The pound closed on
Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.
    Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of
trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two
more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
    The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in
east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic
market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.
    The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously
and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil
war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this
year.

<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil)
&lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
statement.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
&lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.
    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55
pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S>
(13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> (nine pct) and &lt;Svenska
Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

<TITLE>LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly," the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he
added.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen
in bills from its holdings on Tuesday to help absorb a
projected money market surplus of 470 billion yen and recycle
400 billion in bills maturing then, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8512 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses through
29-day repurchase agreements maturing on November 17. These are
aimed at meeting a projected cash shortage on that day, when
the government floats 1.95 mln shares in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. The other 400 billion will yield 3.9006 pct
through 44-day repurchase accords maturing on December 2.
    The operation will bring the supply of bills outstanding to
about 3,200 billion yen.

<TITLE>NORSK DATA A/S SEES LOWER 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norwegian computer company Norsk Data A/S
&lt;NORK.OL> said weak sales outside of Europe have forced it to
lower its 1987 pre-tax profit forecast by 100 mln crowns and
its expected 1987 sales figure by about 150 mln crowns.
    Norsk Data said in August it expected to show a pre-tax
profit of between 550 and 600 mln crowns this year.
    The sales figure was lowered after it became clear sales in
North America and India would not match earlier predictions,
the company said in a statement, adding: "It is ... Doubtful
that this discrepancy can be compensated by a corresponding
extra increase in its European business."
    The company said its sales in Europe remained strong,
however, and were expected to grow by 25 to 35 pct in 1987.
    Norsk Data in August dropped a planned issue of new
non-voting shares in the United States, Norway and other
countries because of unfavourable market conditions.
    The move was seen by Oslo and London securities analysts as
a sign the company's rapid growth years might be over.
    Norsk Data showed a 177.9 mln crown pre-tax profit for the
first six months of 1987, up six pct from the year-ago figure
of 168 mln. Its 1986 pre-tax profit before year-end allocations
was 475 mln crowns against 364 mln in 1985.

<TITLE>ABE TIPPED TO BE NEXT JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>No clear indication has emerged of the
victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that
former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen.
    A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked
was expected late today or early on Tuesday, they said.
    Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door
meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone, who
is due to step down late this month, to mediate to break the
deadlock.
    The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita.
    They are vying for the post of president of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is automatically prime
minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.
    The new LDP president will be named formally at a party
convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by
parliament, probably on November 6, LDP sources said.
    Nakasone, 69, is due to retire on October 31 after five
years in the post, an exceptionally long term by Japanese
standards.
    Takeshita, who is head of the party's largest faction, had
steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help, but he
told reporters: "It is possible Nakasone will be given carte
blanche (for selection of his successor)."
    One political analyst, who declined to be identified, said
Nakasone, despite a personal preference for Miyazawa, is likely
to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through
its international problems and maintaining party unity. Abe
also would also accept Nakasone's influence, he said. Analysts
said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as
possible following his retirement.
    Takeshita, the early favorite because of the size of his
faction, is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being
unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack
of international experience.
    The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to
support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their
political styles.

pct in the three months ended August 31 due to better sales of
electronic materials and components, which grew 9.2 pct
compared with the same period of 1986.
    Net profit gained only 0.5 pct due to lower interest income
and exchange losses which depressed non-operating income, it
said. It earlier reported net up to 4.20 billion from 4.18
billion in the year earlier period after sales up to 95.96
billion from 92.59 billion. The proportion of overseas sales to
total sales fell to 45.2 pct from 45.6 pct a year earlier due
to lower tape sales to North America.

<TITLE>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them," he added.

<TITLE>RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Rubber Organisation
(INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had
shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
    "We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in
proper conditions does not deteriorate," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold
since he entered the market in September would be discussed at
an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.
    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in
buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible
poor quality.
    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's
five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October
16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
was uppermost in consumers' minds.
    "We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand
the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber
before they carry on buying," he said.
    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different
locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
past week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and see
attitude" by buyers, he said.
    "Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,
they are likely to buy more." Hofmeister said he could reduce
the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.
    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates
that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur
and New York since September.
    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an
idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council
meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.
    The current international rubber pact expires on October
22.
    The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and
Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
the interim period.

<TITLE>ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

<TITLE>IRAN PRESIDENT DOUBTS U.S. ACTION AGAINST IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian President Ali Khamenei said he
doubted the U.S. Was in position to take violent action against
Iran in the Gulf, Tehran Radio reported.
    The U.S. Government "is in a very difficult situation now
and it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a
violent action," the radio quoted him as saying in an interview
with the English language daily Tehran Times.
    In Washington, President Ronald Reagan said he had decided
on a response to Iran, which the Americans blame for two
missile attacks on U.S.-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters last
week, but declined to say what the response was.
    Khamenei said the U.S. Government had to take some action
to demonstrate its authority, "but on the other hand any violent
act in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term U.S.
Interests," the radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported.
    On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, Khamenei
said: "Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be
concurrent. Formation of a panel to determine the aggressor
necessarily preceeds the ceasefire."
    He also rejected a peace-keeping committee or a buffer
force as instruments to implement a July 20 U.N. Security
Council order for a ceasefire in the seven-year-old Gulf war.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand has imposed sanctions
against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
10 mln dlrs a year.
    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
    "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"
Palmer said.
    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
back from declaring a republic.
    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from
Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the
Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in
Hawaii on his way home from Vancouver.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of Finance has started to
consider the coupon rate of the 10-year government bond issue
for November, a Ministry official said.
    The underwriting syndicate may want a rise in the coupon
rate by nearly one point from the current 4.9 pct, he said. But
bond traders see a rise to about 5.6 pct as most likely.
    Ministry officials will try to keep the rate low to meet
U.S. Requests for maintenance of the interest rate differential
between the U.S. And Japan, the Ministry official told Reuters.
    Plans for an October issue were cancelled when the Ministry
and the bond underwriting syndicate failed to reach agreement
on terms.
    The underwriting syndicate will start negotiating with the
Finance Ministry on the terms of the November issue after any
changes in the prime rate for November are decided, which
should be by the end of this week, an underwriting source said.
    Cancellation of the November bond issue is not out of the
question, he said, adding that negotiations are expected to be
difficult.

<TITLE>UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to
Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
December and the factory should be ready by next October.
    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee
Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000
tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan
from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.
    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
latest International Coffee Agreement.
    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be
substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.
    The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of
which is used to produce instant coffee.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union has agreed to supply
Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
left for Moscow.
    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
products.
    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at
the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the
Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.

<TITLE>COMPETITION TOUGHENS FOR NEAR-SUPERCOMPUTERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Catherine Arnst</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An announcement by Alliant Computer
Systems Inc &lt;ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and &lt;ETA
Systems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the same
category show competition is stiff in this market, industry
analysts said.
     Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer, aimed mainly
at scientists and researchers will be priced between 100,000
and 200,000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that
price range. But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in
line with discounts it now gives many of its customers.
    "(The new FX) is significant to the extent that it
represents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the
marketplace," said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the
new computer. "The list price is more in line with what they are
seeing anyway."
    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,
resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but
are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.
    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but
mini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrs
and one mln dlrs.
    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture
called parallel processing, in which a problem is broken up
into segments and each segment assigned to a different
processor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just one
processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,
making them too slow for complex scientific problems.
    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about
five years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant and
Convex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successful
initial public offerings last year.
    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facing
some 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in
sales this year, and the result has been lower prices and
shrinking profit margins.
    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientific
market, lack of software and too many competitors also have
made analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.
    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,
said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for
the industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in
1991, instead of 1990.
    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their
third quarter earnings would be reduced by "competitive pricing
pressures."
    Alliant said profits for the period will be about five
cents a share against eight cents last year, although revenues
for the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.
    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the
second quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise
almost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18
and 18.5 mln dlrs.
    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at the
bottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETA
System's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant
from the top, analysts said.
    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp &lt;CDC>, introduced
two machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar
to those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggest
supercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapest
model. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is
1.2 mln dlrs.
    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may
be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at
the upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.
    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of
software, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces all
parallel processor makers to some degree.
    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has
yet to be widely used, third party software vendors have been
slow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.
    ETA, however, "offers a low priced entry into supercomputers
for some customers," one consultant said.
    Canin cautioned that "the price pressures will continue for
some time" and estimated that five percentage points have been
knocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant
this year by price discounting.
    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new set
of problems as they both introduce their second generation of
products. "I am always cautious about the first major product
transition."

<TITLE>TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
    "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"
Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
as 135 yen soon.

<TITLE>SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union's industrial output is
growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
pct.
    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
irrespective of quality.
    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
standard.
    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
rejected in the nine-month period.
    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
economy has been an important part of the modernisation
campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
setting up of small shops on a private basis.
    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
194 roubles a year ago.

<TITLE>PROJECTIONS SHOW SWISS VOTERS WANT TRIED PARTIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The prospect of a dominant alliance of
socialists and environmentalists ended as the Social Democrats
became the biggest losers in Swiss parliamentary elections.
    Projections by Swiss radio show the ruling centre-right
alliance of Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and the People Party will likely hold on to power.
    Less than 48 pct of voters cast a ballot, a record low
turnout. The moderate left-of-centre Social Democrats lost six
of its previous 47 seats. The Green Party of Switzerland won 11
seats in the 200-seat lower house, a rise of eight. But the
Green Alliance and other green groupings lost one seat.
    The Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and People Party are forecast to hold 159 seats, down
seven from the last election in 1983, and 42 of the 46 seats in
the upper house, down one.
    The projections showed the centre-right Radical Democrats
dropping four seats to 50 in the lower house, although they
would remain the largest party.
    The conservative Christian Democrats were seen losing one
seat to 41, while the right-wing People's Party, despite
forecast losses, added four to their previous 23 seats.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXCHANGE INTRODUCES INSTITUTIONAL INDEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Stock Exchange said it has
introduced options with expirations of up to three years on the
Institutional Index.
    With the ticker symbol &lt;XII>, the index is a guage of the
core equity holdings of the nation's largest institutions, the
exchange explained.
    The new listings represent the first long-term options to
be traded by the Amex, it added.
    It said the long-term Institutional Index options began
trading Monday with expirations of December 1988 &lt;XIV> and
December 1989 &lt;XIX>.
   
    The Amex said a third long-term option with an expiration
of December 1990 will begin trading following the December 1987
expiration.
    It said strike prices on the long-term options have been
set at 50 point intervals with initial strikes of 250, 300 and
350. To avoid conflicting strike price codes, the 350 stike
prices will carry the ticker symbols &lt;XVV> for the option
expiring in December 1988 and &lt;XVX> for the option expiring in
December 1989.
