<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

    Moody's said Marathon Oil Co's recent establishment of up

prolific Yates Field has significant negative implications for
USX's unsecured creditors.
    The company appears to have positioned its steel segment
for a return to profit by late 1987, Moody's added.
    Ratings lowered include those on USX's senior debt to BA-1
from BAA-3.

quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln
dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said any decline would be due to expenses
related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current
quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of
the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.
    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales
will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.
    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in
late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early
April this year.
    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,
including conducting appraisals, in connection with the
acquisitions.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

<TITLE>DEAN FOODS &lt;DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
after for years," Douglas told analysts.

<TITLE>BROWN-FORMAN &lt;BFDB> SETS STOCK SPLIT, UPS PAYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brown-Forman Inc said its board
has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
in the company cash dividend.
    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
common shares would be effective March 13.
    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

<TITLE>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place," one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

<TITLE>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Gelb, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission report, which
says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
report made public today.
    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials."
    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?"
    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences," it said.
    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes," Tower told reporters.
    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the Senate to the Democrats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of previously owned homes
dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors
(NAR) said.
    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the
highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in
November 1978, the group said.
    "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a
significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up
of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment
under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

<TITLE>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sugar imports subject to the U.S.
sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial
week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons
versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture
Department said.
    The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year

compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was

    The department said the Customs Service has reported that
weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight
basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative
import data are adjusted accordingly.

<TITLE>BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's "Cruzado" anti- </DATELINE><BODY>inflation
plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

<TITLE>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln
dlrs.
    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline
in the value of the dollar.
    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital
expenditures.
    Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two
cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year
ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina could suspend payments on
its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr
loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party
Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.
    "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the
negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth
of the country," he added.
    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New
York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,
told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the
banks were divided on the loan request.
    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day
of talks had been postponed.
    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of
Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest
payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was
to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in
1987, Baglini said.
    "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own
pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest
payments," he added.

<TITLE>KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

<TITLE>CANADA'S WILSON SEEKS TEMPORARY BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson
said he will use temporary authority under the Financial
Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next
Thursday's treasury bill auction.
    In a statement, Wilson said the action would permit the
government to proceed with its debt program during a period
when there was not sufficient borrowing authority, which is
granted by Parliament, to cover the government's needs.
    Ottawa announced previously it was seeking Parliamentary
approval for the additional authority to cover the financing of
an increase in the government's foreign reserves.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Arraf, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president
Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.
    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue
Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.
    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This
is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in Canada.
    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North
America, analysts have said.
    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term," Peladeau said.
    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>
does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to
myself...next time we'll be ready."
    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.
    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49
pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's
540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will
have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build
another mill to meet their demands .
    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or
other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be
on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed
area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the
government.
    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures
with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in
France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large
printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.
    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would
provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are
prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would
consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in
France or the U.S.
    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of
about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of
two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating
the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,
Peladeau said.
    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers
in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the
province.
    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its
listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock
Exchange listing.

<TITLE>IRAN ANNOUNCES END OF MAJOR OFFENSIVE IN GULF WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran announced tonight that its major
offensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing
savage blows against the Baghdad government.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in
London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into
Iraq on January 9 was now over.
    It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and
Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had
"dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the
history of the Iraq-imposed war."
    The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to
herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in
southern Iraq.
    "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad
government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance
power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA.
    It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive
and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and
discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in
Iraq.
    Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of
enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken
over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into
Basra.
    The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the
statement said.
    It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally
destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The
victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti-
aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and
the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TITLE>COLECO INDUSTRIES &lt;CLC> SEES PROFIT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST HARTFORD, Conn., FEb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coleco Industries Inc said
it expects to return to profitability in 1987.
    Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for
the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln
dlrs in the year earlier.
    In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic
swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep
decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln
dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.
    Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a
more diversified organization through four major acquisitions
last year.
    Products from the new acquisitions and other new product
introductions are expected to enable it to return to
profitability, it said.
    At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president
Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts
a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.

<TITLE>GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
told Reuters.
    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.
    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

<TITLE>Venezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Caracas, feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and
flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
manuel azpurua told a press conference.
    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are
progressing."
    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
according to its own interest.
    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."
    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
Venezuela wants.
    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
loans.
    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
    "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
financing is guaranteed," azpurua said.
    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
payments, "because circumstances change too quickly."
    At the same time, he said the government is presently
studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
central bank.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a
unit of Thomson McKinnon Inc, is offering 100 mln dlrs of
collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that
include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.
    The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an
initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis
points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.
    The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average
life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an
initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.
    Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2
pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).
    A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse
floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The
yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.
    The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were
assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's and secured
by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, Freddie Mac, certificates.

<TITLE>OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cenergy Corp reported fourth quarter net
income of 790,000 dlrs or seven cts per share on revenues of
7.7 mln dlrs.
    For the year it reported a net loss of 6.5 mln dlrs or 70
cts per share as a result of writedowns in the book value of
its oil and gas properties in the first two quarters. Revenues
were 37 mln dlrs.
    Following the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1985,
it changed to a calender year end.
    For the nine months ended Dec 31, 1985, it reported a loss
of 63.4 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs per share on revenues of 47.6 mln
dlrs, which it said was a result of noncash writedowns of oil
and gas properties.
    For the year ended March 31, 1985, Cenergy reported net
income of 3,705,000 dlrs or 36 cts per share on revenues of 71
mln dlrs.
    The company said its reserves during the year fell to five
mln barrels from 6.4 mln barrels of oil and to 60.1 bilion
cubic feet of gas from 63.7 BCF. It said these reserves did not
disappear but are available to produce as prices recover.

<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova, the Canadian company that
owns 56 pct of Husky Oil Ltd, said it received government
approval for a transaction under which &lt;Union Faith Canada
Holding Ltd> would buy a 43 pct stake in Husky.
    Nova said the Minister of Regional and Industrial
Expansion, Michel Cote, ruled that Union Faith's purchase of
the Husky stake would not result in Husky ceding control to a
non-Canadian company. It said this ruling was a key condition
in completing the deal.
    Union Faith is equally owned by &lt;Hutchison Whampoa Ltd> and
&lt;Hong Kong Electric Holdings Ltd>.
    Under the agreement with Union Faith, Husky will become a
private company with Union Faith and Nova each holding 43 pct
of its stock.
    Nine pct of Husky would be owned by relatives of Li
Ka-Shing, chairman of Hutchison, and five pct by the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerice.

(FDIC) said three troubled banks in Texas and Louisiana were
merged with healthy financial institutions.
    The FDIC said it subsidized the merger of Central Bank and

that Central was in danger of failing.
    Central had assets of 28.3 mln dlrs.

Bank, Hart, Tex., were assumed by Hale County State Bank,
Plainview, Tex.
    Farmers, with 9.6 mln dlrs in assets, was closed by Texas
bank regulators.
    The deposits of the failed First National Bank of Crosby,
Crosby, Tex., with total assets of 8.2 mln dlrs, were assumed
by Central Bancshares of the South Inc, Birmingham, Ala., after
First National was closed by federal bank regulators, the FDIC
said.
    The number of federally insured banks to fail so far this
year now totals 32, the FDIC said.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to emulate Brazil's payments moratorium if the
banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Liquefied natural gas imports from
Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank
Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
higher by the end of 1987.
    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
    Company sources also said that any negotiations with
Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
values.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    "A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses," Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

<TITLE>REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sue Baker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    "Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president," the report said after a three-month probe.
    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages."
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser," said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

<TITLE>SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland's economy, combining low
unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, OECD, said.
    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
said.
    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
nation OECD area.
    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
respectively in 1986.
    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
would shrink in both years.
    But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
improving international balances," the OECD said.
    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
years of relative weakness, it noted.
    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
GDP, it added.
    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
after vigorous growth in 1986.
    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
earners of foreign exchange.
    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
    Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in
international financial markets give rise to the question
whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
basic, factual economics."
    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said it was willing
to participate with several other industrial countries in
providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.
    The Treasury announcecement did not name the other
countries nor the amount of financing the United States was
willing to supply.
    Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday
night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15
billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.
    "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral
short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's
economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable
balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.
    In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine
officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to
carry out structural changes in the economy.
    But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its
foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.
    The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for
Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.
    The one-page statement noted the International Monetary
Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and
prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for
it on February 18.
    "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF
balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to
repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation
of its economic program," the statement said.
    The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less
than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze
to restrain inflation.
    The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine
Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for
several days.
    Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower
interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign
debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of
the money is loaned in Argentina.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to follow Brazil in declaring a payments
moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>JURY FINDS FOR DOW &lt;DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dow Chemical Co's &lt;DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to
corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the
conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA
Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had
indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two
dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987
program this month.
    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the
department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who
enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.
    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to
demands that would follow from other commodity groups.

<TITLE>AGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.
    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission
said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in
cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency
evacuation planning.

grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the
government that they had done so probably will be allowed to
continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program
benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program
benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to
the acreage base for that crop.
    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that
farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown
oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt
oats production or lose corn program benefits.
    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats
but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.

National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

here today in NASA's first successful launch of the year.
    The 116-foot (35.4-meter) Delta -- a reliable workhorse of

    The launch came after two delays in two days. The first
postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by
high-speed crosswinds that NASA officials say could have torn
the rocket apart during fiery ascent.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has pledged to try to increase
its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to
monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.
    U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese
officials to try to force open the Japanese market to
American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five
billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.
    Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made
parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts
for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.
    He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try
to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to
monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.
    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that
"statistics support the perception in the United States that
American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner
circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional
suppliers."
    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five
billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.
firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market.

<TITLE>FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's right wing government is facing
growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
forecasts for this year.
    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
september.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
elections due by April 1988.
    "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"
said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the
impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
this year."
    "The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
moderation will be maintained," he added.
    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
justified by increased productivity.
    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
prices.
    Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," he
also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
government would spend two billion francs on a series of
measures to boost employment and training
    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
its top priority.
    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
    "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
government and I dont think this administration is going to
reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at
recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
said.
    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
    "But that would still be an exceptional achievement
considering that for the first time since the Second World War
all french prices have been freed," he commented.
    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
costs.
    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
as the government kept wages under control.
    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
he added.
    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
deficit, several analysts said.
    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
expected growth, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unadjusted consumer price index
(base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous
month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.
    The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1
pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct
in September 1958.
    Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell
for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall
decline for the month.
    Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January
compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities,
gasoline and vegetables fell.
    The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
(base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month
earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing
and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down
0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.

<TITLE>JAPAN MARCH BOND COUPON SEEN UNCHANGED AT FIVE PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has proposed
informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon
on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from
February at five pct, underwriting sources said.
    They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue
price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.
    The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record
low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the
600 billion in February.
    The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed
terms immediately, the sources said.

<TITLE>U.S. LAUNCHES WEATHER SATELLITE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unmanned Delta rocket
carrying a 57 mln dlr weather observation satellite blasted off
here today in the first U.S. Space launch of the year.
    The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305
GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace an
identical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocket
exploded after liftoff.
    Weather forecasters have had only a single satellite to
cover the entire U.S. Since another GOES failed in orbit in
August 1984.
    "We'll have both our weather eyes open again," said Thomas
Pyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which owns and operates the satellite.
    The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days.
The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerful
crosswinds.
    The Delta was the first of six rockets scheduled for launch
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year.
The launch marked the third straight success for the space
program which was battered by a series of failures in 1986,
including the loss of the Challenger shuttle.

<TITLE>ITALIAN COALITION MEETS AS GOVERNMENT CRISIS LOOMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of Italy's five coalition parties
have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences
which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's
Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats.
    Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said
Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week,
allowing negotiations on a new government leader.
    The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting
after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last
August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister's
job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled.
    Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely
to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social
Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister's
job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to
stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program
and sharing of ministries will not be easy.
    They said there is dissent among the partners and that
Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said
the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether
formation of a new government is feasible or early elections
are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988.

<TITLE>N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monetary and credit growth rates in
New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late
last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.
    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short
term money market, Russell said in a statement.
    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
October last year, Russell said.
    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of
17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in
the year ended September.
    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.
    "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,
including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting
differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading
banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese life insurers, trust banks and
corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond
market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the
U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.
    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,
Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on
similar types of investments, they said.
    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may
double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in
1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.
    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and
strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began
poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,
but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases
suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each
of the previous five months.
    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.
    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw
the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct
of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.
    "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first
because of its size and next because it has been successful
over the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managing
director of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,
enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in
and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.
    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.
They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.
    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which
concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover
payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.
Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,
manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed
income activities.
    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term
investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a
significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the
liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.
    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.
Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.
Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.
    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports
of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,
he added.
    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance
Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which
are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign
securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and
intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.
    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their
funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West
Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.
    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks
relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the
strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to
offset currency risks, he added.
    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct
annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in
U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund
investment stategies.
    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European
bonds, he said.
    Japanese investments in British equities have already
turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew
Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at
County Securities Japan.
    "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said.
    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of
British companies and the recent deregulation of government
controlled firms, fund managers said.
    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese
interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by
worries about the French franc, they said.
    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and
speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term
political stability, they added.
    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,
particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,
are concerned about the recent dollar fall.
    Australia also poses some risks due to currency values,
they added.

    A bank official told Reuters the increase came mainly from
increased local obu borrowings from their Asian counterparts.
    He said the assets, held by 15 foreign and local banks,
were mainly in U.S. Dollars with the remainder in certificates
of deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia
and the rest from North America and Europe, he added.

<TITLE>JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Domestic demand is now expected to make
no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
financial year and net export growth will provide the total
source of gdp growth.
    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
than first anticipated.
    "The government initially forecast a current account deficit
for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.
    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
broadly on track, Keating said.
    "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.
    "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
in domestic production and employment."
    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
    "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
effects wane," he said.
    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
private domestic demand.
    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
strengthening in real household disposable income.
    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
    "The current account deficit will continue to show
improvement in 1987/88," Keating said.
    "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
years recede further, and given continued effective wage
restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he
said.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer its commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative
to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the
alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt
rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country"s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt
certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in
selected industries under the Philippines" debt/equity program.
    Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of
5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to
Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don"t believe that there is going to be a problem on the
accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative
proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government
regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<TITLE>PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks on the possibility of reintroducing
global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    The special meeting of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    However, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.
    Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    Producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of
Costa Rica said.
    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
September 30, delegates said.
    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    But consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and
Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even
adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.
    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,
they said.

<TITLE>BRITISH CONSERVATIVES AHEAD OF LABOUR IN NEW POLLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain"s ruling Conservatives have
enlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party, according
to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.
    A Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) poll
conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a
six point lead, while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for
The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead.
    The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the
Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in
a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of
Greenwich, near London.
    The MORI poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the
by-election, showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote,
Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and
Liberals with 21 pct.
    The Sunday Express said its poll, conducted on Friday,
found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, Labour
with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct.
    A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last
Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over
Labour. In that survey, the Conservatives had the support of 39
pct of the voters, Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain," the report says.
    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels."
    Constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    The government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked
for such a meeting."
    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister
said.
    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.
    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international
oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."
    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
April at the request of certain of the body"s members.
    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.
    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We
expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
April." But he expected the situation would later improve.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."
    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"
the report says.
    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s," the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry."
    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture," the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

<TITLE>INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opposition politicians, businessmen
and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget
and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.
    They said the budget failed to provide incentives for
economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.
    But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise
in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where
playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a
vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling
paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier."
    The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly
political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad
for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and
neutral in respect of everything else."
    Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done
little for them.
    Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and
education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current
expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He
told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of
money-losing public sector industries.
    Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but
otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation
policy launched two years ago.
    Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally
unfavourable.
    Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals
for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost
industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real
economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the
1985-90 development plan.
    Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers
of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital
market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove
surtax on corporate income.
    Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell
in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s
proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities
industry.
    The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and
trading was suspended several times.
    Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in
capital gains tax on stock sales.
    Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of
three years without incurring capital gains tax.
    Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the
fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were
taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer its commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative
to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the
alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt
rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the
debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in
selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program.
    Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of
5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to
Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the
accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative
proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government
regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi riyal interbank deposits were
steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market.
    Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions
amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting
the current decline in oil prices.
    Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab
producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC
prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency
meeting of the 13-member organisation.
    A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European
weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.
    Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct
after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.
    One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at
6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.
    The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the
dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.

<TITLE>QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DOHA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf money markets have grown reasonably
well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain
to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf
International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.
    The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf
capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional
investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank
accounts and precious metals.
    "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with
more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the
disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.
    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three
categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.
    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of
short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had
floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.
    "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large
extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.
    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans
and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of
stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock
exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish
exchanges.
    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,
governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital
markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.
    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had
"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital
markets in the region."
    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,
financial awareness among investors is still lacking and
investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack
depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted
investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.
    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some
Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt
financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.
    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation
of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.
    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made
available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been
taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to
own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.
    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth
from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and
the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi
Arabia.
    But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal
denominated bond issued in 1978.
    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading
in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal
exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,
Azzam said.

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the
... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance."
    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market
prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market."
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,
under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,
which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.
    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also
Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the
pricing agreement.
    "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate
the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the
fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.
    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said
in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were
no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.
    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.
    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Coffee Organization
(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued
with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but
delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and
consumers were diminishing by the minute.
    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in
coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without
agreement, delegates said.
    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within
the next six weeks or in September, they said.
    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became
apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the
formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates
said.
    Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices
soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by
nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee
producer and exporter.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

    It said wheat stocks at the end of 1986 were 390,000
tonnes, up from 223,000 at end-1985. It forecast end-1987
stocks at around 290,000 tonnes.
    The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the
U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi
Arabia (5 pct).

<TITLE>ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange
auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since
January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.
    "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the system would be reintroduced after current
talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.
    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
for the government and the private sector, he said.
    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
In January 1987 the government was more than two months in
arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and
the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange
rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the
country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete, open and
frank, a senior Polish banker was quoted as saying.
    Wladyslaw Baka, head of Poland's National Bank, told the
official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step
towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.
    "Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the
talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of
understanding for Poland's difficult economic position," PAP
quoted Baka as saying.
    Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial
obligations to the U.S., "but not in a short time, and not
without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a
cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."
    Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June, after a 36-year
absence, IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on
fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major
report is expected to be issued in Washington soon.
    Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest
repayments and debt principle falling due this year.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's raw sugar output is likely
to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and
below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.
Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.
    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world
markets in late 1986, the report said.
    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar
production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of
1.99 mln.
    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency
in 1984 may have been short-lived.
    The report said, "The government continues to promote
sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification
program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane
producers.
    "However, there are considerable indications that farmers
are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not
as good as that of other crops."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts
in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests
by European farmers, Community officials said.
    The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's
Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has
called for radical changes in the price support system.
    EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food
surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners
and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such
action.
    With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes
of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge
stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days
of open-ended price guarantees must end.
    EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices
paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the
new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC
members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.
    Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled
with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead
to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products.
    A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed
guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be
scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.
    The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on
agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow
two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European
currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected
shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.
    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils
and fats tax and a change in the "green" exchange rate system,
which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.
    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on
imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger
a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides
the EC with the bulk of its soybeans.
    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat
products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter
consumption.
    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which
would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with
weak and strong currencies were brought more into line.

<TITLE>QANTAS TO BUY FOUR 747-400'S FOR ONE BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm
order with Boeing Co &lt;BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost
of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said.
    The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others
arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a
statement.
    The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747
family, he said.
    The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    He said they are United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX> unit &lt;Pratt^M
and Whitney>, General Electric Co &lt;GE> and Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce^M
 Ltd>.
    He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next February. The
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said.
    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.
    The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    The higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.
    They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney
and Los Angeles.

    Analysts said there was speculation that American Express
would sell a stake of Shearson to a Japanese firm and also that
20 pct of the profitable brokerage would be sold to the public.
Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express's 1.25
billion dlrs net in 1986.
    American Express remained silent last Thursday and Friday
as rumours drove its stock up a total of 5.50 dlrs in two days.
It closed Friday at 74.

<TITLE>INDONESIA UNLIKELY TO IMPORT PHILIPPINES COPRA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia is unlikely to import copra
from the Philippines in 1987 after importing 30,000 tonnes in
1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.
    The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian
rupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases in
the price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin between
prices in the two countries.
    Indonesia's copra production is forecast at 1.32 mln tonnes
in calendar 1987, up from 1.30 mln tonnes in 1986.

<TITLE>STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the
Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand
and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas,
officials and seismologists said.
    There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake
jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas.
    The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually
isolated.
    A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which
has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges
in the area had been damaged.
    No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to
hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud
slip.
    Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes,
the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were
followed by a series of aftershocks.
    The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato
regions in the northeast of the North Island.
    Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more
than a week.
    Police said many districts lost power supplies and
telephone links.
    Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water
behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above
Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the
roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina, the
largest earth dam in the North Island.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES HEADS CONFIDENTLY INTO DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin
starts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory
committee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on the
mend and political stability one year after President Corazon
Aquino took power, central bank officials said.
    The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion
dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between
January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on
another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any
new agreement, the officials said.
    Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage
point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and
Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR
portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment
suspension last week, the officials said.
    Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since
1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16
percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a
77 billion dlr rescue.
    Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is
currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.
    The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered
when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.
    Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional
5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.
    One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type
accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing
to endorse five months after it was signed.
    In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs
outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks
on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have
average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

<TITLE>SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
&lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's palm oil output is expected
to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its
annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.
    The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output
is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in
1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln
in 1985.
    The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a
provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.
    A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln
tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.
    "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will
be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said.
    The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export
tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher
international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase
in exports this year.
    Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against
695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa
will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are
forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the
government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.
    The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture
forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60
kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags
produced in 1985/86.
    In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to
5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln
in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.
    The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln
tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a
fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of
quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.
    Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily
as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of
cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985
from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government
to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.
    Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000
tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.
    The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes
this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.
    The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of
Indonesian cocoa beans.
    The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC
(crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase
significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new
CTC processing plants.
    Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing
more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.
    Production of black and green teas is forecast in the
embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from
123,000 tonnes in 1986.
    Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes
in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.
    The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality
controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more
competititve in the world market.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE EXCHANGE SEEKING NASDAQ/LONDON LINK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation System, banking sources said.
    The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York
authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was
very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end
of this month.
    Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters
they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems
on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local
financial support for the plan existed.
    Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the
three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling
a gap when no trading takes place.
    A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start
of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.
    The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed
in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and
transfer information among the different time zones, but some
details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank
director said.
    Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy
sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market
liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
    But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head
start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong,
Toyko and Australia, he said.
    On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ),
modelled on NASDAQ.
    At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one
company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd
(SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small
firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.
    Market sources expect the next few companies listed will
also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem
meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of
Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said.
    SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek
Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr
each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.
    In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial
1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far
more than 900,000 shares have traded.

<TITLE>GERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon," another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up," one banking analyst said.
    "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

<TITLE>JAPAN'S NTT FORECASTS PROFITS FALL IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>
(NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, 1988 from a projected 348 billion this
year, the company said.
    Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to
5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT
said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry.
    NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770
billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and
development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.
    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new
entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a
sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January, were the
major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.
    The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in
1985.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai Airways International plans to
expand its fleet to 58 from 30 aircraft by 1995, company
officials said.
    Thamnoon Wanglee, vice-president for finance, told a
weekend marketing conference Thai would finance the expansion
by borrowing, but he did not give details.
    He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to
36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently
64.3 pct of overall debt.
    He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall
debt in the same period, compared to 15.7 pct now.
    Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no
plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a
government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company,
the state-owned domestic carrier.
    A report presented to the conference showed the airline
expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987
than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales
revenue in the past four months.
    Executive vice president Chatrachai Bunya-ananta said the
current expansion of Bangkok airport would be completed this
year.

<TITLE>IRAQ DEFERS PAYMENTS ON 500 MLN DLR EUROLOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq has secured agreement to defer
outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan
following five months of negotiations with creditor banks.
    Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's
continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its
economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world
oil prices.
    Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last
September it could not meet the remaining four principal
repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of
these for 71.25 mln due on September 29.
    The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of
Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a
five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over
London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some
way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the
first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not
deferred.
    One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of
the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three
more instalments to be made every six months.
    The remaining three principal instalments - originally due
in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be
deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said.
    The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty
interest is being imposed, the sources added.
    Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one
of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for
Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign
debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought
to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies,
particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned
Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr
deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in
October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period.
    The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its
allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing.
    But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of
credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and
western government export credit agencies has been underway.
Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of
obligations due on letters of credit.

<TITLE>JAPAN PLANS MORE FLEXIBLE CORPORATE BOND ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese importers bought some 95,000
tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September
shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources
said.
    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs
from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down
from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.
    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices
in Chicago plus the FOB premium.
    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot
buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986
crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some
300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.
    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to
remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the
sources said.
    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese
edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,
but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of
Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

<TITLE>TRADING DELAYED ON SINGAPORE'S NEW BILL MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The start of trading on the new
Singapore Government Securities Market has been postponed until
late March or early April because legislative amendments still
need parliamentary approval, banking sources said.
    The new bill market, intended to establish a base for a
wider capital market and to encourage private bond issues in
Singapore, was supposed to be launched today.
    William K.K. Wong, managing director of Indosuez Asia
(Singapore) Ltd, said there is no real obstacle to prevent the
new market from taking off. Most dealers are optimistic it will
provide more liquidity for operators to trade, he said.
    Lawrence Yeo, director of Citicorp Investment Bank
(Singapore) Ltd, said the market's success depends on domestic
participation.
    The five primary dealers and the three registered dealers
will all be local companies.
    The primary dealers are &lt;Commercial Discount Co Ltd>,
&lt;National Discount Co Ltd>, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd
&lt;OCBM.SI>, &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd> and United Overseas Bank
Ltd &lt;UOBM.SI>. They will underwrite the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) auctions, maintain market liquidity and channel
open-market operations, MAS said.
    &lt;Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd>, &lt;Indosuez Asia
(Singapore) Ltd> and &lt;Credit Suisse First Boston Asia Ltd> will
be recognised as registered dealers. They will act as market
makers but will not bid directly at auctions.
    MAS plans to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments
grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38
billion dlrs of paper over the first five years.
    Non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to
accept average yield will be allocated first, to a maximum
500,000 dlrs for notes and bonds and to an unlimited amount for
treasury bills.
    The remaining amount will be awarded to competitive bidders
from the lowest yield upwards.
    In the secondary market, the standard lot traded between
dealers will be one mln dlrs worth of treasury bills and
500,000 dlrs worth of government notes and bonds.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
&lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
&lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated
300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy
said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.
    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
yields have remained below target.
    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000
tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000
tonnes in 1985/86.
    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and
890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.
    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
come on stream in early 1988.
    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the
U.S. Provides the rest, it said.
    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since
domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
willing to pay a premium for them," it said.
    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
1986/87 and 1987/88.
    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"
the report said.

    The offer capitalises IC Gas at around one billion stg.
    It said it was tendering for both ordinary stock and loan

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKS COOL ON NIGERIAN DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese banks are expected to give
Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here
tomorrow for talks, banking sources said.
    "We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt
rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese
bank.
    A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese
creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support
for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr
foreign debt, bankers said.
    The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank
creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria
although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept
rescheduling of part of their existing loans.
    "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese
creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the
nation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.
    He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent
of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were
uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.
    Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria,
representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western
commercial institutions, banking sources said.
    They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs
in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5
billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese
banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as
well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day
meeting here, the sources added.
    "Otherwise, our response will be very negative," the senior
official said.
    Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor
banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt
proposal.
    Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial
banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems.
    Barclays Bank plc &lt;BCS.L> has the most exposure to
Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee
looking at the problem, the banking sources said. BankAmerica
Corp &lt;BAC.N> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far
East and representing them on the committee, they added.

    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.61 billion stg.
    Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and
a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360
mln stg respectively. In addition, bankers' balances above
target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today.

<TITLE>JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely
to leave office this summer amid opposition to his
controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
    They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has
suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct
sales tax planned for January 1988.
    "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the
end of his administration, which is not only impossible but
also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori,
professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.
    "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as
parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"
Shiratori said.
    Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of
parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is
needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
    Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP
members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting
because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of
government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is
broken, I would like to see punishment considered."
    "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly
because Nakasone breached his election pledge against
introducing it," Shiratori said.
    "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels
uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's
appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is
rapidly aging," he said.
    Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect
the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,
involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and
assemblies at all levels.
    But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties
excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with
the LDP, the political analysts added.
    Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the
sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for
some time before the government makes a final decision.
    "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to
perhaps three pct.
    "A third alternative for the government is to ram through
the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said.
    Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University,
thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone
will take a vote on the tax bills," he said.
    The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and
143 in the 252-seat Upper House.
    To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP
pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to
resign, Sato said.
    "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to
return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said.

<TITLE>BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOWETO, South Africa, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of black
mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize
control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal
mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant
black workers.
    About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves
proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).
    They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the
end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.
    Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more
than half of the labour force in the mines.
    It was not stated how the union would "seize control."
    The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of
single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by
housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.
    The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since
South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also
shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with
anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front
(UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their
support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela be released.

    It said the quota allocation was based on a national

from 3.05 mln in mid-January.

<TITLE>ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rajan Moses, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mine and industry officials from
most member states of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group
exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according
to views polled by Reuter correspondents.
    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at
cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and
boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.
    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account
for some 65 pct of the world's tin output.
    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export
quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,
Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.
    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.
However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly
equal to its expected output this year.
    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.
    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,
said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that
output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started
March 1.
    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that
excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in
the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.
    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb
and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More
than 100 applications for licences are pending.
    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining
licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed
that local mines were not overproducing.
    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister
Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.
    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT
Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to
stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was
close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.
    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said
Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this
would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.
    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin
exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage
bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be
permitted, he said.
    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to
disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive
production, industry sources said.
    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told
Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,
Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.
    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in
1985, Pramual said.
    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than
its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.
    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz
that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in
calendar 1987.
    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of
October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state
mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of
Bolivia's total exports.
    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports
but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be
achieved. He did not elaborate.
    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in
Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its
ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had
declined due to poor demand and high production costs.
    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was
less than 1,000 tonnes last year.
    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'
export figures every three months using customs documents and
make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to
be breached within the year-long quota period.
    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to
breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.
    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil
their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other
members at the ATPC's discretion.
    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated
106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.
    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with
the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes
respectively during the quota period.

<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea plans to take steps to keep
its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs,
Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead
of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and
investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from
rising too quickly.
    Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65
billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484
mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in
January 1986, Bank of Korea figures show.

<TITLE>SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rosario Liquicia, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Disagreement over management of &lt;San
Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's
appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment
analysts said.
    They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut Planters
Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean
changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by
the family of its president, Andres Soriano.
    Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls
51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned.
    The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds
six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln
sequestered shares.
    The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by
Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was
a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he
left the country after Marcos's fall.
    Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for
the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.
    The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded
at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday
that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the
objections of some directors associated with Soriano.
    "I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such," he
said.
    "I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where
you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has
assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a
contentious manner," Ongpin added.
    The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing
Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that
a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit
and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a
clear conflict.
    UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy's
appointment, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of the
owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."
    Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a
right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers
who claim ownership of the disputed shares.
    The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would
probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to
resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government
officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual
election is scheduled for May.
    A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to
the PCGG to decide whom to appoint.
    One analyst said objections were understandable from the
family that founded the company 97 years ago.
    "It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,"
he said.
    SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net
sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales
of 10.36 billion.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The combined profits of Japan's major
corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to
fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to
the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research
Institute of Economics said.
    The private research body also said in a statement that 437
of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year
against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.
    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on
sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.
    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries
to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten
their business outlook, the institute said.
    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce
corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved
performance outlook.
    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will
be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction
businesses, it said.
    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates
of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.

<TITLE>INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal
1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit
will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the
country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty,
economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.
    The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is
56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of
a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.
    The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on
wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.
    Economists pointed out that the government itself had
expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87
economic survey report published last week.
    Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime
Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to
trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for
1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he
said.
    But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously.
They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an
initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.
    Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific
measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.
    Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as
reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may
cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by
15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of
1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86
period.
    Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects,
after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.
    Economists said the deficit would also cause the government
to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and
bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up
from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.
    No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes,
which will discourage savings, economists said.
    Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union
Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to
around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency
notes to cover the deficit.
    Brokers said stock market investors have started selling
long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the
budget that reduces the holding period required to claim
exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.
    Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertainty
in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure."
    But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic
selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the
scene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," he
said.
    Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help
small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the
capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market
on a long-term basis.
    New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and
non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion
rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion
in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan decided at a policy
board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said the broad
measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally
adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December.
    The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1
pct in the year to December.
    The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a
seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a
non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said.
    The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two
weks ago.
    In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and
by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year.
    The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a
non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also
confirmed provisional figures issued in February.
    The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct
in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the
Bank said.
    The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth
in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg.
    Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)
showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank
private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1
billion stg.
    There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in
January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing
sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest
bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

<TITLE>EXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Mar 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of
British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it had
agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings
Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs.
    Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was
being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently
holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.
    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct
each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.
    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the
largest U.S. Government securities brokers.
    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other
instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.
    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
Government securities broker for the past four years and had
made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp
&lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.
    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be
bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net
income of around 16 mln dlrs.
    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of
brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.
    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in
the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which
provided computer software for the financial services
community.
    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market
turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a
day, and in London where it has 15 billion.
    It was also given permission last week to open an office in
Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about
five billion dlrs a day.
    The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of
B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Lewis, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to embark on a new series of
austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled
last year after quadrupling in 1985.
    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by
Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.
    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget
financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as
too high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.
    "All the organizations of economic management have been
charged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.
    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "The
Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,
and of course the Fund would support these efforts."
    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.
    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state
budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last
year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.
    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints
because of poor performance by state firms, which needed
subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.
    The exact extent and nature of savings are still under
discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest
budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.
    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low
consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164
billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.
Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.
    "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the
former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"
Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If we
are not hard then we will not be successful."
    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve
provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and
800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believe
these reserves should not be used at all," he said.
    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic
product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.
    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real
wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax
penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.
    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail
price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.
    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.
    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and
33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.
    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant
cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made
this difficult.
    But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to make
curtailments in subsidies in this area as well."
    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the
beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and
value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.
    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an
attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.
    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be
unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is
being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.
    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state
by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to
shed labour. He gave no exact figures.
    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible
for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped
the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.
    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single
budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved
for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).
    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to
more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven
billion in 1986, Boesze said.
    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year
to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while
trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more
than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years
earlier.
    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct
by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10
pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.
    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian
economists in a speech this month that the country's economy
was in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.
    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results
this year, however, and borrowing must be used more
effectively.
    "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,"
Berecz said.

<TITLE>DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Leach, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 2  - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's strong economic revival has led
some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some
quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian
experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.
    "I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian
miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always
oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and
unwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy's
leading economists and a professor at Rome University.
    According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have
been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute
seen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar and
the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,
    "I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be
the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign
newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another
story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark
room."
    Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists
here, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the
dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial
enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.
     Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,
&lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the
major state industries are back in the black after years of
losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of
payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some
experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's
fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.
    Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it
feels to be its second-rate status among the major
industrialised countries.
    Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this
status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers
from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.
    Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an
agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada
attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned
managing the international monetary system.
    But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems
still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.
    "We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,"
warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.
    He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed
cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on
the problems still remaining rather than those already solved.
    The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment
and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most
worrying problems, experts say.
    The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at
109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion
lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral
again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss
university in Rome.
    Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a
decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running
at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee
international competiveness, economists and industrialists say.
    And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last
October according to the latest official data.
    Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million
people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged
between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at
17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product
(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct
in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to
check rising unemployment.
    Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw
materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.
    This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last
year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade
deficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion
lire in 1985.
    But economists say the improvement owes little to any
structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal
of the trend in costs could have serious consequences.
    If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top
industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket
operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality
information about their activities, economists say.
    Italy has no controls on insider trading.
    The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements
controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to
be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less
blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating
procedures, economists say.
    "Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I
doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks
which would allow me to do that," says Spaventa.

<TITLE>JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
growing increasingly irritated with each other.
    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese
government official said. "But we are also frustrated."
    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
but it will, he said.
    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
remain when it talks with Congress.
    "It would only take five minutes to list their
accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.
    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
    On the following two days, the topics will range from
multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
problems as super computers.
    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
buying more imports.
    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one
Japanese official said.
    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
action by the U.S., Officials said.
    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
overhanging them.
    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.
    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
super computers.
    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
super computer market.
    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
public institutions like universities which buy the
sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up
informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential
sellers, officials said.

    The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others
arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a
statement.
    The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747
family, he said.
    The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    He said they are &lt;Pratt and Whitney> and General Electric
Co &lt;GE>, a unit of United Technologies Corp &lt;UTX>, and
Britain's &lt;Rolls-Royce Ltd>.
    He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next February. The
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said.
    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.
    The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    The higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.
    They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney
and Los Angeles.

<TITLE>EC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission said
it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union
is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.
    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from
EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet
mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the
European industry.
    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC
had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between
August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of
the EC market if they continue at the same pace.
    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than
40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to
cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The
imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.
    The Commission said the industry would probably be unable
to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would
result in loss of sales and jobs.
    The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the
Commission will allow all interested parties to state their
cases to the authority.

<TITLE>MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will offer commercial
bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt
payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash,
the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that
the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when
debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
    He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful
alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that
they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the
Philippines to say exactly the same thing."
    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the
country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the
debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.
    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon
bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a
considerable discount from their redemption price.
    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a
guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no
payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.
    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond
market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.
    The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries
under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila
is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points
over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring
3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.
    "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or
the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone
to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World)
Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury
to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has
generally been positively received."
    "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on
the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this
alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the
government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."

<TITLE>ARGENTINE DEBT NEGOTIATOR CONFIDENT OF ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's chief debt negotiator
said he was confident of a prompt accord with international
creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt.
    "I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and
quick negotiation," Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on
return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world
financial officials.
    Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering
committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet
four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for
a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit.
    Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but
Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments
on its foreign debt.
    He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to
meet the targets, adding that the banks' attitude had improved
following Brazil's decision.
    The United States and a group of other industrial nations
on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.
    Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus.

<TITLE>MANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A rift has occured among Philippine
officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief
negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.
    Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had
decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to
fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion
dlrs.
    "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as
possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said.
    Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6
billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8
billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource
transfer in the same period.
    Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over
the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    Monsod said,  "Right now we are saying to the banks, let's
share the financing burden."
    Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth
facility to bridge the funding gap.
     He said the government and the consultative group would
meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid
donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to
finance any gap on a shared basis.
    He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to
pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.
    Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics.
"Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talks
and I listen but I don't necessarily agree."
    Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging
the financing gap would have aided the government's
pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.
    She said if private sector investment continued to be held
back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising
interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross
national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over
the next six years.
    "If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan.
How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said,
adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.
    "It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult
for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.
    "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going
to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not
be able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said.
    Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressed
Manila's policy was growth before debt.
    She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the
Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing
all debt repayments.
    "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of
the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have
an option," Monsod said. "You just don't send it abroad. You do a
Brazil."

<TITLE>TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
A senior economic planner said.
    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially," he said.
    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
among the island's main export-earners.
    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
more generous terms.

Rhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with
a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment
certificates on March 9.
    Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of
the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will
be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6.
    The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date,
said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue
its development strategy and make further acquisitions.
    Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the
Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The
group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs.
    Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give
details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987.
    He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial
investment program of around five billion francs, and research
spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5
billion francs on acquisitions last year.
    "Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that
must be seized," Fourtou said.

<TITLE>HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>
expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not make any specific projections for the company's
earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
split.
    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
remaining shares.
    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
export-led growth.
    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
the British colony.
    He said all of the company's major operations showed
improved results in 1986.
    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
&lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
Hongkong Electric.
    Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
the government for the spin-off.
    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.
Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property
development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO> of Canada
and Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L> of Britain.

<TITLE>BALLADUR EXPECTS IMPROVED FEBRUARY INFLATION DATA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French inflation rate is expected to
show a substantial improvement in February after January's very
high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said.
    He told a French television interviewer that half of the
high January rise, which took year on year inflation that month
to three pct, was due to higher oil prices.
    "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast
for price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said.
    Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target,
which the government had initially set at two pct for this
year, should not affect wage expectations for this year.
    "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy,"
he said, referring to the government's aim of holding public
sector wage increases to three pct this year.
    Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in
1985.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy continued to expand in
February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    However, production remained vigorous as more than three
times as many members reported it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X>
gradually resumed production.
    An equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August
1984.
    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher
rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc &lt;PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil would not have suspended
payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more
and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    He said he would not seek more money from the International
Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and
said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.
    "It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't
finance a little bit more quickly and easily," Funaro told
reporters at the Brazilian Embassy.
    Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of
monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if
official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,
"Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these
agencies."
    Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro
said "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to
receive from the other side."
    Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,
stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments
on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World
Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the
past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.
    He said the net transfer was hurting the country's
continued growth and capacity to import goods.
    "Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to
be found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said.
    He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he
would like to see "automatic" official lending when needed so
that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,
now reported to be below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade
surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight
billion dlrs.
    But he said that without increased and faster lending from
official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export
earnings to finance development and imports and also service
its debt.
    "We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and
internal adjustment," Funaro said.
    He complained that official lending agencies had imposed
tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving
commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.
    Funaro said U.S officials understand his position "but they
don't like it." Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe
and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany,
France, Switzerland and Italy.
    Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent
a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over
Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of
short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

<TITLE>SWISS HAVE NET GAIN IN 1985 GOVERNMENT FINANCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland recorded last year its first
overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with
a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry
said.
    The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term
investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion
francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986
budget.
    All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and
expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.
    The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18
billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61
billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.
    Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985
figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71
billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling
1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985
deficit of 696 mln.
    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above
forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected
receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.
    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than
planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.
    The ministry said the improvement in the overall account
reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to
introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax
increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of
inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil
prices were also important factors.
    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used
its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs
of government debt, which accounted for the difference between
the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln
franc overall surplus.

<TITLE>APPLE COMPUTER &lt;AAPL> UPGRADES MACINTOSH LINE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dean Lokken</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Apple Computer Inc today will
announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable
Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the
business market.
    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has
been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new
machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster
and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than
earlier models.
    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple
says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,
goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging
from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.
    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than
the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced
between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.
    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for
about 2,200 dlrs.
    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld
Conference in Los Angeles.
    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers
at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance
Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the
expanding market for science and engineering workstations.
    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE
should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this
year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.
    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for
most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real
power product for revenue."
    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers
but expected the new products to do well.
    "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of
computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"
he told Reuters. "The graphics interface on the Mac products is
significantly better than anything IBM has to date."
    International Business Machines is expected to announce
updated personal computers this spring.
    The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an
"open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerous
peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of
memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with
a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.
    In a demonstration of its speed and power, company
executives said they thought the Mac II would push the
development of software for Apple computers in new directions
that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail
systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.
    The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256
colors or shades of gray.
    The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and
will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four
megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.
    Both new computers have two optional keyboards, a new
feature in the Apple line of products.

    After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New

<TITLE>LL/E ROYALTY &lt;LRT> REVENUES MAY BE ESCROWED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co &lt;LLX>, the working interest owner for
its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start
placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue
to the trust.
    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any
amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the
necessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interest
owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties
paid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from the
properties are the trust's only source of income.
    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary
annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted
present value of future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the
trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively
from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural
gas prices.
    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have
actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates
reflect prices and costs only through September 30.
    The trust said using the September figures, the engineers
determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from
total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices
received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would
have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has
been some weakening in prices since January.
    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in
estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama
and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,
as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production
costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

<TITLE>PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

<DATELINE>    KARACHI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan cotton production during the
current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375
pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman
of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.
    Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln
bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June
after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.
    They said consumption would increase due to a rise in
demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan
produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and
exported 157 mln.
    The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to
export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year
compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.
    The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton
carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales
last year.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said
it is forming a new U.S. pharmaceuticals unit called ICI
Pharma.
    Combined sales of Imperial's existing Stuart
Pharmaceuticals unit and the new ICI Pharma are projected to be
1.1 billion dlrs in 1990, the company said.  Stuart had 1986
sales of 582 mln dlrs.
    Imperial said it plans to introduce several new drugs,
including diprivan, an anaesthetic, and zestril, a heart drug,
over the next three years. ICI Pharma and Stuart will operate
as separate units of ICI Pharmaceuticals Group, it said.
    Stuart Pharmaceuticals and ICI Pharma will have 1987 sales
of approximately 700 mln dlrs, about 450 mln dlrs from the new
ICI Pharma and 250 mln dlrs from Stuart, officials said.
    The combined sales force of about 900 sales people, split
about equally between the two units, will be slightly larger
than the existing sales force at Stuart.
    Regulatory approval for the annesthetic diprivan is
expected in late 1987, while zestril, a hypertension and heart
drug, should be approved in mid or late 1988, company officials
said.
    Approval for oth new drugs, including, statil, a treatment
for diabetic complications, is not expected until 1989 and
1990, the officials said.

    A spokesman said Alcan was closing the smelter, with annual
capacity of 44,000 tonnes and 320 employees, because of high
electricity costs and the low world market price of aluminium.
    Alkan had said earlier this year it would close half the
plant's capacity but decided to shut down completely when talks
with potential cooperation partners failed, the spokesman said.
He declined to name the other companies involved in the talks.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal," one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Szekely</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After a week that left his presidency
shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his
new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an
administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.
    Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,
whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan
praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing
criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with
Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.
    Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is
assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has
done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey
as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
    White House officials are checking to see how much support
Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have
if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.
    Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," the
Kansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in some
difficulty."
    Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority
by Baker.
    Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale
scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates
nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only
after months of congressional probes into the affair.
    "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen.
and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim."
    Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week With
David Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is in
trouble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said
the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.
    When asked on the syndicated television program, "John
McLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed,
the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it.
    "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicates
that the National Security Council had policy-type influence
over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into
that with Mr. Gates.
    Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report
prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief
of staff.
    Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury
secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past
two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the
botched handling of the Iran arms sale.
    The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the
White House" since it was first revealed last November that
profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra
rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
    The two other victims of the scandal are former National
Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was
disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale
were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower
commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have
refused to testify.
    Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed
in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose
inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
    That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and
threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves
office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found
that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,
a record low, and a third believed he should consider
resignation.
    After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over
the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.
John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television
address this week to respond to the criticisms of his
presidency.

<TITLE>CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK>
is expecting strong results this year after reporting better
than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told
reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19
cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a
four-for-one stock split.
    The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15
cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus
issue.
    Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in
1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion
dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln
dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel
to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion
dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local
property market and substantial increases in contributions from
associated companies.
    "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for
the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's)
exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial
buildings."
    Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in
the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a
land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is
exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a
second airport.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Viacom International Inc said it
received revised merger offers from &lt;National Amusements Inc>
and &lt;MCV Holdings Inc>.
    The company said the special committee plans to meet later
today to review both offers.
    Viacom said National Amusements' Arsenal Holdings Inc
raised the value of its offer for the Viacom shares not held by
National Amusements in three areas. National Amusements holds
19.6 pct of Viacom's stock.
    The cash value of the offer was raised to 42.00 dlrs from
the 40.50 dlrs a Viacom share offered February 23 while the
value of the fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred
being offered was increased to 7.50 dlrs a share from six dlrs.
The interest rate to be used to increase the cash value of the
merger, if delayed beyond April 30, was raised to nine pct from
eight pct and 12 pct after May 31.
    A Viacom spokesman said the Arsenal Holdings's offer
continues to include a 20 pct interest in Arsenal for present
Viacom shareholders.
    Viacom said MCV Holdings, a group which includes the
company's senior management and the Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States, raised the value of its offer by
increasing the value of the preferred being offered to 8.50
dlrs from 8.00 dlrs a share and raising the ownership in the
new company to be held by present Viacom shareholders to 45 pct
from 25 pct. MCV called its previous offer, made February 26,
the "final" proposed revision of its agreement with Viacom.

members have struck the news staffs of CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and
Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB> this morning after negotiations
for a new contract broke down.
    The guild said there had been extensions prior to the
strike deadline this morning, but said the strike was called
after the companies refused to negotiate.
    The guild said the companies failed to put a final offer on
the table, made no money offer at all, and did not deviate
substantially from their original proposals, which, the guild
said, would have gutted the union contract.
    The guild said the networks demanded the right to terminate
employees at will and lay them off without the  arbitration,
and the hiring of temporary employees to replace staffer
employees.
    The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants,
researchers, production assistants, promotion writers and
graphic artists.
    The strike affects unions in New York, Chicago, Washington
and Los Angeles. Picketing will commence at corporate
headquarters in New York and other locations, the guild said.

<TITLE>MILLER TABAK HAS 91.8 PCT OF PENN TRAFFIC &lt;PNF></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Miller Tabak Hirsch and Co> said it
has received an accepted 3,424,729 common shares of Penn
Traffic Co in response to its 31.60 dlr per share tender offer
that expired Friday, and together with the 380,728 shares it
already owned, it now has about 91.8 pct of Penn Traffic.
    The company said Penn Traffic is expected to hold a special
shareholders' meeting later this month to approve a merger into
Miller Tabak at the tender price.
    It said two Miller Tabak representatives will be named to
the Penn Traffic board on March Four to serve as the only

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee quota talks at the International
Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this
afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached
common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export
quotas, delegates said.
    The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian
proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used
historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to
discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they
said.
    Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for
agreement at this time.
    "Anything could happen," one delegate said.

<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pittston Co said it has
tentatively agreed to acquire WTC International N.V. in a
tax-free exchange of stock.
    Pittston said it agreed to exchange 0.523 common share for
each of the about 8,612,000 WTC common shares outstanding.
    Pittston said WTC's three principal shareholders, who own
62 pct of its stock, are parties to this agreement. They have
granted Pittston the right of first refusal to their shares.
    WTC has granted Pittston an option to buy WTC shares equal
to 18.5 poct of its outstanding stock. The agreement is subject
to approval of both boards and WTC shareholders.
    Pittston said described WTC as a fast growing air freight
forwarding company with operations throughout the world. Its
revenues totaled nearly 200 mln dlrs in the year ended November
30 and for the quarter ended on that date it earned 1.3 mln
dlrs on revenues of 55.8 mln dlrs.
    Pittston said its Burlington Air Express subsidiary
generates about two-thirds of its 450 mln dlrs in annual
revenes with its domestic air freight services.

borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use
them at 1430 GMT.
    The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg
assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so
far today to 493 mln stg. This compares with its forecast of a
shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg.
    The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising
41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at
10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct.
    Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently
used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does
not want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates.
    The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at
rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market
dealing rates.

USDA LIFTS CROSS-COMPLIANCE FOR 1987 CROP OATS
    REPEAT FROM LATE FRIDAY
    WASHINGTON, Feb 27 - The USDA said it is lifting the
limited cross-compliance requirement for 1987 crop oats.
    Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said the action was being
taken to help alleviate the short supply of oats.
    Under limited cross compliance, the plantings of other
program crops on the farm may not exceed the crop acreage bases
of those crops.
    The lifting of the cross-compliance on oats permits the
planting of oats in excess of the oat acreage base without
sacrificing eligibility for other crop program benefits.
    Myers said soybean plantings are expected to decrease as a
result of the action on oats, planting of which are expected to
increase by two to three mln acres.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in
Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and
Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems
with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only
partial servicing of the debt.
    "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance
for part of the service, because we cannot service all that," he
said. "I really think we have to change the old rules."
    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather
than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a
solution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to the
governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the
banks have some limits."
    "It is a political discussion from our point of view," he
said.
    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to
Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk
to the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from the
governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He was
not sure how long it would take to reach a solution.
 &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the
mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in
need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually
closed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.
    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by
Brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood
Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.
    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "because
we can't stay as we were the last few years."
    "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us
would like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. Although
Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call
in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to
World Bank President Barber Conable.
    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to
decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight
billion dlr trade surplus in 1987.
    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had
declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last
year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.
    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,
Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only
one pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," he
said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and
inducing an internal recession in order to service debt.
    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,

Mapinduzi (CCM) party has endorsed the government's economic
reform programme but said it did not think more changes, such
as a further devaluation of the shilling, would be needed.
    Tanzania has devalued the shilling more than 65 pct in less
than a year and has started to overhaul inefficient government
firms in line with a package agreed with the IMF.
    The CCM's national executive committee said it was
satisfied with government efforts to implement IMF conditions.
"Measures taken so far are satisfactory and there is no need to
take other ones -- the devaluation of the shilling included," it
said.
    The committee's statement was in response to a government
report on the IMF package submitted last Thursday.

Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the
growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign
Trade official said.
    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile
export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,
based on the value of 1985 exports.
    The official said the pact was unfair because the United
States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and
South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until
1991.
    He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its
two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of
the surging value of the Taiwan dollar.

<TITLE>CONSOLIDATED TVX TO BUY BRAZIL GOLD MINE STAKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Consolidated TVX Mining Corp> said it
agreed to issue 7.8 mln treasury shares to acquire interests in
three gold mining companies in Brazil and an option to increase
the company's interest in a platinum property.
    The company said the transactions will bring immediate
production and earnings to Consolidated TVX, enhance its
precious metal potential and is expected to improve cash flow
and earnings on a per share basis. The company did not give
specific figures.
    Consolidated TVX said it will acquire 29 pct of CMP, a
public gold mining company in which TVX already holds a 15 pct
interest, making TVX the largest single shareholder.
    The company also agreed to acquire a 19 pct stake in Novo
Astro, a private company, and a 16 pct interest in Teles Pires
Mining, increasing the TVX's ownership to 51 pct.
    In addition, Consolidated TVX said it will acquire the
right to add a 10 pct interest to a platinum property in which
it already owns a 29.4 pct stake.
    CMP earned 11 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986 and expects to
produce 42,000 ounces of gold in 1987 at a cost of 160 U.S.
dlrs an ounce, Consolidated TVX said.
    Novo Astro operates Brazil's richest gold mine located in
Amapa State, with an average grade of 0.8 ounces of gold a ton
in a hardrock quartz vein, Consolidated TVX said. Mining of
eluvial surface material produced 25,000 ounces in 1986 and is
expected to produce 60,000 ounces in 1987.
    It also said Teles Pires Mining controls rights to a 350
kilometer section of the Teles Pires River, where one dredge is
expected to produce 10,000 ounces of gold in 1987.

<TITLE>NUCLEAR DATA &lt;NDI> GETS EXTENSIONS ON LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nuclear Data Inc said its bank lenders
agreed to extend its secured loan agreement through June 30,
1987.
    The agreement, which covers about 9.5 mln dlrs in short
term debt, had been scheduled to expire February 28.
    Terms of the extension require Nuclear Data to obtain
replacement financing from outside sources before June 30, it
said.
    If the company is unable to or fails to achieve certain
projected operating results in the meantime, it will be
required to divest enough assets to retire its debt, it said.
    For the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended
November 30, 1986, Nuclear Data reported a loss of almost nine
mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs.
    Nuclear Data cited improvement in printed circuit board
sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement
financing.
    In other action, Nuclear Data said it set up a 1.25 mln
dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic
medical inventory and the redirection of its U.S. medical sales
efforts.
    The reserve was taken to offset a decline in the U.S.
dollar against the Danish Kroner and other factors adversely
affecting sales of its Danish manufactured medical products in
the U.S. market, Nuclear Data said.

<TITLE>U.K. SAYS HAS NO ROLE IN BRAZIL MORATORIUM TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that
negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter
for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks
this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities
to be able to present a convincing economic program to the
country's creditors. He added an accord with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.
    Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a
clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official
cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.
    Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco
Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an
attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite
suspension of interest payments earlier this month.
    Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the
IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity
program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption
would lead to recession and threaten democracy.
    Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of
their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts
to change the means by which developing countries finance
growth.
    Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not
have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and
faster financing from international agencies.
    He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching
governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves
about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have
some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of
view."
    Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials
had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve
Brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial
contact.
    He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had
been at Funaro's request.
    After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland
and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week
before starting negotiations with banks.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Union of Mineworkers,
NUM, said it will demand a 55 pct annual wage increase in
upcoming negotiations with South Africa's mining companies.
    The union, representing some 360,000 black workers at about
118 mines, last year sought a 45 pct boost in salaries and
settled for 23.5 pct.
    NUM General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa told a news
conference the miners were "very angry at low wages...And are
prepared to press their struggle for as long as it takes to get
their demands met."
    Salaries for black miners currently range from a low of 195
rand or 94 dlrs a month to 800 rand, or 384 dlrs, with an
average monthly wage of 345 rand or 165 dlrs, Ramaphosa said.
    He also said the union has asked the mining companies to
begin new contract talks on April one instead of the usual May
one starting time. The current one-year contract expires at the
end of June.

reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of
customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves
directly instead via System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at

under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year
notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study group said the United States
should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln
barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact
of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private
group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
development techniques.
    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a
barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with
imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves
and more exploration and development research would help to
guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

plans to build 485,000 cars in the April-June period, compared
with 497,000 a year ago.
    Ford's new production schedule represents a 12 pct increase
from previous production plans for cars and 10 pct for trucks,
Ward's said.

<TITLE>REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM &lt;VIA> OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>French operators last Friday requested
licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
French trade sources said.
    The latest requests for the maize were for export to
Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
Ecu daily rebate.
    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
dispute over grain sales to Spain.
    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
context to 25,500 tonnes.
    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an
unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

<TITLE>STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study group said the United States
should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln
barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact
of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private
group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
development techniques.
    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a
barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with
imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.
    The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to
protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such
device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.
    But the group did not strongly back either option, saying
there were benefits and drawbacks to both.
    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves
and more exploration and development research would help to
guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Carbide Corp is looking to
acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and
plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of
Chemicals and Plastics.
    Describing this as a major departure in the company's
approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We
are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
markets we've identified."
    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if
we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger
explained.
    He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable
market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
up profitably with someone who is already there."
    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
same way.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp's GMAC Financial
Services said it plans to offer 25 billion dlrs in pre-approved
credit to more than two mln "preferred customers" in a
nationwide direct mail campaign.
    The GM unit said the program is the largest automotive
credit offer of its kind in history.
    GMAC Financial Services said the mailing will be completed
by early March. Selected current GMAC customers will receive
offers of pre-approved credit equal to the cash selling price
of the vehicles they are currently financing, rounded up to the
next 1,000 dlrs.
    Within this group, Buick owners will also receive a special
discount of 300 dlrs that would be provided by GM's Buick motor
division if they accept GMAC's offer to finance or lease a new
Buick.

<TITLE>CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government is expected
to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn
exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.
government and farm group representatives said.
    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.
    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,
Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the
Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn
exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.
    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn
imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to 
corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch port and transport union, FNV,
agreed to an employers' request to reconvene abandoned peace
talks tonight to try to end strikes that have disrupted
Rotterdam's general cargo sector for the past six weeks, a
union spokesman said.
    Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after
employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which
started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800
from the sector's 4,000 workforce, starting with 350 this year.
    The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the
day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf
for a resolution of the dispute expires.
    De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he
would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the
sector.
    No comment was immediately available from the employers'
organization.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community steelmakers
presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan
for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be
forced reluctantly to accept.
    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to
restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for
years to come while steel firms undertook a massive
slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.
    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the
ending of the quota system by December 1988.
    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC
law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."
    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this
idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in
their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to
alternative products and accounts firmly in the red.
    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are
likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the
industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the
political impact of plant closures, they said.
    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the
EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota
production system at least until the end of 1990.
    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it
identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to
reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.
    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that
of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.
    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the
Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program,
particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.
    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this
decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange said its ruling
council has decided to close the trading floor for government
bonds (gilts) and equities in due course because most of the
business is now done between brokers' offices.
    A trading floor for traded options will be retained.
    Dwindling activity on the exchange floor reflects the
introduction of the new dealing system, known as SEAQ, which
was part of the Big Bang restructuring of the market last
October. Since then, brokers and market-makers have been
dealing on the basis of competing share quotes displayed on
screens.

<TITLE>CME PLANS RULE CHANGES TIGHTENING S/P TRADING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition
asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading
activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock
Index futures pit, an exchange executive said.
    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal
practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade
for their own account.
    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an
opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called
"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account
before executing orders for their customers.
    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule
on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P
Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures
trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to
submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.
    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed
said the special committee will also make suggestions about a
possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P
500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would
alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.
    Melamed said directors are likely to approve the
recommendations of the special committee because "most actions
of the board are in line with committee recommendations."
    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board
accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be
submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
approval.
    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,
a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership
for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.
    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on
before the recommendations from the special committee are made
"it will confuse the issue."
    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict
dual trading.
    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most
exchanges.
    "It's a question of the integrity of the person you do
business with," Wolff said.
    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that
trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up
for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in
chaotic futures trading pits.
    "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult
for a broker to function because of his errors," said John
Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.
    "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"
he said.
    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage
makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.
    "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or
even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael
said.
    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for
instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day
at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  Even figuring
what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such
brokerage can be lucrative.
    Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of
an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the
brokerage business, Michael said.

Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the
portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58
dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu.
    The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in
the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this
reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.

<TITLE>INVESTOR GROUP HAS TALKS WITH PESCH ON AMI &lt;AMI></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment
firm with a 5.5 pct stake in American Medical International
Inc, said it has had talks with Pesch and Co, which is seeking
control of the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living
in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of
joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.
    WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control
of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.
    WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management,
Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern
controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI
shareholders.
    It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues --
selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try
-- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did
not produce any agreements or understandings.
    WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of
AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate
at this time."
    WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said
it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch
and other shareholders.
    Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22
dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based
on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share
bid, which the company rejected.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks at the extended special meeting of
the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the
reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of
success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.
    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian
proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,
with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new
quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop
year, they said.
    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a
quota agreement varied widely.
    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly
more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of
its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks
likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.
    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had
been tabled formally today, delegates said.
    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a
progress report, delegates said.

<TITLE>SEC STAFF ADVISES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST WPPSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The staff of the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the
Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with
securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on
2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters.
    WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by
SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be
asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official
statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear
power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was
selling the bonds.
    English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff
planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for
power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants,
which were to built with the bonds' proceeds.
    English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no
public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond
sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.
    "We at all times told the public everything we knew about
the costs," he said.
    English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC might
meet on the staff's recommendations.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, never comments on its
enforcement activities.
    The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the
agency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on
several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC's
budget and operations.
    Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS,
one has been completed, two remain under construction, and two
others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have
been terminated.

recently acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd in preparation
for the companies' merger this summer.
    Pacific Western said it appointed president and chief

was previously president of Pacific Western's airline unit,
Pacific Western Airlines Ltd.
    Pacific Western acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines for 300

    Canadian Pacific Air Lines said president and chief
executive Donald Carty and four senior vice-presidents resigned
last week. Carty said in a company memorandum that he accepted
another senior post in commercial aviation and that some of the
vice-presidents were taking early retirment and others were
resigning for personal reasons.
    Pacific Western said the new management structure "will
facilitate our objective of proceeding quickly to successfully
position ourselves in the marketplace as a single airline
network beginning this summer."

<TITLE>AIBD, CEDEL, EUROCLEAR JOIN IN TRADE MATCH SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of International Bond
Dealers, AIBD, said it will cooperate with major clearing
agencies Cedel and Euroclear on a eurobond trade confirmation
and matching system to come into force by September this year.
    The system, designed to give market participants a fast and
reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will
initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.
    It will include recording additional trade data, checking,
comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply
initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.
    The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for
developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems
when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and
confirmation systems by September this year.
    Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one"
matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered
by 1000 London time, designed to work with a planned AIBD rule
requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.
    The confirmation system covering critical trade data is
designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and
also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.

<TITLE>IRISH OIL CONCERN HAS 8.5 PCT OF CYNERGY &lt;CRG></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bryson Oil and Gas Plc, a Belfast,
Northern Ireland, oil company, said it has acquired an 8.5 pct
stake in Cynergy Corp and took steps to help it consider the
possibility of seeking control or influencing the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
which it disclosed its stake, Bryson said it also asked Cynergy
for a list shareholder list in case it decided to communicate
with the holders.
    Shareholder information would be vital to anyone planning a
tender offer and is commonly requested by individuals or groups
mulling takeover attempts.
    Bryson told the SEC it may review the feasibility of trying
to influence the management policies of Cynergy, or of trying
to gain control of the company through representation on its
board of directors.
    A shareholder list would also be necessary for a group
trying to mount a campaign for the election of directors.

<TITLE>AIBD, CEDEL, EUROCLEAR JOIN IN TRADE MATCH SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of International Bond
Dealers, AIBD, said it will cooperate with major clearing
agencies Cedel and Euroclear on a eurobond trade confirmation
and matching system to come into force by September this year.
    The system, designed to give market participants a fast and
reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will
initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.
    It will include recording additional trade data, checking,
comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply
initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.
    The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for
developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems
when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and
confirmation systems by September this year.
    Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one"
matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered
by 1000 London time, designed to work with a planned AIBD rule
requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.
    The confirmation system covering critical trade data is
designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and
also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.

<TITLE>OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OIL MARKET BEING MANIPULATED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KINGSTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused
"oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks and
spreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its
15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.
    Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the
18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.
    "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC
by drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this is
having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the
market which we know is not real," Lukman said.
    Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable
"minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPEC
is producing around what it said it would produce."
    After OPEC's price and production accord last December, the
market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to
around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was
producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.
    But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its
discipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experience
of what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations of
agreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.
    Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-owned
Petroleum Corp of Jamaica.

upgraded 500 mln dlrs of debt of Navistar International Corp
and its unit Navistar Financial Corp.
    Raised were the companies' senior debt to BB from B and
subordinated debt to B-plus from CCC-plus.
    S and P cited Navistar's recent issuance of 104 mln shares
of common stock and planned redemption of 515 mln dlrs of debt.
The recapitalization would save Navistar about 86 mln dlrs in
annual interest expense, the rating agency said.
    However, the ratings remain speculative because of severe
pricing pressures in the trucking industry, S and P stressed.

police in this northeastern city during a march to demand a
better deal from the EC, protest organisers said.
    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets
and occupied local government buildings in Saragossa.
    In the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more
than 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets to protest against
duties levied by the EC against their exports.
    Spain joined the community in January last year and farmers
say they have suffered competition from EC imports without
sufficient compensation.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER TO SELL CARS IN EUROPE BEFORE YEAR END</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp &lt;C> will begin exporting
vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, the world's
second largest market, which it left in 1978.
    Robert Lutz, executive vice president, told a news
briefing: "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about
to re-enter the European market. And we are here to stay."
    Michael Hammes, vice president of international operations,
said Chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by year
end. "By the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000." The first cars
would be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he
said.
    The European base would be in West Germany, but no final
decision had been made on other sites.
    The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, but
intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the
vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.
    Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather than
manufacture here because it will allow us to take full
competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to
the declining value of the dollar."
    The vehicles, on show at this week's Geneva motor show,
include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the Dodge
Lancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, the
Plymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.
    Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer, who
appreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.
    Prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the U.S.
Government in 1978, Chrysler sold its European operations to
Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.P>. Chrysler now owns 24 pct of Mitsubishi
Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and 15 pct of &lt;Maserati>, which may serve
as European distribution channels in future, Hammes said.

    A full ICO council meeting is set for 1900 hours local for
a progress report. Opinions among delegates over the potential
for reaching an agreement vary widely and several delegates
have said the chances of success were almost impossible to

<TITLE>FORD &lt;F> AIR-BAG PROGRAM FLAGGING - REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co's program to introduce
air-bags in its compact cars is facing widespread resistance
from both consumers and dealers, a trade paper said.
    As of February 20, Automotive News said Ford dealers had
sold only 455 1987-model Ford Tempos equipped with airbags and
294 similarly-equipped Mercury Topaz models compared with more
than 100,000 of the standard-equipped compact models.
    Ford has projected output of 12,000 Tempo and Topaz models
equipped with airbags in the 1987 model year, but Automotive
News said the current inventory of unsold cars represents a
disastrously high 1-1/2-year supply at current selling rates.
    Most of Ford's sales of the compact cars equipped with air
bags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S.
government, the paper said, with 11,000 having been sold since
they were announced in late 1985.
    Ford executives recently said their goal is to sell
annually between 500,000 and one mln cars equipped with air
bags by 1990 if the federal government will relax certain
regulatory standards as has been urged by some traffic safety
administrative staff.

downgraded to A-plus from AA-minus about 350 mln dlrs of senior
debt of PACCAR Inc and its unit PACCAR Financial Corp.
    S and P said PACCAR has experienced earnings weakness. But
the company remains profitable and should achieve significant

    The rating agency pointed out that price discounting has
eroded some of PACCAR's pricing advantage in the premium,
custom-built segment of the trucking industry, which is
PACCAR's traditional market niche.

<TITLE>ZIMBABWE'S MAIZE MOUNTAIN POSES ECONOMIC PROBLEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Gregson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>More than two mln tonnes of surplus maize
dotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic
headache for the country.
    The grain, Southern Africa's staple, has been bought by the
Grain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was
planted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in
storage and interest payments to make the purchases.
    Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the
surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and
is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.
    Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as European
countries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in
return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where the
United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the
hungry.
    But transport constraints keep those figures low and the
only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to South
Africa last year.
    Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot afford
to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been
accumulating, economists here said.
    But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets
is damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance
imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.
    "At present, it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of
the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
called for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aid
specialist said.
    "At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated the
situation too badly," he added. Rainfall during the current
rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the
irrigated lands of large commercial farmers.
    While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year
to the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slash
maize production and force diversification.
    Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds,
Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable
price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half
the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986, and above that
growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs.
    The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops,
such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the
Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/CHIP INDUSTRY SEEKS CUSTOM DESIGNS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Catherine Arnst, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,
struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking
toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for
future profits.
    The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed
for a very specific application or product - is expected to
expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six
pct for the entire integrated circuit industry.
     Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of
customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last
year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990, however,
customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15
billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.
    More important for their vendors, because they are not a
standard design customized chips represent a sellers' market,
and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly.
    High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commodity
market," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electrical
engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, told
an industry forum.
    "The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer
and another and customers base their buying decisions almost
entirely on price," Brodersen said. 
    He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of
the world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese)
will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component
found in everything from digital watches to computers. "The
rest of the industry just won't be involved."
    Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference,
the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed
to support Brodersen's prediction.
     Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct
had Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the
United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the
memory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's
attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory
(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now
available.
    The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company
was International Business Machine Corp's &lt;IBM> four mln bit
chip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use,
not for the open market.
    The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on
the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy
and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese
conglomerates as Sony Corp &lt;SNE>, NEC Corp, &lt;NIPNY> Matushita
and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics
product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for
their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low
cost per unit.
    Customized chips, however, are designed for a specific
customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive
relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly
looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,
thus making the final product harder to clone as well.
    Intel Corp &lt;INTC>, the leading manufacturer of the
microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted
the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips
last fall.
    The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it
will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself
into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.
    Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a
piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage
that the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake in
Intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000
chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those
designs and sell them to others.
    It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system
for designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the
most advanced in the world.
    Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. Industry
analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market
item than a customized chip that requires a close working
relationship with the customer.
    Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its
newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time,
and much lower development costs, will be required for
customized chips if the firm is to succeed.

<TITLE>CONTINENTAL ILL &lt;CIL> TO RECHARACTERIZE LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp settled an
administrative complaint by the Securities and Exchange
Commission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrs
previously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a "loss of
sale on loans."
    Under the settlement, which was announced simultaneously
with the filing of the SEC's administrative action, Continental
agreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the
425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping it
together with another item. The bank holding company said the
change does not affect its operating results for 1984.
    The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was not
challenging Continental's reported net loss for the second
quarter of 1984.
    But it said it was misleading for the bank to split the 950
mln dlr loan loss provision in half, attributing 425 mln dlrs
of it to the event of sale.
    The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlr
billion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC said.
    Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan
loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as a
loss on sale of loans, the SEC said.
    It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs as
loss on sale, which implied the loss would not have occurred
had there not been a sale of distressed loans to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp, the SEC said.
    The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss
instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the
other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans,
the SEC said.
    Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC without
admitting or denying any violations, the SEC said.
    But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to
accommodate the SEC's objections and to report to its
shareholders a summarized version of the SEC's administrative
action against it, the agency said.
    A Continental official stressed that the settlement in no
way will result in any change or restatement of the company's
earnings for that period.

cash flow are likely to continue for some time.
    This will result in stress on debt-protection measures,
although the firm's continuing core businesses have strong

<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S> DEAN WITTER UNIT AGREES TO SEC CENSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal regulators said Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc, the brokerage subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and
Co, agreed to a censure to settle charges that it failed to
fully report cash transactions.
    In a complaint which was issued simultaneously with the
settlement, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dean
Witter, the fourth largest U.S. brokerage house, with failing
to report more than one mln dlrs of cash transactions.
    In its administrative complaint, the SEC stressed that was
not charging Dean Witter with taking part in a scheme to
launder cash.
    But it said it found 35 single lump sum cash deposits in
excess of 10,000 dlrs made with Dean Witter's branch offices
and another three multiple cash deposits made by a customer on
a single day which totaled more than 10,000 dlrs. The total
unreported cash was 1,062,234 dlrs, the agency said.
    Federal law requires brokerage firms and banks to report to
the Treasury Department all cash deposits greater than 10,000
dlrs.
    After examining seven pct of the Dean Witter's branch
offices between July 1983 and April 1985, the SEC said it found
that the firm reported 1,880,376 dlrs in cash deposits, each of
which had been greater than 10,000 dlrs, but failed to report
another 1,062,234 dlrs.
    Besides agreeing to the censure, Dean Witter agreed to
tighten its oversight of its branch offices.
    Another major brokerage firm, E.F. Hutton Group Inc,
recently disclosed in an SEC filing that a federal grand jury
in Providence, R.I., was probing its compliance with cash
deposit reporting requirements at its Providence office.

effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing
countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year
started March 1, a government official said.
    The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin
Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and
boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto
appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from
its strategic stockpile.
    "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large
influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said
Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the
State Department. Last year the United States released about
4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.

accept for payment after the close of business today all the
common shares of Rexnord Inc that were tendered under its 26.25
dlr per share tender offer.
    Banner said its offer for all of the roughly 20 mln shares

    Combined with the roughly five mln shares it already holds,
Banner said it will own about 97 pct of Rexnord's shares.
    Banner said last Friday that it had arranged bank credit to
finance most of the tender offer and the subsequent merger with
Rexnord, under which remaining Rexnord holders may receive
26.25 dlrs a share.
    It said the balace of the funds will be obtained through a

<TITLE>DOT REJECTS SMOKING BAN ON DOMESTIC FLIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domestic
airline flights is not justified at this time.
    The department made known its conclusions in a report to
Congress, made public today, on a recommendation by the
National Academy of Sciences that such a ban be adopted.
    "We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could
be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, we
believe that further study is needed before the department can
propose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOT
report said.
    The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied the
issue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant.
    It recommended a ban in August after concluding that
tobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posed
potential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated 
passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.
    The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects of
environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and
distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.
    It also called for more study of possible changes in
aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more
time considering whether a ban should be extended to 
international as well as domestic flights.

<TITLE>AMC &lt;AMO> SAYS STEPS TAKEN AFTER UAW TALKS FAIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp said it will take
steps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified
"alternative location" after the weekend breakdown of talks
with the United Automobile Workers union on a concessionary
contract covering workers at AMC's Wisconsin operations.
    AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company
will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its
Kenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks'
failure.
    "We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibility
for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining
committees," the company said in a statement.
    "We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to
place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather
than at Kenosha."
    UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard
the collapse of talks as final after the company's "final"
proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by union
bargainers.
    But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessions
package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose
6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not be
getting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract.
    "This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of
maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing
U.S. operations," AMC said.
    Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out
the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final,
Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they would
accept our final proposal, that's another matter."
    But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75
had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor
rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a
concessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations.
    AMC, which last week reported its first profitable quarter
in two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants with
labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the
UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S.
    Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by
driving down AMC's stock price. In active trading, AMC was off
3/8 to 3-1/2, a 9.7 pct decline since Friday's close.

<TITLE>GULF ARAB OIL MEETING ENDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy oil ministers of the six-nation
Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) ended a meeting here after
discussing co-ordination and co-operation in the oil field, the
Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) said.
    The deputy ministers, who declined to talk to reporters on
the outcome of the 90 minute formal session, later concluded a
round of informal talks.
    The GCC groups four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  and non-OPEC nations
Bahrain and Oman.
    Before the formal session had begun, chairman Yousef
Shirawi, Bahrain's Development and Industry Minister, told
reporters the gathering was a follow-up to talks held last
Sunday in Qatar at full ministerial level.
    GNA gave no details on the outcome of today's talks.
    It said only, "The deputy ministers discussed current
developments in the oil market, particularly those relating to
production and prices."
    The meeting in Qatar had reaffirmed the six Gulf Arab
countries' commitment to OPEC's pricing and production accord
forged in December last year.
    It also discussed ways of marketing crude oil on behalf of
those GCC states encountering resistance to official OPEC
prices.
    Oil industry sources have said Qatar has faced particular
difficulty in selling its full quota of production.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GOVERNMENT BOND BROKER SEES WIDER DATA ACCESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The major U.S. Government bond brokers
are likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors
within the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens
available to many of those firms that are not now eligible to
receive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco International
Inc.
    Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in
RMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers
that dominate the business.
    In a telephone interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, we
think the number of players will be expanded."
    Currently, the four major brokers will sell their
direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S.
Government securities or those that have applied to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.
    The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether
limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers
is a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.
    Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite
group of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly
from the Fed.
    But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the
brokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as
far-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens
available to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is
more likely that a "second tier" will be established.
    He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the
group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens
widely available to any one who wants them.
    Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better
prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major
competitors.
    Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure
for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any
time soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were
cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.
    Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that
with further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cut
without hurting the brokers' profits.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS STRUGGLE TO AGREE ON DAIRY CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community, EC, agriculture
ministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at
limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at
high guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.
    The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut
dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last
December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.
    The accord, which is due to operate from the start of the
new milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the most
significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC
farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.
    Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not
threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened
if the proposals are altered too radically.
    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on
a farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into
public stores when market prices and stocks are high.
    Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes
costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged
to cut production to meet demand.
    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before
the ministers move on to consider this year's annual price
review which proposes extending the new system for butter sales
to other sectors such as cereals.

<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S> TO RESTRUCTURE DISTRIBUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears, Roebuck and Co said it will
restructure its distribution operations, resulting in a 20 mln
dlr after-tax charge against earnings in its first quarter.
    The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago
distribution center as the first part of the restructuring. A
spokesman said up to 1,800 workers will be affected, with many
of them laid off. Some of the workers may be transferred to
other Sears operations.
    Sears said the restructuring and consolidation will save
about 150 mln dlrs by 1991.
    Sears said it will set up a nationwide network of seven
regions to handle all aspects of distribution of its products.
    The closing of the Chicago plant will be followed by the
shutdown of four other distribution units over the next several
years. Distribution centers will be closed in Boston, Atlanta,
Memphis and Minneapolis, with the Boston shutdown coming early
next year. No other closings are planned before 1989.
    A spokesman said that, while there will be layoffs at those
facilities, the company does not yet know how many workers will
be let go.
    Sears' distribution will be consolidated under regional
management in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Greensboro, N.C.,
Jacksonville, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Los Angeles and
Philadelphia. However, Sears said it will also evaluate the
productivity of the Los Angeles and Philadelphia facilities "to
determine whether they will be modernized or relocated."
    Responsibility for ordering distribution center inventory
will be centralized in Chicago.

<TITLE>VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary
has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker
for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie
said.
    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific
Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8
icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and
engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.
    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln
dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the
construction of the vessel.
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be
required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically
and financially capable of performing the work."
    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than
competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of
direct employment.
    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most
powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and
completed in 1992.
    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last
year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast
Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest
Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the
journey, claiming the area was an international water way.
    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up
the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.

<TITLE>CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuba has told international sugar
operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that
these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct
shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the
language of the message was not totally clear and some believed
shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet
Union as the destination of their contracts.
    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last
week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export
availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.
    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately
available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was
probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender
last month.
    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward
delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the
sale of several cargoes.
    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive
March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export
markets, traders said.

<TITLE>GOODRICH &lt;GR> TO PHASE OUT SOME BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>B.F. Goodrich Co said it will phase
out the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine
products and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end
of 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance
and support services employees.
    The company said layoffs will start within the next few
weeks.
    Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and
adhesives in Akron, employing about 356.  Another 5000 salaried
employees in Akron work for Goodrich.
    The company said it has not been able to operate the
businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to
justify the large investment that it has in them.
    Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at
Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will
relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet
chosen.  It said it will stop making insulators for missiles.
    Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of
the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected
employees and issues related to the continued operation in
Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the
phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and
molded rubber products manufacturing.
    A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse
impact on earnings from the move.

<TITLE>(RPT) U.S. SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. tin disposals should have little
effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing
countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year
started March 1, a government official said.
    The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin
Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and
boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto
appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from
its strategic stockpile.
    "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large
influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said
Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the
State Department. Last year the United States released about
4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.

<TITLE>DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS &lt;DPCZ> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diagnostic Products Corp president and
chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
1987 as the company has for the past five years.
    "We expect the same performance in net income over the next
five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Currency fluctuations may reassert their
influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.

<TITLE>NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

bid by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc for 22 dlrs a share.
    Rospatch earlier requested its stock be halted in over the

    Diagnostic said its bid was for a total 53 mln dlrs through
a cash tender offer for all, but not less than 51 pct of
Rosptach outstanding common.
    For its fourth-quarter ended December 31, 1986, Rospatch
reported net loss 2,649,000 or 1.10 dlrs a share compared a
loss of 627,500 or 35 cts profit for the 1985 period.
    In December the Brookehill Group in New York said it had
9.7 pct stake. J.A. Parini, Rospatch chief executive, responded
on January eight by saying the investment was a vote in

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
and other programs for television.

<TITLE>U.S. ELECTRONIC SALES FLAT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. electronic companies'
sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the
228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic
Association said.
    Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1
billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of
1984, the AEA said.
    AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although
the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the
end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures
before trying to forecast the future.
    "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector,
are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade
deficit with Japan," he said.
    Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1
pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were
22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.
    The association represents more than 2,800 firms that
produce electronic goods and services.

<TITLE>TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's decision to raise the issue
of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see
as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy
study group said 
    "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,
when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.
    U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,
the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
of about 150 billion dlrs annually.
    The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline
of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in
U.S.-Canadian relations.
   The study said liberalized trade between the two countries
would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.
    The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away
from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be
overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
association with a country 10 times their size in population."
    But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their
domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
increasingly competitive world.
    The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly
interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against 
allegedly subsidized exports.
    A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed
on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
subsidized.
    The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending
curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting
and films.
    It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense
cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian
assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.

<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL> UNIT ATTACKED ON MINORITY HIRING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc's United Airlines was accused in
a congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of key
jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in
minority hiring.
    The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government
Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins,
called the treatment of minorities by the country's largest
airline "pathetic."
    "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the
number of white women pilots is more than double that of black
pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in
upper management."
    United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase
its minority employment.
    David Pringle, United's senior vice president for human
resources, said "We take a very aggressive approach to minority
hiring and have made tremendous progress ... we will continue
to pursue even wider goals."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the
largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its
specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better
its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.
    "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added
businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told
reporters at an informal meeting here.
    ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.
drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart
Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current
pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.
    Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in
the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."
    ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug
maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were
about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,
which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.
    He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division
would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.
    "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate
of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who
was also at the meeting.
    Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically
act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.
    Henderson said the major new products in the company's
pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,
Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,
a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
    Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing
agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until
about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin
in the U.S. later this year.
    Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986
income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15
billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.
    Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden
Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a
unit of Hanson Industries Inc.
    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs
available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40
acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more
acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."
    Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective
April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who
will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years
after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

<TITLE>FUNARO REJECTS UK SUGGESTION OF IMF BRAZIL PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek
International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt
negotiations with commercial creditor banks.
    Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not
help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended
indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external
debt on February 20.
    Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of
European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt
moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve
capital flows between developed countries and third world
debtor nations.
   Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could
be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan
after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big
recession."
    "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and
import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said.
    Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his
talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the
U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a
problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.
    Britain also believed an IMF program would help along
negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the
statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright
rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.
    "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But
if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then
that means nothing is helping to find a solution."
    Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and
in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to
unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to
deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.
    "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my
country," he said.
    He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's
efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the
two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring
meetings in Washington, Funaro said.
    Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's
debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to
Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.
    "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said,
"We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what
happens."
    Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current
domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead
to a five pct economic growth this year.
    "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and
received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said.
"What we have to offer is our cooperation."

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>All major grain producing countries
must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
wheat organizations said.
    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel
they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world
grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
    Future discussions on international wheat trade should
include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
two organizations said 
    While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
assessments.
    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
farmers, they said.
      Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim
Miller, president of NAWG said.
    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.

<DATELINE>    EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gelco Corp said that,
excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expects
pre-tax operating earnings for the year to end July 31, 1987,
to be about the same as those of last year.
    For the year ended July 31, 1986, Gelco reported pre-tax
operating earnings of 14.8 mln dlrs, or 1.08 dlrs a share.
    However, final results will be affected by certain charges
including legal and investment advisors fees, preferred stock
dividends and other costs of restructuring, it said.
    Expenses associated with restructuring are expected to be
offset by "significant" gains from the sale of some of Gelco's
business units, it said.
    The final outcome for the fiscal year will be determined by
the timing and proceeds from the sale, it added.

<TITLE>PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New york, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he
has had discussions with several American Medical International
Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
company.
    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
takeover bid for American Medical with several large
shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
one way or the other for his offer, he said.
    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
support for his offer.
    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
stock.
    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
management and other American Medical shareholders.
    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and
appropriate at this time."
    "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.
    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
rule out a future takeover try.
    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
with the Bass family.
    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
Pesch.
    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
support management's internal plan to improve the company's
performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
Medical or Pesch.
    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
acquisition.
    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
    "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
environment," Pesch said.
    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
Medical management in place.
    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
form an efficient network of hospitals.
    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
be made for American Medical.
    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
about 20 dlrs per share.
    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
loss last year.
    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
could be completed because of the revised structure of the
offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.
    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

<TITLE>THREE CONVICTED IN HOME STATE FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Marvin Warner and two fellow officers
of the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges
connected with the collapse of Home State.
    Warner, the owner of Home State, was found guilty of six
counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home
State money without authorization from the board of directors
-- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985
collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful
misapplication.
    Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted
of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a
former president, was convicted on three of four counts of
securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of
willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction
    The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a
state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan
companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as
the firms were able to show proof of their solvency.
    Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a
1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel
pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.
    Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and
Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said
that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his
convictions.
    All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of
Home State funds through investments with ESM Government
Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt
and triggered the collapse of Home State.
    On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all
of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and
they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit
insurance or merge with other companies which had federal
deposit insurance.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Efforts to break an impasse between
coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the
world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to
have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group
meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio
Dauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had
been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate
market shares rather than negotiate them.
    Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations
at a later date.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in
Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and
Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country'rate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR PUROLATOR&lt;PCC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several analysts said they do not
believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for
Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former stock broker and an investor
who pleaded guilty last June to insider trading as a
participant in the scheme that involved lawyer Michael David
were sentenced by the Manhattan federal court today.
    Morton Shapiro, who was employed as a broker at Moseley
Hallgarten Stabrook and Weeden Inc, drew a two month jail
sentence and a 25,000 dlr fine.
    Daniel J. Silverman, who pleaded guilty to securities
fraud, was sentenced to three years probation, a 25,000 dlr
fine, and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service.
    As a result of trading on information supplied by David,
while he was at the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison, the defendants gained about 160,000 dlrs in their
insider trading scheme, according to U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani.
    The prosecutor also said Shapiro attempted to conceal his
unlawful trading by lying in testimony before the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy
futures markets April one.
    An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil
traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after
the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be
hedged in the futures market.
    EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are
expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S.
energy futures, according to traders and analysts.
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

United States and the Virgin Islands have signed a tax treaty
to exchange tax information and provide mutual assistance in
tax matters.
    The agreement was needed to trigger provisions of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 allowing the Virgin Islands to offer
investment incentives by reducing Virgin Islands taxes on
non-U.S. source income, the Treasury said.
    The treaty will be a model for similar agreements to be
negotiated with three other U.S. possessions -- American Samoa,
the Mariana Islands and Guam, the Treasury said.
    The new agreement, which expands and replaces a prior
agreement with the Virgin Islands, was signed on February 24,
the Treasury said.

<TITLE>KIDDER UNIT SELLS CMOS, INCLUDING FLOATERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust
Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln
dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,
including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.
    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer
said.
    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an
initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly
according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of
1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.
    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the
500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 -</DATELINE><BODY>The New York Mercantile Exchange expects
to submit a propane futures contract for federal regulatory
approval within a few days, according to an exchange
spokeswoman.
    As previously announced, the Board of Governors of the
exchange approved the contract last month. The exchange will
now submit the contract to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, according to the spokeswoman.
    Contract specifications will resemble those of heating oil
and gasoline futures. The contract size will be 1,000 barrels,
or 42,000 U.S. gallons.
    The minimum price fluctuation for the propane futures
contract will be  0.01 cent per gallon, or 4.20 dlrs a barrel,
according to the exchange.
    The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on
all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last
business day of the month preceding the delivery month.
    The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's
pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu,
Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern
Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.
    Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer,
inter-facility transfer or pumpover, or book transfer and
cannot be done earlier than the tenth calendar day of the
delivery month, according to the exchange. Deliveries must be
completed no later than two business days prior to the end of
the delivery month.
    Buyers taking delivery of the propane must pay the seller
by certified check and the deadline for payment is 1200 EST
(noon) of the second business day following receipt of the
propane.

<TITLE>YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of
Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another
major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.
    In a statement issued by the trade representative's office
following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board
of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe
impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion
dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.
    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its
(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to
vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to
the European market," Yeutter said.
    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate
EC obligations under the GATT.
    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price
of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine
made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,
and closer in price to expensive European butter.
    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such
a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved
the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to
include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.
    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational
course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are
beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global
trade talks)," he said.

<TITLE>GREECE SAYS IT HAS RIGHT ON AEGEAN OIL DRILLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey
against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today
it had the right to decide where and how to do research or
drilling work in the area.
    A government spokesman said the Greek position was made
clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.
    Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today
Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976
Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean
continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.
    The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to
give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed.
It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or
how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government."
    "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side
know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive
through the fault of Turkey," it said.
    The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the
continental shelf issue before international courts.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leucadia National Corp said two of
its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc,
a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and
used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del.,
investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St.
Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined
1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only.
    The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in
Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July.
    Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800
Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs.
    Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an
equity position in the company and has no intention of seeking
control of it.
    Nearly half of Leucadia's common stock is owned by TLC
Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose
partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and
other investors.

    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the
issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often
heated talks, delegates said.
    Export quotas -- the major device of the International
Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year
ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in
Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.
    Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee
prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year
lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French industry is failing to produce the
goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
    The report said the French economy was "increasingly
ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative
prices on both domestic and export markets."
    "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
months," it said.
    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
industrialised countries."
    This could result in further major losses of market share,
particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
quarter of French exports, it said.
    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic
manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
more briskly," it added.
    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
    "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
been lost," one OECD official commented.
    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
to around 2.5 or three pct.
    The government last week revised its forecast up to between
2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
    But the OECD backed the government's view that the
underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
disinflation.
    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
pct this year, it said.
    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
as companies built up their profits.
    "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"
it said.

<TITLE>SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
laws.
    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
been interviewed by the SEC probers.
    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
and had heard nothing more since that time.
    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,
he said.
    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
    "We had nothing to do with TRE."
    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
comment on its enforcement activities.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

<TITLE>USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain trade representatives continued
to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer
subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture
Department officials said there was no substance to the
reports.
    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's
Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the
administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow
in the next two to three weeks.
    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not
to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the
speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the
(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the
basis of the speculation.
    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan
administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain
trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as
much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before
mid-year, if it was "competitively priced."
    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading
organization, told Reuters he had no information to
substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but
said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was
competitively priced.
    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are
looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the
administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they
should find ways to do it."

to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in
wages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers'
International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.
    "It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz
said in an interview.
    The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes
and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in
January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help
settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of
March.
    The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in
crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400
jobs.

<TITLE>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING DOWN THREE PCT IN JAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Contracting for future construction
work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of
236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.
    The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding
construction was largely responsible for the month's setback
from December's higher level.
    Residential building eased three pct in January, while
contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional
buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.
    Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized
rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only
major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to
43.1 billion.
    Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction
advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for
1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after
the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending
authority.
    Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an
annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional
structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the
reason for the gain, the report said.
    Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in
January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally
adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be
strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage
rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as
a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

    Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over
successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food
production appeared to be gathering strength.
    In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of
Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a
better deal from Brussels.
    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets
and occupied local government buildings while in the southern
city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons
on the streets in protest at EC duties.
    Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West
German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning
effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France
pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.
    Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the
European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit
farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public
stores at high guaranteed EC prices.
    In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review,
at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could
result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.
    The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform
surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political
embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and
threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas.
    Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a
decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and
to slash beef prices by around 10 pct.
    That decision, agreed in outline last December after
virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the
most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has
since run into difficulties over the fine print.
    West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules
governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the
Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has
been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package.
    Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and
resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before
starting the price review which is confidently predicted to
last many months.
    EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an
overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost
entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this
year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    SAN MATAO, Calif., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Calny Inc said it has filed a
multi-million-dlr suit against PepsiCo Inc and its La Petite
Boulangerie unit.
    Calny, which holds 15 La Petite Boulangerie franchises,
alleges it and PepsiCo breached their agreements with Calny by
failing to support the franchises in a number of ways.
    The company further alleges that PepsiCo and La Petite
Boulangerie had fiduciary responsibilities to Calny because of
the longstanding relationship between Calny and Taco Bell, also
a PepsiCo subsidiary. Calny operates 143 Taco Bell restaurants.
    Calny said Pepsico misrepresented the readiness of the La
Petite Boulangerie to expand outside San Francisco and
misrepresented costs involved in operating the restaurants.

<TITLE>JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the
Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its
current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in
December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-worst level set last December. Record male
unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
to the record level marked in April, August, September and
December last year.
    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed
from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in
export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation
against the dollar, officials said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a
year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the
textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06
mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders,
down 170,000.

    "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability
of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government
is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of
the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.
    Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up
further because this might spark off inflation and depress the
U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.
    The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec remains within its agreed output
ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current
fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian
Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
oil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were
using up old stock, he said.
    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production
ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:
"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.
    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to
manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the
cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through
present price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third
and fourth quarters of 1987.
    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency
Opec meeting.
    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the
spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and
predict the price will be better in the third and fourth
quarters."
    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members
stuck together.

<TITLE>OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government's industry aid and
protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission
(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat
industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.
    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance
to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
he said in a statement.
    He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the
underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing
Act expire.
    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes
which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"
he said.
    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
underwriting support from the government for the first time," he
said.
    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian
Wheat Board near the start of the season.
    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the
findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,
Handling and Transport, Kerin said.
    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its
findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in
later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
federal and state governments and the industry.

<TITLE>COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at
least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss
quotas was set, delegates said.
    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after
prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.
    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and
exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
breakdown of the talks.
    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and
delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not
prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
criteria.
    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas
based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
political influence in the ICO."
    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster
countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to
dictate quotas, not negotiate them."
    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted
quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's
share to 28.8 pct.
    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
readily available to consumers when they need it.
    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest
exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
proposal could not bring the two sides together.
    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,
illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
protect its coffee export earnings.
    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and
Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure
to agree quotas, analysts said.
    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
forecast.
    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full
council is not due to meet again until September, delegates
said.

    Diplomats said member states were unable to settle

original arms sales to Iran and 35 pct thought he was telling
the truth.
    The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved Reagan's

<TITLE>EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE TO SHAKE NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were
treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the
seismologist added.
    A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared
yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access
to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry
town of Kawerau severely restricted.
    Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.
    Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides
in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to
most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being
repaired.
    Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before
flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference
of foreign ministers.
    A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist
civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources
said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when
the buildings are declared safe.

<TITLE>JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese investor interest in British
gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations
sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and
on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.
    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been
expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors
seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which
have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.
    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has
been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office
of a British securities firm said.
    On the other hand, major long-term investors such as
Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about
buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the
Japanese financial year, traders said.
    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through
dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying
in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British
securities house said.
    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from
234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of
230 to 234 late last year.
    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will
further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from
further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.
    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,
suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand
from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager
Machiko Suzuki.
    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded
11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against
9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.
    The economists said the service sector should grow as the
government stimulates domestic demand under its program to
transform the economy away from exports.
    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than
those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating
statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.
    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively
high figure if European methods were used," one economist said.
More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a
year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's
Tsukihara said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKER PLEA ON EXCHANGE RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    The federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.
    It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against
the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won
climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars
remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.
    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar
will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.
    Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's
ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.
    The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.
    Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January
to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same
figures show.
    Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, after
electrical and electronic products.
    Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year
from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were
worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs.

<DATELINE>    CAIRO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt allowed five fugitive Libyan
soldiers who landed in a military plane in the far south of the
country last night to stay and flew them to Cairo, official
sources said.
    It appeared the government had agreed to demands by the
five -- two officers and three privates -- for political asylum
but there was no immediate announcement.
    Official sources said Egyptian servicemen flew the Libyans
north from Abu Simbel in their C-130 transport plane. The
status of the sixth Libyan on board, the pilot, was not
immediately known.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

<TITLE>JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
authorised exporters.
    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
not automatically be denied licences, he said.
    But some industry officials predicted any government
measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
world semiconductor market remained weak.
    U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market
is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
distributing their products through their sales network knowing
they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
them what they are doing to reduce the figure."
    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long
as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
make money," a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.

<TITLE>BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's improving economy will likely
cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion
dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at
end-February, private bankers said.
    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to
3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.
    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank
Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively
high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,
and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,
contributed to the projected sharp rise.
    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to
expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.
    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could
achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up
from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.
    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its
current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable
the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.
    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,
special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target
is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Singapore's Finance Minister Richard
Hu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no
major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1,
bankers and economists told Reuters.
    They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in
calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct
shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course
and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work.
    Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct,
and income tax was reduced by the same margin.
    Last year the government also reduced wage costs by
introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to
the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund
(CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.
    "I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the
economy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice president
of the Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued
last week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting
measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.
    But the report said over half the economy -- especially the
commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued
to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional
economies and an excess of domestic property.
    The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery
suggested the government would not introduce much of its
planned consumption tax in the coming financial year.
    In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up
collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign
against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to
levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.
    The sources said the government does not look likely to
raise more revenue in this year's budget.
    Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget
deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected
an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion.
    Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income
and stringent controls on government operating expenditure,
helped by the wage-freeze policy.
    Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager
of American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting
from this year's budget.
    Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of the
tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already
started moving so it does not need government support."
    Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline
in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in
private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from
the budget, economists said.
    The economic report said the sector's activity declined by
25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985.
A further decline is expected in 1987.
    But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for
industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until
the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add
incentives for creating property investment unit trusts.
    The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are
incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives
to families who have three children.
    Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced
the government will try to encourage three-child families,
instead of the two-child families it encourages now.

<TITLE>FISONS SEES STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said strong
international growth had been the main feature of the group's
1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
643p.
    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly
indicated by a strong 1986 performance.
    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full
programme of capital investment.
    Action to protect the group against foreign currency
movements resulted in a small net gain to profits.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines must devalue the peso if
it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.
    "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports
more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question about
it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
deliberately undervalued their currencies."
    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
able to continue to respond to market conditions.
    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher,
our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it
in terms of the economy."
    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
    "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
become uncompetitive because then we are dead."
    Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
thing."
    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
expected to touch five pct this year.
    He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.
    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the
dollar when it was floated in 1984.

<TITLE>ZAIRE ACCEPTS TIN-EXPORT QUOTA, ATPC SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zaire agreed to limit its tin
exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with
an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb
exports, the ATPC said.
    ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he
received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take
part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes
for a year from March 1.
    Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of
tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports
were about 1,200 tonnes.
    The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by
20,000 tonnes and boost prices.
    All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed
to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan.
Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to
its expected output this year.
    The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire.
    China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not
members.

<TITLE>JAPANESE FINANCIAL FUTURES PLAN REVEALED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federation of Bankers' Associations of
Japan released its proposal for early creation of a
comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.
    The market should include a comprehensive range of futures
and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global
money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is
available, the proposal said.
    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and
incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock
index futures contracts.
    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must
be conducted on the same market so participants can readily
engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.
    To make this possible, the proposal calls for new
legislation which would administer all related futures and
options transactions under the same legal framework.
    Banking sources said they expect that initially the
currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would
include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,
three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury
bonds.
    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as
saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible
because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's
financial markets.
    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective
market participants to banks but was willing to accept those
from wider business circles, the sources said.
    Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen
bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.
    But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading
in a basket of leading stocks in April.

former currency clerk of Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> with
misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in July in an alleged
foreign-exchange fraud.
    A spokeswoman for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs
Commission (CAC) said the arrest was part of its investigation
stemming from complaints from Westpac and &lt;Kleinwort Benson
Australia Ltd>.
    CAC and Westpac officials said they were working out how
much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much
as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.
    Police told reporters it was alleged the former clerk
quoted an incorrect dealing price relationship between the yen
and the Swiss franc.
    They said the CAC was investigating 14 other cases
involving 214,000 dlrs.
    A Kleinwort Benson spokesman declined to comment on the
case but the company said in a statement yesterday a small loss
incurred in 1986 in its foreign-exchange division was unrelated
to "certain alleged forex irregularities."

<TITLE>JAPAN LIKELY TO LET U.S. BANKS DEAL SECURITIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to
conduct securities business here, a move that will probably
cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from
brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.
    But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to
conflicting domestic interests.
    J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT>,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Chemical Bank New York
Corp &lt;CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities
business in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.
    "There is no reason for extended delay of approval," one
official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been
seeking finance ministry approval for months.
    To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securities
business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese
banks can conduct securities business in European countries,
this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for
Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.
    But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will press
hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct
securities business in the U.S.
    Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be
approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the
decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the
finance ministry declined comment.
    U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on
financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months.
Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April
or June.
    At the last round of financial negotiations in September,
U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was
flagging.
    Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously
considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve
Bank of New York approved five new primary government
securities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, last
December.
    They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S.
Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open
to foreigners as those of the U.S.
    Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial
deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear
division between the securities and banking businesses.
    Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to
protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are
finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional
fields.
    Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay
special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank
requests because approval would accelerate market
liberalization in Japan.
    The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for
their own entry into the domestic securities market.

<TITLE>CURRENCY SECTORS CONTINUE TO FEATURE EUROBOND TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market
on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.
    The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.
    The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how
anybody is going to make any money," he said.
    Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.
    There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting
trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started
the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.
    FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian --
banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press
reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.
    "(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to
Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis
after things had more or less quietened down following the
first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said.
    Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight
secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early
features on the primary market.
    These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan
Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4
pct.
    The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.
    Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr&#127;untied loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum
Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.
    No further details on the loan were immediately available.
    Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion
in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in
the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.
    The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on
the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and
construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
    The project also includes construction of liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional
crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia
complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion
of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.
    Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and
materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will
enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz
rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some
LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan
diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.

<TITLE>COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its return
to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium
prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
proposed dividend imputation laws.
    This would make five cents for the year against a first and
final of one cent in 1985.
    Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
dollar had helped earnings.
    Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint
venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand
Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo
Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases
in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.
    As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth Aluminium
Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at
Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon
to &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>.
    Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary
provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if
the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the
provision made in the 1986 accounts.
    The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5
mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange
losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.

<TITLE>CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ME}LBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to
pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.
    The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.
    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.
    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
gold producers.
    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
but overcapacity continues, CRA said.
    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said
Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.
    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
1985, CRA said.
    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
from 2.8 mln.
    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
future tax provisions, CRA said.
    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0
mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
     The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added
     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
     The paper also printed a table showing that, since
bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be
dominated or controlled by international Communism."
     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
them.
     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
which the U.S. Side won, he said.
     But, for the first time, China signed last week an
agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.
     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
China's interest in participating in GATT.
     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.
     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
benefit from its GATT participation," he said.
     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance
planning" and economic levers.
     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
do.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<TITLE>TAIWAN BANKS ASKED TO TAKE PART IN INDONESIA LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, Mar 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd of Hong Kong has
approached Taiwan banks to take part in a syndicated loan of
300 mln U.S. Dlrs to finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
project in Indonesia, local banking sources said.
    The project calls for construction of a 400 mln U.S. Dlr
facility which could produce two mln tonnes of LNG for supply
by Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp .
    This was the first time Taiwanese banks, including the Bank
of Taiwan and Bank of Communications, were invited to form a
syndicated loan, they added.
    Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese
Petroleum Corp &lt;CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG
for Taiwan starting October 1989, a CPC official said.
    CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern
Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The
terminal will be completed in mid-1989.
    A Taiwanese banker said"It will be a good idea for our banks
to take part in the loan if we want to start in the
international lending market."

has signed a one billion dlr contract to sell 10 A320
short-haul jets to &lt;All Nippon Airways> of Japan, with an

    The spokesman declined to comment on a New York Times

    But industry sources said American was about to announce
the purchase of 25 wide-bodied planes from Airbus, as well as
15 747s from Boeing Co &lt;BAN>.
    Airbus has already signed large deals with Pan Am Corp

    The A320 made its first flight on February 22 and is not

    The All Nippon purchase brings the total number of

- Zimbabwe's maize crop in 1986/87 (April/ March) is likely to
be slightly over 1.6 mln tonnes, against 1.83 mln in 1985/86,
Grain Marketing Board figures show.
    Maize exports for 1986/87 to January 31, 1987 totalled
315,000 tonnes, with about a further 40,000 tonnes expected to

rains. Last year's consumption was around 700,000 tonnes.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

<TITLE>COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comalco Ltd said its return to profit
reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and
its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
proposed dividend imputation laws.
    This would make five cents for the year against a first and
final of one cent in 1985.
    Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer
from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
dollar had helped earnings.
    Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it
has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in
Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia
Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of
27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be
reduced if the sales agreement were completed.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SEEK GREATER BRAZIL LINK WITH IMF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Anthony Williams, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German banks would like Brazil to work
more closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a
view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems,
senior West German banking sources said.
    The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today
between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West
german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazil
should come up with a convincing economic recovery program.
    Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.
    Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve
governments in negotiations with commercial banks on
rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some
109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve
its problems with the banks rather than governments.
    Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early
tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this
evening.
    Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the
IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an
austerity program with the Fund.
    However, the West German banking sources said institutions
here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a
credible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement"
with the IMF.
    "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said one
banker.
    Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to
suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial
debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by
foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.
    One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt
negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro
for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of
banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.
    Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct of
Brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory
committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil
might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,
involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since European
banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative
debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.
    The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional
approach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution."
But he added: "There must be an understanding that special
requests from special regions be taken into account."
    German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of
interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It
was imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menu
must become richer," the banker said.
    Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved
in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in
Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.
    West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the
Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in
the United States, because of their lower exposure.
    According to Bundesbank data from September last year, West
German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16
billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign
credit.

<TITLE>AQUINO ANNOUNCES LAND REFORM PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Corazon Aquino announced
government plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24
billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the
sale of failed businesses taken over by the government.
    Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar
estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform
programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.
    "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is above
the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are
Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are
enacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters.
    A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan,
including the question of whether land operated by
multinational companies should also be covered, she added.
    Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently
the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land
to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform
programme.
    The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also covers
sugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, he
said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless
peasants, he added.
    Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break
up her family's 6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her
sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of
the most pressing problems facing the Philippines.
    It was not known whether government would wait for the
Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or
have Aquino carry it out through an executive order.
    Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly from
landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include
vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectares
seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand
Marcos.

<TITLE>OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec remains within its agreed output
ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current
fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian
Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that
present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of
warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for
oil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were
using up old stock, he said.
    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production
ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:
"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.
    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to
manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the
cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through
present price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third
and fourth quarters of 1987.
    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency
Opec meeting.
    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the
spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and
predict the price will be better in the third and fourth
quarters."
    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock
deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price
to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members
stuck together.

<TITLE>JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.

    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile

    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold

<TITLE>JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese investor interest in British
gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations
sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and
on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.
    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been
expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors
seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which
have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.
    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has
been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office
of a British securities firm said.
    On the other hand, major long-term investors such as
Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about
buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the
Japanese financial year, traders said.
    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through
dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying
in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British
securities house said.
    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from
234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of
230 to 234 late last year.
    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will
further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from
further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.
    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,
suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand
from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager
Machiko Suzuki.
    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded
11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against
9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London.

<TITLE>DAIMLER OUTPUT COULD BE AFFECTED BY DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car
production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable
future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the
firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.
    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's
Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for
Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the
beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the
state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ
more workers.
    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the
Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other
plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.
    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which
is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think
Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on
overtime by its own works councils.
    A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed
down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union
sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later
settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.
    The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was
currently around 2,500 a day.

<TITLE>HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The price of Hongkong and Shanghai
Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
brokers said.
    They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
from Liang as long term investment.
    He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of
Hk Hotels."
    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
Hk Hotels.
    &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
    Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
    "It is purely coincidence," he said.
    But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
    Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
    Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
the Hk Hotels board.
    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
not considered any countermoves so far.
    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
styles.
    "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked
not to be named.
    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
current trading price.
    Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
Ltd>.
    Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

    The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved Reagan's
handling of his job and 46 pct disapproved. The approval rating
was the lowest since January 1983, when 41 pct approved of the
way Reagan was doing his job.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CUTS WAGE BOOSTS FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp has changed its
method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is
reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the
total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a
company spokesman said.
    He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the
calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum
payments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be included
in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change
affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.
                                       
    GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for
salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As
a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base
pay rates of salaried employees.
    The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain
cost-competitive with other U.S. automakers.
    GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cut
employment of salaried workers by 25 pct.

<DATELINE>    ADA, Okla., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc said it
has signed a letter of intent under which it would receive
financing from I.C.H. Corp.
    The company said under the proposed transaction I.C.H.
would loan it up to 100 mln dlrs, and the loan balance would be
convertible at any time by either party into Pre-Paid common
stock at 11 dlrs per share.  In addition, it said it would
grant I.C.H. a five-year option to purchase new shares at the
same price.  It said the option would enable I.C.H. to acquire
up to 500 pct plus one share of Pre-Paid common.
    Pre-Paid said until expiration of the option, and as long
as Pre-Paid maintained a mutually agreeable combined loss and
expense ratio, I.C.H. would, on Pre-Paid's request, exercise as
much of the option as may be necessary to meet Pre-Paid's
funding needs.
    The company said I.C.H. has requested the right to buy
90,909 Pre-Paid shares from Pre-Paid chairman Harland C.
Stoneciphjer for 11 dlrs each.  Stonecipher now owns or has the
right to acquire 1,965,269 Pre-Paid shares and will agree to
restrictions on the sale of his remaining shares, it said. The
company saiod Stonecipher will remain chairman.
    Pre-Paid said the transactions are subject to approval by
boards of both comnpanies and regulatory agencies.

<TITLE>NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Employers and the port union, FNV, are
to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the
six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but
neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told
Reuters.
    Little progress was made in last night's three hours of
talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.
    "There is still a very large gap between the employers and
the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.
But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.
    Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused
the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all
over the past two months.
    "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am
really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at
all."
    "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to
accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,
then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin
later this month," Schoufour said.
    The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them
more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the
past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800
redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with
350 this year.
    Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said
unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw
the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.
    Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out
their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from
him before Wednesday at the earliest.

company spokesman said.
    He would not comment on the subject of the press
conference, or would he confirm published reports that AMR will
today announce a 2.5 billion dlr purchase of aircraft and
engines.
    According to a New York Times report, AMR is expected to

&lt;Airbus Industrie> and 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> 767's and the choice
of General Electric Co &lt;GE> to supply all 80 engines for the
craft.  The engine order alone, for 80 CF80C-2's, would be
worth about 500 mln dlrs.
    The Airbus plane order would be worth about 1.25 billion
dlrs and the Boeing order about 750 mln dlrs, according to the
report.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group saw
improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the
Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.
    Very good progress was made last year, while the recent
acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant
addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to
come.
    Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax
profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period,
making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full
year.
    Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to
the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at
January 1, 1987.
    Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in
buoyant response to the results and share split proposal,
though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers
added.

<TITLE>U.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7
pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of
0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.

<TITLE>COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>This morning's sharp decline in coffee
prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations
in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,
ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.
    "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the
failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it
will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices
rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters
said.
    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee
available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.
    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the
news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to
around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.
    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries
said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of
consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota
reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be
reallocated on a more equitable basis.
    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because
the market is well balanced and we must not lose this
opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.
    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of
clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not
welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete
renegotiation," de Vries added.
    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have
fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the
foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a
hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices
were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> TO ACQUIRE 40 LONG-RANGE JET AIRCRAFT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp's American Airlines said it
will buy 40 long-range jet aircraft to support international
expansion, including routes in the Caribbean.
    Under one agreement, the airline said, it will acquire 15
Boeing Co &lt;BA> 767-300 planes. Under a separate agreement,
American will acquire A-300-600 aircraft from &lt;Airbus
Industrie>, a European consortium.
    The company's announcement included no value for the order.
    Published reports put the value of the aircraft order,
including engines, at 2.5 billion dlrs.
    A total of 98 General Electric Co &lt;GE> CF6-80C2 engines is
involved in the orders, American Airlines said.
    The published reports valued the engines at five mln dlrs
each.
    The company said it will acquire the planes and engines
using rental leases that can be terminated on relatively short
notice.
    The arrangement allows the airline to acquire the planes
without adding to its debt, it explained.
    The Boeing 767s, to be delivered from February 1988 to
October 1988, will be used on routes between the U.S. and
Europe, American said.
    It said the Airbus A300s, scheduled for delivery from April
1988 through June 1989, will be assigned to the Caribbean,
where American has developed a major new hub at San Juan,
Puerto Rico.

<TITLE>HEINZ INTERESTED IN BUYING GUINNESS BREWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.J. Heinz &lt;HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reilly
would be interested in buying Guinness PLC &lt;GUIN.L>'s brewery
division if it were for sale, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,
said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the
brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together
a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."
    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as
saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that
he had the support of two international banks if he decided
such a purchase might be worthwhile.
    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing
profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,
the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.
    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for
the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he
said.
    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,
but not impossible," he added.
    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and
Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an
integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said.

<TITLE>EQUATORIAL COMMUNICATIONS &lt;EQUA> TO HAVE LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Equatorial Communications
Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>, raised its
pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln
stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985.
    Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from
4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost
operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.
    BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional
items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.
    Chief executive David Kendall said improved results
mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in
recent years.
    However, he warned future financial pressure on the
industry will be severe.
    "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to
invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a
good many years," he said in a statement.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.
