<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE CALLS HIGHER JAPAN DEFENSE SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today supported a call for
Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of
protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the
world, including in the Gulf.
    House member approved a measure that would require
Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan
on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of
its gross national product.
    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89
State Department funding bill would not require an increase,
but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. The
Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law.
    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show them
how to share the burden of the defense of the free world," said
Rep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.
    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with
Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two
alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on
defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the
United States as a kind of security fee.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's economy should manage modest
growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but
unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross
Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be
helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is
struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.
    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,
should again show growth over the next two years, rising by
0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.

<TITLE>SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MARJORIE SHAFFER, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Fildes, president and chief
executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
is not interested in buying Cetus.
    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
majority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement," said Fildes.
    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.
   
    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
over the next five years.
   
    "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mark Stahl, 45, who was a former senior
vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, until his
suspension on April 16, today admitted in U.S. District court
here, embezzling almost 19 mln dlrs from his firm over the past
year.
    He entered a guilty plea before United States District
Court Judge Vincent Broderick to four specific charges totaling
1,031,000 dlrs on wire fraud.
    Stahl, who was a senior vice president for finance, told
the judge that the total embezzlement amounted to "a little
less than" 19 mln dlrs.
   
    Through an attorney, Stahl agreed to make restitution to
Shearson Lehman of all the embezzled funds if possible. However
his guilty pleas today to the four counts will cover all
criminal liability of the embezzlement that occurred between
April 1986 to last April.
    Judge Broderick scheduled sentencing for December nine.
    Stahl faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail and one
mln dlrs in fines, or both.

<TITLE>CANADA TO INCREASE CORPORATE TAX REVENUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will increase corporate tax
revenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by
broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, finance
minister Michael Wilson said.
     As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations will
bear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to lower
overall tax rates.
     Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening
the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.
     "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income
tax system that is competitive with other countries,
particularly the United States," Wilson said in a prepared
speech to the House of Commons.
     "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable
corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," he
added.
     Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470
mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrs
in fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, according
to documents tabled with Wilson's speech.

<TITLE>CANADA FINANCIAL TAX RATE INCREASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The average tax rate for Canadian
financial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pct
under the new tax reform package, the federal finance
department said.
     The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed
will also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said in
documents tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson's
prepared speech to the House of Commons.
     Under Wilson's plan, the federal government will collect
1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial
insitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurance
companies, according to finance department documents.
     Financial institutions "are going to complain, but we
believe the changes are appropriate and affordable," said one
finance department official who asked not to be identified.
     Ottawa will collect more revenue from financial
institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct
from taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low tax
paying sector," the finance department said.
     Among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be able
to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses
that may be deducted for tax purposes.
     Effective June 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtful
loans during the year they are incurred.
     The finance department said the impact of the new
provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.
     The changes are needed to ensure that all financial
companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial
services industry.
     "It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue
to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions
competing in the same marketplace," the finance department
said.

<TITLE>OTTAWA WIDENS SALES TAX, STUDIES REPLACEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will broaden a federal sales tax
levied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of
a broad based, multi-staged sales tax, finance minister Michael
Wilson said.
     As expected, Wilson did not include a new sales tax system
as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of
Commons today.
    Instead, the federal government will make interim changes
to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and
middle income Canadians.
    "The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is a
hidden, arbitrary and capricious tax," Wilson told the House of
Commons.
    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian
economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than
imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that
makes them less competitive, Wilson said.
     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:
     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies
related to manufacturers
     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the
manufacturer for a selected range of products
     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication
services, except for residential telephone lines
     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.
     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,
refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50
dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the
finance department said.
     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new
sales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added
tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing
federal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the
House of Commons.
     He said the federal government will explore the
possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10
provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a
provincial sales of tax of varying amounts.
     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for
taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.
     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national
sales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will
consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.
     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to
virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include
further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle
income Canadians, the finance department said in documents
accompanying Wilson's speech.
     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax
systems, would also be broad based but would allow more
flexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the
department said. The finance deparment said the main drawback
of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and
costly to implement than the other two proposals.

<TITLE>FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
reform will not affect his determination to reign in
expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"
Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
forecast in the February budget.
    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
revenues.
    But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
transition to the reformed taxation system.
    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
billion dlrs in 1991.
    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
actual 3.1 pct.
    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around
the current four pct level over the next two years.

<TITLE>CANADA'S WILSON SETS NEW PREFERRED SHARE TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled a
ways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on
preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of
corporate tax revenue.
    Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financial
tax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued after
June 18 will be taxable.
    The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two
forms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a
subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, and
one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.
    "Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax
financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical
step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to
fund personal income tax reductions," Wilson explained.
    The minister said many profitable corporations, using
various deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes,
although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their
profits.

<TITLE>CANADA SETS WIDE-RANGING PERSONAL TAX CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveiled
a wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes
limiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the
dividend tax credit.
    With most changes effective at the first of next year,
Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets
from 10 to three.
    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two
billion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the
next five years.
    "Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two
far-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income tax
rates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax
credits," Wilson told the House of Commons.
    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500
dlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29
pct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum tax
rate is 34 pct under the current system.
    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said the
controversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be
reduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.
    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office
in 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it was
sharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to
wealthy investors.
    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on the
sale of farm land and for small businesess, however.
    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase
from 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.
    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to
25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest and
dividend income will be eliminated in 1988.
    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings
plan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the
increase in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed 
four years to 1994.

    The loss was a major personal setback for Gandhi whose

Delhi and a string of electoral losses since he took command of
the party in 1984.
    With 53 results in for Haryana's 90-seat assembly, Congress
had won only two seats against 63 previously. Before the poll,
Congress politicians in Delhi said privately that a loss in
Haryana could open a party leadership debate.

<DATELINE>    TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Circuit Court judge ordered
the company that insured the solvency of International Medical
Centres Inc to show cause why it should not honour its contract
with International, according to Florida's Department of
Insurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.
    As previously reported, International, the largest health
maintenance organisation in Florida was declared insolvent on
May 14. Federal regulators had also told the company its
Medicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of the
company's financial and management problems.
    Michelle McLawhorn, Florida Department spokeswoman, said
International's insurer, State Mutual Life Assurance Co of
America, had made clear it would fight activation of the policy
because International did not provide it with accurate
financial records. State Mutual could not be reached for
comment.
    McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditors
International had or how big its debt was. The court gave State
Mutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to pay
claims against the solvency policy.

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New U.S. Banking data suggest the
Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
said.
    But they also said that if money supply growth remains
weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
policy.
    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
economists said.
    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
as better gauges of economic growth.
    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end
of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."
    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
borrowings target would probably have been reached.
    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
easing at some point," he said.
    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of
years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
falling apart and the Fed should ease."
    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
policy.
    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
off econmomic growth.
    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a
fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
them more room to ease," he said.

warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the
U.S. For growth.
    "Given the importance of exports, particularly export
manufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have
to work hard to diversify your markets," he said.
    "While you may be able to maintain your current market share
in the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S.
To take major increases in your exports," he added.
    Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S.
Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many
now believed.
    He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not
necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being
contemplated by Congress, "but simply because of the adjustments
the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our
large and growing external debt."
    Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling
exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA'S OPPOSITION FACES SETBACK ON TAX PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Francis Daniel, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The conservative opposition, already
fighting an uphill election battle, now faces controversy in
its own ranks over a possible error in its major tax cutting
program, economists said.
    Professor Michael Porter, architect of the tax plan,
declined to refute Treasurer Paul Keating's charge that the
opposition miscalculated tax and expenditure cuts by several
billion dollars. Economists said the opposition, trailing
behind Labour in opinion polls, would find its chances further
diminished if its tax policy was a miscalculation.
    The tax plan, unveiled by opposition leader John Howard
last week, is the cornerstone of the Liberal Party's economic
strategy to oust the Labour Party in the July 11 poll.
    Keating has said the Howard tax plan would sharply increase
the budget deficit to more than nine billion dlrs and severely
damage Australia's economy, already overburdened with balance
of payments and foreign debt problems.
    In his mini-budget on May 13, Keating said the budget
deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and
three billion dlrs.
    Porter, a key member of the opposition economic think tank,
said he played a leading role in formulating the tax plan but
not Howard's proposed expenditure savings, which Keating
claimed were distorted through double counting.
    Some opposition members said there appeared to be errors,
but a Liberal Party spokesman refused comment, saying the
package was being reexamined.
    "The whole thing is so deceitful," Prime Minister Bob Hawke
said in a radio interview. "Howard has made a mess of it. If
they can't govern themselves, how can they expect to govern the
country?"
    Hawke, who is seeking a third term, said the opposition had
made the election one of the easiest for him.
    "I've never felt more physically and mentally relaxed
(during an election). We've no problems at all," he said.
    The latest public opinion poll, published in the Melbourne
Sun newspaper, showed Labour was leading the opposition by 12
points, indicating a 66-seat majority for Hawke in parliament.
    The Election Commission announced last night that 613
candidates would contest the 148-seat House of Representatives,
while 255 candidates would fight for the 76 Senate seats.

<TITLE>INDONESIA RAISES STAKE IN ALUMINIUM PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia has increased its share in a
434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from
25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud
said.
    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised
its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,
capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen
in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24
billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between
1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen
debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation
of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in
dollars.
    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to
about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if
prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.
    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a
year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,
situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE STOCKS SOAR TO NEW HIGHS, RECORD VOLUME</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg Hutchinson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investors on Philippine stock markets
have shrugged off growing communist activity in the cities to
push share prices to all-time highs on record turnover, brokers
said.
    Regularly heavy trading of more than one billion shares a
day has sent the Manila exchange's composite index soaring to
775.9 from 577.2 points in just over three weeks.
    Brokers described recent trading as "frantic" and "hectic" as
trading records were smashed day after day.
    A total 2.6 billion shares worth 259.4 million pesos
changed hands on the main Manila and the less important Makati
exchanges yesterday, with much of the activity among centavo
priced stocks, brokers said. The turnover was more than double
the record of 1.1 billion shares worth 118.1 million pesos set
on Wednesday.
    Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares to
shoot up three weeks ago, and other sectors followed. Share
prices continued their rise even when the gold price fell back
to 450 dlrs an ounce, due to rising confidence in President
Corazon Aquino's handling of the economy, they said.
    Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communist
insurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates
also contributed to the rise.
    Blue chip stocks, such as those of San Miguel Corp and
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), have risen 25 pct
in three weeks, and the trend is upward in the medium term
although a temporary correction is overdue, they said.
    Since the surge began on May 26, Manila's Mining index has
risen to 5,700.4 points from 4,042.4, its commercial and
industrial index has shot up to 881.0 from 694.9 points, and
the oils indicator has increased to 4.1 from 2.9 points.
    Market activity has been rising in spurts since Ferdinand
Marcos was replaced by Aquino 16 months ago.
    One broker said he thought the Philippine stock market "may
at last have come of age."
    Wilson Sy, president of Prudential Securities, a local
stockbroking firm with Hong Kong affiliations, told Reuters,
"Barring any unforeseen political events you can bet on the
Philippine market. It has shrugged off the communist inroads
into Manila."
    Assassins have killed 52 policemen, soldiers and security
guards in the capital this year.
    Communist hitmen known as sparrows have claimed they killed
22 of them.
    Sy said Philippine stocks were undervalued in world terms
with price-earnings ratios often half those in Hong Kong and
one-sixth those in Japan. He said PLDT, which is also U.S.
Listed, has a price-earnings ratio of about nine.
    Sy predicted Manila's composite index would rise beyond
1,000 points from its current 775.9 mark by year-end.
    Other brokers were more cautious, saying Aquino had to
improve peace and order before investors could treat the
Philippines as they would Hong Kong or Tokyo.
    One broker said he believed about 30 pct of the money going
into stocks was now foreign, much of it from fund managers and
their agents based in Hong Kong and New York.
    Manila Stock Exchange chairman Robert Coyuito told Reuters,
"If the peace and order situation really improved the market
could move beyond a price-earnings ratio of 20 times."
    "But all depends on how Congress performs and the local
elections go," he said.
    A new two-chamber legislature was elected last month and is
due to sit on July 27. Local elections are scheduled for
November.
    PLDT shares closed at 630 pesos a share yesterday, 30 pesos
above Wednesday's record close. PLDT share prices have risen
about nine-fold in 18 months.
    San Miguel shares closed at 190 pesos, also a historic
high, brokers said.

<TITLE>CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's sweeping tax reform package,
announced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,
but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some had
expected, economists and business leaders said.
    "It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in a
great many years," Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economist
Michael Manford told Reuters.
    "But the system is the same old system with a lot of
important changes, as opposed to a brand new system," he added.
(See spotlight index page on ECRA)
    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister Michael
Wilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal tax
system. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary
reform.
    "Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we
were led to believe," he said.
    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations
while cutting individual taxes "is probably an acceptable shift,"
said Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an
international mining company.
    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across
the corporate sector, James said. "So it's not going to hit
anyone too hard and we will remain competitive."
    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that
Canada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with
sweeping reforms in the United States last year.
    "The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson
moved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System," Manford
said.
    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations
by about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but
lowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.
    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to
lower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many
special tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.
    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used
by companies to write off major investments, which some
business spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.
    "That will affect some investment decisions negatively," said
Laurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association
president.
    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several
days to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance
reductions that will be made over a number of years.
    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they
intend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in
Parliament over the next few months.
    "It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab," said Liberal leader
John Turner.
    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax "a money
machine for the minister of finance."
    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include
additional products and also promised to introduce a
broad-based, multi-staged sales tax.
    "It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to
see that very quickly," New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent
said.
    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to
protect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that
will cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.

<TITLE>TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-Kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent government moves to curb capital
inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
U.S. Dollar.
    Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is much
slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."
He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
Dlrs a month between January and May.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
pct of the value of a contract.
    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
importers and exporters.
    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
to eight cents in May.
    The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
demand.
    They said they expected the government to keep the local
dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
September 1985.
    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
unchanged from yesterday.
    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
is quite successful."
    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
imports of machinery and production equipment because of
exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

<TITLE>JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help
financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and
Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade
Industry (MITI) said.
    Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia Asahan
Aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested
in the company. The government and private interests will
equally share the additional investment, he said.
    They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in
new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in
Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.
    The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to
Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the
official said.
    Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two
projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the
current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be
reached, industry sources said.
    Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion
yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32
billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's
investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.
    The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an
additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now
totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51
pct, the official said.
    The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects
were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to
help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to
stabilise sources of aluminium.
    Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its
aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they
said.

<TITLE>JAPAN REPORT SAYS FAULTY REPAIRS CAUSED JAL CRASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Faulty repairs and inadequate inspection
caused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd &lt;JAPN.T> (JAL)
Boeing 747 which killed 520 people, the Japanese government
said in a final official report.
    The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by the
Boeing Co &lt;BA>, said Shun Takeda, the ministry of transport
official leading the accident investigation committee.
    But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectors
for failing to carry out a full check of the repairs before
signing the clearance sheet.
    The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka, north of Tokyo, on August
12, 1985, after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabin
from the unpressurised tail suddenly burst, fracturing key
navigation systems. Only four people survived.
    A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report.
Boeing is expected to release a statement later today.
    The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility.
    In a separate set of recommendations, the investigators
said large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safe
systems, but did not say how this should be done.
    A press statement by a group of lawyers representing
victims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing in
greater depth with the fail-safe aspect.
    The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crash
was due to design defects by specifying two design
modifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed in
King County, Washington, Superior Court last March 24.
    They said similar official recommendations for fail-safe
systems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft,
near Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979, had been rejected
after objections from aircraft manufacturers.
    The government investigators asked the ministry to
formulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors. An internal
ministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were
left too much on their own when making aircraft checks.
    A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead
under JAL supervision, and Transport Ministry inspectors
approved the repairs without actually seeing them, today's
report said.
    The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because
the part repaired had been covered by a seal, the report said.
    Over time, cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of
metal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead.
    Boeing issued an official statement on September 6, 1985,
saying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty. It did
not link them with the crash.

excluding shipbuilding, fell 10.4 pct in April from March to a
seasonally adjusted 663.8 billion yen, after rising 17.6 pct in
March, the government's Economic Planning Agency said.
    April orders rose 2.0 pct from a year earlier after a 22.6
pct year-on-year rise in March, an agency spokesman told
Reuters.
    Seasonally adjusted private sector orders, excluding those
for shipbuilding and electric power firms, fell 7.5 pct in
April from March to 517.4 billion yen, after a 5.7 pct rise in
March from February.
    April orders fell 1.3 pct from a year earlier after being
unchanged in March.
    The April drop was due mainly to a 12.9 pct decrease in
orders from machine tool industries and a 15.3 pct drop in
orders from car makers, the spokesman said.

<TITLE>U.S. SEEKS JAPAN HELP IN EVENT OF 1988 RECESSION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Officials are looking to Japan
for help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an
American recession next year, Japanese government sources said.
    During a visit to the U.S. Earlier this month, Economic
Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both U.S. Federal
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers
chairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the U.S. Enters
recession next year.
    Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not
expect a recession next year, Volcker seemed to acknowledge
that an economic downturn was at least a possibility, the
sources said.
    Faced with with a huge budget deficit, the U.S. Has little
room to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn
that might occur in 1988.
    It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned
because U.S. Inflation is already showing some signs of picking
up, one source said.
    But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to
help counteract a U.S. Recession without running the risk of
overstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation,
the sources said.
    Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are
at record low levels. In May, M-2 money supply plus
certificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 10.2
pct, well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct.
    Some government sources are also worried that the recently
announced 6,000 billion yen emergency economic package could
push up land prices and the construction sector's inflation.
    Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of
about 10 pct in April, but that could accelerate to 20 pct
later this year under the impact of the emergency package, one
source said.
    The 6,000 billion yen package was generally well received
in the U.S., Although U.S. Congressmen and businessmen told
Kondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly, sources
said.
    The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of
public works spending in the package was taking place
immediately, they said.
    U.S. Congressmen were particularly interested in how much
impact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade
imbalance, a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly,
given the many economic uncertainties involved, the sources
said.
    While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in
terms of volume, some Congressmen expressed concern that it was
not falling fast enough.
     But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further
rise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade
imbalance.

<TITLE>SAINSBURY'S TAKING CONTROL OF SHAW'S SUPERMARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>J Sainsbury Plc&lt;SNB.L> said it agreed to
take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a
combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a
share.
    Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said
its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln
common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30
dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.
    A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,
also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4
mln.
    The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept
the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0
pct.
    The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
&lt;Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to
finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
    Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in
Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced
sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the
end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.
    Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's
to 28.5 pct. In the year to March 21, it reported a rise in
pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that
increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion.
    Sainsbury shares had fallen five pence before the
announcement to 590p from last night's close but were unmoved
by news of the deal.

net profit in the year ending March 31, 1988, is expected to be
unchanged from a year earlier.
    The prediction assumes a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen and a
crude oil price of 18 dlrs a barrel, a company spokesman told
Reuters. Sales in 1987/88 are estimated at 15,100 billion yen,
up 2.3 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier reported group net profit of 20.07
billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1987, up 8.6 pct from a
year earlier, helped by a drop in sales and administration
costs and reduced interest charges.

1,000 dockworkers, Bangladesh Shipping Corp officials said.
    The navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two
ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of
grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials
said.
    A spokesman for the workers said they would continue their
strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay
and other benefits. The strike began on June 11.
    "Unloading of grains and other essential commodities started
normally after we called in navy personnel to help," a port
official told Reuters.
    "The strike has caused no serious dislocation," he said.
    The government meanwhile declared the port jobs an
"essential service" and said the strikers could be dismissed
unless they end the strike soon.

rice price if the official producer price is reduced next
month, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government's
Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters.
    Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should
receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due
to the strong yen and lower oil prices.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price
paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice
Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and
2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.

yet to see the official Japanese government report on the crash
of a Japan Air Lines (JAL) Boeing 747 in which 520 died.
    However, it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report
that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which
remained undetected during scheduled inspections.
    The final report, released today, said faulty repairs to
the plane in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by
Transport Ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash, the worst
single air disaster in aviation history.
    Boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could
occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it
had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for
planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again.

<TITLE>JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said.
    The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
basis were delayed.
    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
restructure their economies.
    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
during the seven-year period to 1993.
    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

<TITLE>JAPAN MUST TRY HARDER TO CUT SURPLUS - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan must try harder to reduce its trade
surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure,
Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.
    He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its
current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it
is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year
ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or
about 4.5 pct of GNP.
    The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the
government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's
current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.

<TITLE>SWISS URGE CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN BANK REGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The loopholes in Swiss banking supervision
must be closed in a step-by-step manner, Swiss National Bank
Vice-President Markus Lusser said.
    The integration of financial markets had blurred the
distinction between banks and bank-like finance companies, and
the varying degree of regulation of the two sectors had a
destablizing effect, he told the Association of Foreign Banks.
    "It is in the interest of all market participants that these
institutes (finance companies) be brought as soon as possible
under banking supervision," he said in remarks prepared for
delivery to the association's annual meeting.
    It was important, however, that bringing finance companies
under the banking law did not undermine Switzerland as a
financial marketplace, Lusser said.
    "It is decisive for its future that it succeeds in
attracting and holding a wide variety of banks, financial
intermediaries and financial experts," he said.
    Lusser also urged greater harmonization of regulatory
practice with other countries in view of the integration of
world markets and the internationalization of the banking
business.

<TITLE>TOKYO STOCKS SEEN HEADING FOR POSSIBLE CORRECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tokyo stock market will probably not
make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary
correction, brokers said.
    Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount
rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm
against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of
uncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.
    "Everybody is just trying to think through things and see
exactly what is going on," said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co
Ltd. "There is a lot of confusion," he added.
    This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock
prices over the last two days. Today the 225-share average
ended 462.43 points lower at 25,288.12.
    "People expect a correction next week. They don't care if
the market falls to 24,000," the Sanyo broker said. "There is
always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any
correction."
    Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull
run to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts money
from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of
borrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.
    "Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfolios
to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more
exporters," said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.
    Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is
unlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincing
stock market investors to buy electronics, precision
instrument, machinery and some other export-oriented
manufacturing shares, brokers said.
    "Some people are awaiting the results of proposed
protectionist U.S. Trade legislation in July for clues to the
currency direction," a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said.

<TITLE>THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's major tin exporter and
producer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said
it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of
insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.
    Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to
Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than
20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne
average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.
    He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let
the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported
tin lapse on June 3.
    The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this
month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower
levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid
the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.
    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a
large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100
tonnes per day.
    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some
3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by
the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year
ending February 1988.
    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to
allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.
    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,
because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral
Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late
this month, Yoot said.
    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin
during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.

<TITLE>OLYMPUS SEES 12 PCT RISE IN 1986/87 CURRENT PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Olympus Optical Co Ltd &lt;OOPT.T> predicted
parent company current profit of 5.50 billion yen in the year
ending October 31, 1987, up 12 pct from a year earlier,
assuming a yen/dollar rate of 147 yen in the second half, a
company spokesman told Reuters.
    Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 122 billion yen, up 0.9
pct from a year earlier.
    But net profit will fall 71.7 pct to three billion yen in
1986/87 from a year earlier when the company made a 10.59
billion net profit due to sales of real estate assets worth
seven billion yen, the spokesman said.
    The precision instrument maker will retain 13 yen dividend
for 1986/87, the spokesman said.
    It earlier reported parent company net profit of 1.34
billion yen in the six months ended April 30, down 85.5 pct
from a year earlier, on sales of 60.92 billion, down 0.1 pct.
    The poor net was mainly due to a fall to 45 mln yen in
extraordinary profit in the first half, against 7.70 billion of
such profit a year earlier, due mainly to sales of assets.
    The drop in first half sales was due to the yen's rise
against the dollar, which cut sales by some 4.30 billion yen.
    The dollar averaged 157 yen, against 192 a year earlier.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Isuzu Motors Ltd &lt;ISUM.T> forecast a
parent company net loss of 15 billion yen in the year ending
October 31, 1987 against a 3.98 billion loss a year earlier,
 assuming a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen, a spokesman said.
    Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 910 billion yen, down
10.2 pct from a year earlier.
    The automaker earlier reported a parent company net loss of
12.92 billion in the six months ended April 30, 1987, against a
1.65 billion yen profit a year earlier, on sales of 443.90
billion, down 15.9 pct from a year earlier.
    The poor first half performance was due to the yen's rise
against the dollar which cut 84.27 billion yen off sales, the
spokesman said.
    The average yen/dollar rate rose to 158 yen in the first
half from 207 a year earlier.
    First half car exports fell to 68,445 from 82,093 a year
earlier, mainly due to drop in exports to the U.S., While
domestic sales rose to 30,643 from 29,836.
    Truck exports fell to 108,782 from 127,903 because a
two-year contract to sell a total of 40,000 trucks to China
ended last year and domestic sales fell to 55,925 from 61,954.
    The company estimated sales at 207,000 cars in 1986/87,
down 5.2 pct from a year earlier, and 339,000 trucks, down 9.8
pct, the spokesman said.
    He gave no estimate of exports.

<TITLE>SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
    They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
now awaiting its approval.
    CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
government selling price.
    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
C.Itoh.
    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.
    The South African central bank said in its quarterly
bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January
to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.
    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the
third and fourth quarters of last year.
    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement
reached with international creditors in March as evidence of
improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.
    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term
foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised
surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of
7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus
of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth
consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Net receipts of U.K. Building societies
in May fell to 521 mln stg from 727 mln in April and compared
with 500 mln in May 1986, figures from the Building Societies
Association show.
    Association director-general Mark Boleat said in a
statement he was satisfied with the May figure in view of the
calls for investors funds' generated by the privatisation of
Rolls-Royce Plc and the approaching second call on the
partly-paid British Gas Plc shares.
    Boleat said the recently announced cut in mortgage rates
suggests a continuation of buoyant demand. He noted that
building society net receipts usually decline seasonally as
summer approaches.
    The British Gas second call fell on June 9, affecting
building society inflows in both May and June.
    Gross retail receipts in May, unadjusted for withdrawals,
were 7.46 billion stg against 6.63 mln in April and 5.60
billion in May last year.
    The net inflow of funds from the wholesale market in May
was 317 mln stg against 188 mln in April and 249 mln in May
1986.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese oil companies are starting
campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
said.
    Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
    Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
    Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
    "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
consumption," Showa Shell said.
    Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
    High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
    Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
    Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
sales.
    The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
construction in the next two to three years.
    "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
    An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
companies increase their international competitiveness.
    Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
    Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
from the previous year, according to a MITI report.

and labelling operations, a spokeswoman said.
    She gave no dates or prices for the transaction but said
the units would be sold by negotiation.
    She declined to give any turnover or profit figures for the
packaging and labelling operations, beyond saying that they
were very profitable. They formed a self-contained part of the
overall group, she said.
    Analysts said the packaging and labelling division could be
sold for up to 150 mln stg.
    Earlier this week group chairman Robert Maxwell also said
it expected to float its Mirror group newspaper subsidiary,
bought from  Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L> for 100 mln stg in
1984.
    The spokeswoman said that BPCC intended to keep a majority
share in the newspaper group if it was floated.
    BPCC is currently locked in legal battles resulting from
its attempt to take over U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ>. Earlier this week, BPCC launched a
two-for-three rights issue to raise 640 mln stg and said the
money raised would enable it to renew its assault on Harcourt.
It has also expressed interest in Dutch publisher Kluwer NV

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES APPROVES NEW CAR PROGRAMME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippines' Board of Investments (BOI)
has approved new guidelines on making cars but is still
awaiting rules on the tax component of the programme, trade and
industry secretary Jose Concepcion said.
    He said the authorities were still deciding how much tax
will be levied on locally-assembled cars.
    The new car development programme replaces an earlier
scheme and is designed to limit the number of car manufacturers
in the local market.
    The scheme is to be unveiled before the end of the month.
    The two accredited local car manufacturers are &lt;Pilipinas
Nissan Inc>, which gets car kits from Nissan Motor Company Ltd
&lt;NSAN.T> and &lt;Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> which
gets supplies from Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>.
    Three companies which pulled out due to what they saw as
poor market conditions were Ford Philippines, a subsidiary of
Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, General Motors Pilipinas, a subsidiary of
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> and &lt;Delta Motors Corp>.
    Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, which was the foreign partner
of Delta Motors, has applied for a place in the new programme
and is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant.
    Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be
allowed to operate, but said they will be required to finance
75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import
completely-knocked-down kits.
    The balance will be provided by the central bank, he said.
    The trade minister, who is also chairman of the BOI, said
the programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by
requiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts. He said
the plan should keep car prices at "reasonable levels."
    Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a
car.

yesterday, an EC Commission spokesman said.
    However, he said he could not rule out such a meeting
altogether, noting the decision is one for Belgium, which
currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers.
    The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the
meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and
30, diplomats noted.
    The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg
still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with
West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key
aspects of EC Commission proposals, the actual common price
changes and a revision of the "green money" system.
    The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to
appear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days giving
notice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measures
from July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord.
    However, Commission sources said this notice would not
detail the measures to be taken, which, they said, might be
considered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting next
Wednesday.
    The Commission published a declaration by EC Farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg early
yesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting.
    In it, Andriessen said there was now a serious threat to
the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Andriessen added ,"The Commission...Will take the measures
which are necessary, not only for the temporary management of
the markets, but also for a healthy finance policy."
    "This means that the protective measures we are going to
apply will necessarily have, in the context of our own powers,
a dynamic character," he said.

after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between
the two countries.
    The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the

where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.
    The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be
repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and
Xingang last month.
    Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding

Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600
ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China's yards offered
competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.

<TITLE>TRACOMIN SEES LOWER U.S. EDIBLE GROUNDNUT EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Exports of edible
groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to
September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading
company Tracomin SA said.
    It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would
total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.
Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and
the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a
premium in the U.S. Domestic market.
    Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop
at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.
    Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop
and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.
    "Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in
1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the
reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of
peanuts," it said.
    Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,
will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite
quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some
earlier high-priced contracts. It is too early to say if China
can retain its current market share in 1988, Tracomin said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Budget Director James Miller
said President Reagan would veto the Democrat-controlled
Congress' new budget plan out of hand -- but offered to
compromise on raising revenues.
    "If that budget comes down it will vetoed out of hand, I can
tell you that," Miller said on a morning television show.
    He said Reagan would not accept the 19 bln dlr tax increase
in Congress' proposal but said "keep in mind the president has
proposed certain revenues in his budget.
    "They're not taxes," Miller said. "They are user charges and
asset sales. I think there is some room there we can sit down
and talk with the Democrats about."
    Miller said he believed a compromise could be worked out
but he said the administration would need assurance that
whatever compromise it accepted would indeed by passed by
Congress.
    Miller also said in the interview that he did not believe
the new U.S. protection of 11 Kuwaiti tanker ships in the
Persian Gulf would require a supplemental request to Congress
later for more defense money.

<TITLE>MOULINEX SHARES FALL TO 1987 LOW ON PARIS BOURSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French domestic appliance maker Moulinex
&lt;MOUP.PA> shares continued to fall on the Paris Bourse reaching
its year's low amid controversy over an auditor's report on
1987 profit forecasts, dealers said.
    A Moulinex spokesman said a "mutilated" copy of the report by
Paris auditors Syndex, which gave a poor impression of the
company's prospects, had caused the stock to fall sharply.
    Meanwhile, Moulinex said in a communique that it stood by
its April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 41.7
mln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986.

    The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report,
commissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee, had been
circulated to several Parisian stockbrokers.
    The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would be
difficult to achieve, thereby causing Moulinex stock to drop
almost 13 francs in two days to 75.10 francs per share.
    A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were
"shocked" by the leak of a confidential document and attributed
it to "malicious intentions." Several Paris brokers said it was
likely that corporate "raiders" interested in a takeover bid had
put out the Syndex report to bring down the share price.

    Moulinex shares have fluctuated considerably since the
beginning of the year on takeover rumours, reaching a high of
122 francs.
    Group president Jean Mantelet, who is 87, said in February
that he intended to transfer his 42 pct stake in Moulinex to
the company's employees. However, a company statement issued at
the same time said a management buy-out was only one of several
options.
    The rest of the group's equity has been held by private
investors since March when &lt;Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Sold its
20 pct holding in the company.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS LOW U.K. UNIT WAGE COSTS HELP EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports
but wage rises are "faster than is comfortable."
    He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises
were wrong, saying OECD predictions "are somewhat unreliable."
    "Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even though
wages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unit
cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said in
answer to questions on BBC radio.
    "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in
export markets, for example, but we could do even better and
get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate
rate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added.
    His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying
average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, up
from March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Government
bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.
    Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts
for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the
economy.
    Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic
rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next
budget due in March 1988.
    "We will certainly achieve it sooner or later," he said.
    The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unit
wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct
annually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2
pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's
first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct.
    However, analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate
somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year.

<TITLE>SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JEDDAH, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.

    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
organisation decided to cut production again from last
September onwards.
    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
official Saudi Press Agency.
    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
report said.
    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
around 750,000 bpd last year.

    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
per day, the report said.
    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

offering of three mln currency exchange warrants of Ford Motor
Co's Ford Motor Credit unit is underway at 4.375 dlrs each.
    Each warrant allows the holder to receive from Ford Credit
the cash value in U.S. dollars of the right to purchase 50 dlrs
at a price of 7,610 yen. Bear Stearns said the spot exchange
rates of the yen and dollar will determine whether the warrants
have a cash value on a given day.
    It said the warrants will have a cash settlement value only
if the dollar is worth over 152.20 yen.
    The company said if a warrant has not been exercised, and
at its expiration the value of the dollar is not more than
152.20 yen, the warrant will expire with no cash settlement
value.
    It said the warrants will be exercisable immediately and
expire in five years, and any warrant not exercised before then
will be automatically exercised on July 1, 1992.
    Bear Stearns said this is the second time a currency
warrant issue has been sold in the U.S., the first being a two
mln warrant issue for General Electric Co's &lt;GE> General
Electric Credit Corp unit on June 10.

    He said Reagan would not accept the 19 billion dlr tax
increase in Congress' proposal but said "keep in mind the

    "They're not taxes," Miller said. "They are user charges and

<TITLE>COURT ORDERS INT'L MEDICAL INSURER TO SHOW CAUSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Circuit Court judge ordered
the company that insured the solvency of International Medical
Centres Inc to show cause why it should not honour its contract
with International, according to Florida's Department of
Insurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.
    As previously reported, International, the largest health
maintenance organization in Florida, was declared insolvent on
May 14. Federal regulators had also told the company its
Medicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of the
company's financial and management problems.
    Michelle McLawhorn, Florida Insurance Department
spokeswoman, said International's insurer, State Mutual Life
Assurance Co of America, had made clear it would fight
activation of the policy because International did not provide
it with accurate financial records.
    State Mutual could not be reached for comment.
    McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditors
International had or how big its debt was. The court gave State
Mutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to pay
claims against the solvency policy.

<TITLE>CANADA POSTAL UNION PREPARED TO REJECT NEW OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada Post presented its striking
letter carriers with a new contract offer today but both sides
said there was little indication the offer would end an
increasingly violent three-day-old walkout.
    The strike has been especially bitter in Quebec, where the
federally regulated postal service has brought in replacement
workers in contravention of provincial laws that prohibit
hiring strikebreakers.
    Canada Post said letter carriers in Chicoutimi and
Jonquiere, Quebec, damaged mail sorting rooms, ripped out
telephone lines and letter racks, overturned furniture and
threw mail on the floor before walking out to join carriers in
other cities on the picket line.
    The rotating strike spread today to the Atlantic provinces
and Vancouver. Carriers remained off the job in Edmonton and
Vancouver while postal employees went back to work in Montreal,
Calgary, and Cornwall, Ontario.
    About 20 people were arrested in Eastern Canada as strikers
scuffled with police called in to escort replacement workers
across picket lines.
    Letter Carriers Union of Canada President Robert McGarry
said the new offer to the union's 20,000 members contained only
minor changes and did not soften the agency's demand for
concessions.
    Canada Post officials said the agency is limited by federal
guidlines which order the agency to eliminate its 160 mln dlrs
deficit by next year.

Chrysler will tender 27 dlrs a share for 100 pct of the
Richardson, Texas-based defense electronics contractor.
    It said total cost to Chrysler to buy all of the
outstanding stock would be about 367 mln dlrs.
    Electrospace Systems designs, develops and installs
communications and electronic  systems and equipment for the
specialized needs of military and commercial customers
worldwide.
    Chrysler said Electrospace will help its Gulfstream
operations grow in military and commercial aircraft sales.
    But it said there are no plans to merge Gulfstream and
Electrospace. Rather, they will operate as "sister companies,"
it said.
    Chrysler said its tender offer is expected to begin by June
25 and will be managed by First Boston Corp.
    For the fiscal year ended April 3, 1987, Electrospace
Systems had earnings of 10 mln dlrs on sales of 191 mln dlrs.
The company employs 2,500 people. About 92 pct of its sales
were to the military.

<TITLE>OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LAGOS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman
said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be
brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"
Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
starts June 25.
    "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight
review," Lukman said.
    The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
dlrs a barrel.
    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
to keep the market stable.
    "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.
    He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
    "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
collective will to keep the market strong," he said.
    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks
ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this
was significant for its members.
    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year
when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a
restocking now for the winter was responsible for current
market strength.

<TITLE>BONN WILL HOLD TAX REFORM TIMETABLE, KOHL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German government will stick to
its agreed timetable and introduce tax cuts worth 44 billion
marks from 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said.
    Kohl told a news conference, "The tax reform will be
realised as agreed by the coalition after the (last general)
election" in January.
    He said the leadership of his own Christian Democratic
party repeated its support for the tax reform timetable at a
meeting this week. CDU vice-chairman Lothar Spaeth also
reiterated his doubts about whether the reform was feasible as
planned, but received no support from other party members, he
added.
    Kohl said the government intends to decide by the autumn
how to raise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance
the tax reform.
    Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the main target for
trimming to pay for the tax reform.
    But politicians both inside and outside the government have
expressed doubts about making politically painful cuts in
subsidies.

<TITLE>TVA CUSTOMERS ASK COURT REQUIRE DOE PAYMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An organization of Tennessee
Valley Authority industrial customers said it has joined the
TVA in asking a court to prevent the U.S. Department of Energy
from witholding contracted payments to TVA.
    The Tennessee Valley Industrial Committee said it is
seeking permission to intervene in TVA's federal district court
lawsuit requesting DOE be enjoined from witholding payments due
under "minimum demand" provisions of the TVA's contract to
supply electricity to uranium enrichment facilities at Oak
Ridge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky.
   
    Such provisions obligate TVA to make available a certain
amount of power and the customer -- in this case the DOE --
agrees to pay the fixed costs associated with that amount of
power whether is is used or not.
    The committee represents 27 large, energy-intensive
industries with operations in the TVA service area. These
industries, like DOE, are served directly by TVA as opposed to
going through a local distributors.
    The TVA has said DOE's intention, announced last week, to
withhold increasing percentages of its electric bill will
result in a revenue shortfall of about 250 mln dlrs and force
an about six pct rate increase to all other customers.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate majority leader Robert Byrd
urged President Reagan to negotiate with the Democratic-led
Congress over budget matters.
    He told reporters that Reagan and Republicans failed to
help write the budget expected to get final congressional
approval next week.
    He said it was time for Reagan to move from his "hobby horse"
and get into the negotiations over tax and defence matters, the
two issues dividing Reagan and Democrats.
    Reagan has said he would veto any bill implementing the
suggested 19 billion dlrs in 1988 taxes in the budget.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's sweeping tax reform package,
announced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,
but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some had
expected, economists and business leaders said.
    "It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in a
great many years," Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economist
Michael Manford told Reuters.
    "But the system is the same old system with a lot of
important changes, as opposed to a brand new system," he added.
    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister Michael
Wilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal tax
system. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary
reform.
    "Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we
were led to believe," he said.
    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations
while cutting individual taxes "is probably an acceptable shift,"
said Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an
international mining company.
    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across
the corporate sector, James said. "So it's not going to hit
anyone too hard and we will remain competitive."
    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that
Canada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with
sweeping reforms in the United States last year.
    "The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson
moved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System," Manford
said.
    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations
by about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but
lowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.
    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to
lower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many
special tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.
    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used
by companies to write off major investments, which some
business spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.
    "That will affect some investment decisions negatively," said
Laurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association
president.
    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several
days to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance
reductions that will be made over a number of years.
    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they
intend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in
Parliament over the next few months.
    "It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab," said Liberal leader
John Turner.
    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax "a money
machine for the minister of finance."
    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include
additional products and also promised to introduce a
broad-based, multi-staged sales tax.
    "It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to
see that very quickly," New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent
said.
    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to
protect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that
will cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.

northern Europe recently is not a real problem for farmers yet,
a spokeswoman for France's largest farm union, FNSEA, said.
    The bad weather has only affected the northern part of
France while the Mediterranean region needs more moisture.
    Sugar beet producers said the climatic conditions are not
causing them any difficulties yet although there could be
problems if there is a lack of sun in the next few weeks.
    The only real problem is for fruit producers in the north
as people are consuming less fresh fruit and excessive rain
rots the crop, she said.

<TITLE>SUDAN BOOSTS BUDGET CASH FOR DEBT SERVICING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KHARTOUM, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs to
service foreign debts in 1987/88, according to budget plans
presented to parliament.
    This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debt
repayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debt
totalling 10.6 billion dlrs.
    Finance Minister Beshir Omar, presenting plans to
parliament last night, put the budget deficit at 2.88 billion
pounds, against 2.85 billion in 1986/87.
    He said the budget would be the first in a four-year
economic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December.
    Of the total set aside for debt servicing, Omar said 574.6
mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interest
payments.
    Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs,
Khartoum-based Western experts say.
    Omar said last March it would be difficult, "if not
impossible," for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17
billion dlrs over the next five years.
    He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears on
debt repayments in the first half of this year.
    The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt to
Western government creditors, 32 pct to governments of Eastern
bloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks, with
most of the rest owed to multilateral sources.
    Sudan, unable to fully service its debts since 1985 and
declared ineligible last year by the International Monetary
Fund for fresh loans, has been servicing only creditors banned
from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.
    Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9
billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds.
    He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans,
government deposits and other sources.
    Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidising

<TITLE>GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ACCRA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
programme.
    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern
Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."
    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
dried up.

<TITLE>U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of England governor Robin
Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could
jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in
Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are
more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than
for a good number of years.
    "It would surely be foolish to put that favourable
conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or
excessively," he said.
    "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the
risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of
high inflation," he added.
    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would
argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
investment in industry.
    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.

<TITLE>FAILURE OF EC FARM PRICE TALKS DISRUPTS TENDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>There will be no serious bids at European
Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC
farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade
sources said.
    The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an
agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export
subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the
uncertainty remains.
    One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be
avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation
will become more serious as time passes.
    However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,
lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.
    Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed
wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special
tenders, traders said.

share, but the company said it will record a profit for the
third quarter ending June 30.
    Federated said the elimination of the reserve will not
affect its ability to pay dividends to stockholders and will
have a minimal impact on annual profits for the fiscal year
ending Sept 30, 1987.
   
    Federated said the secondary reserve consists of previous
contributions to the FSLIC fund in excess of insurance
premiums, along with accumulated earnings on those
contributions.

<TITLE>U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
interest rates.
    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
trying to lock into cheap money.
    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
mortgage business.
    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
few years ago.
    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
induce them to retain their accounts.
    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"
said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
offering variable rate mortgages.
    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
more.
    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
new business, officials at all three institutions said.
    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
below those on the variable rate loans.
    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
new mortgage loans.
    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our
mortgage product."
    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting
that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
of its 1986 volume.
    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
lender is earning an above average return on assets.
    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
the benefit of cheap money.
    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
    Young explained that the company had planned to protect
itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
complicated hedging instrument.
    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
mortgages and hedge profitably.
    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
and selling them to an investor.
    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
over the past few years.

<TITLE>DUTCH TO MEET 1987 PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICIT TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch public authorities are on course
to meet the 1987 public sector deficit target of 7.9 pct of net
national income (NNI) despite excess spending by the central
government, according to a leaked official report.
    The so-called Spring Report, giving latest revenue and
expenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinet
today, was leaked in advance to the Dutch press. The Dutch
Finance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports.
    Newspapers quoted the report, drafted by Finance Minister
Onno Ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue would
compensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.
    Ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowing
requirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's target
at 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seek
additional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost
in revenue, the report was quoted as saying.
    Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8
billion guilders, while market factors accounted for another
300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.
    But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion,
including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in
income from natural gas sales.
    Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the
1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet has
already pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.
    The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further
austerity measures will be needed next year to keep the
government on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector
borrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI.
    Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal and
Christian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority in
parliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988
budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is likely to add
temporary reserves to the banking system this morning by
executing system repurchase agreements, economists said.
    The Fed faces a need to add a large volume of reserves this
statement period to offset a drain caused by rising Treasury
balances at the Fed after the June 15 tax date.
    Most economists are predicting over-the-weekend system
repurchases. But some, who see a smaller adding requirement,
are forecasting a less aggressive combination of three- and
six-day repos. Fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct, close to
yesterday's 6.81 pct average.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
withdrew the ratings on Caesars World Inc and unit Caesars
World Finance Corp.
    The action affects 230.8 mln dlrs of debt.
    Withdrawn were Caesars World's BB senior debt and B-plus
subordinated debt and the unit's B-plus subordinated debt.
    S and P said these issues are expected to be refinanced
when Caesars World implements a recapitalization plan. The
agency assigned a B-plus rating to Caesars World's proposed 330
mln dlr issue of seven-year senior notes and a B-minus grade to
its 330 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 1999.
    Standard and Poor's noted that the recapitalization plan of
Caesars World calls for the payment of a 26.25 dlr per share
dividend totaling 929.3 mln dlrs.
    The recapitalization plan will be financed by the
seven-year note and 12-year debenture issues, 300 mln dlrs in
bank and other debt, and by cash on hand, S and P noted.
    The agency said that Caesars World's debt will rise to 1.1
billion dlrs from about 319.2 mln on April 30 and the firm will
have stockholders' deficit of 508.8 mln dlrs. S and P said it
does not expect a meaningful reduction of debt for the next
several years.

<TITLE>SPAIN PLANS TARIFF OVERHAUL FOR POWER UTILITIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Hurst, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's socialist government is aiming to
restore confidence of foreign banks in its power generation
sector by pushing through a complete reform of the industry's
tariff structure, a senior government official said.
    Most foreign banks have been refusing to extend fresh loans
to the mainly privately-owned sector since Fuerzas Electricas
de Catalunya S.A. (FECSA), a major utility, defaulted on two
billion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year.
    Secretary of State for the Economy, Guillermo De la Dehesa,
told Reuters in an interview that a new government-inspired
tariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each year
would guarantee the long term viability of the industry.
    He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes
(parliament) this summer, enabling tariff increases from next
year to be set under the new system.
    De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of the
scheme, known here as the "Marco Estable" (stable framework), but
said future tariff increases would make up for the failure of
past adjustments to cover rising costs.
    "The utility companies have a captive market and if they are
assured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the best
of all possible worlds to do business in," De la Dehesa said.
    FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign and
Spanish bankers who expressed fears that other utility
companies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidence
in the industry's future is restored.
    Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts, with
short and medium term exposure of 4,377 billion pesetas at the
end of last year. A significant proportion of it is in foreign
currency, bankers say.
    The new tariff plan, currently being discussed with
representatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers,
would shortly be presented to foreign creditors, De la Dehesa
said.
    FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when the
stock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on the
grounds that it could not meet its debts.
     "FECSA was a special case," De la Dehesa said, "but the banks
took fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utility
sector. We really did not expect this."
    Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been on
the strength of a government commitment made to international
bankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support the
industry.
    "I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis of
declarations by our energy authorities in London, they will
have all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system is
passed into law," De la Dehesa said.
     "This is going to be a palpable fact, not just a
declaration," he added.
    De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence was
restored in the sector as a whole, FECSA's debt problems would
be quickly solved.
    A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA's
foreign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona on
Tuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailing
utility's debt.
    FECSA's General Manager, Jose Zaforteza, told Reuters he
thought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved by
the new tariff proposals.
    "You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electrical
utility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to cover
your costs," Zaforteza said.
    The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a U.S. Bank
which has lent money to FECSA said there would be little
significant progress in the rescheduling talks until details of
the tariff proposals were known.
    "We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to pay
its debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be," he
said.
    "If you make annual increases over a period of years of
four, five or six pct, in each case it's a completely different
ball game," he said.

<TITLE>EYSKENS WANTS 102.1 BILLION FRANC BELGIAN TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Mark Eyskens is
proposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 102.1
billion francs that would apply from 1989, a finance ministry
spokesman said.
    The package, one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawn
up by government officials, is expected to be discussed by
ministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can be
presented to parliament in October.
    The proposals, which would greatly simplify the country's
tax system, include a cut in withholding tax on investment
income earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct.
    The reduction would apply to income from risk capital, but
the spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include all
shares and bonds.
    The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable to
families with children than the present regime and would treat
spouses' incomes separately instead of combining them, a
practice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. The tax
reform does not encompass corporate taxation.
    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package
would be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances
currently granted to diverse interest groups.
    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues
resulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the
package.
    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,
which the government would have to decide how to cover, either
by raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.
    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgium
as a "fiscal Himalaya," is the least costly of the 11 scenarios
prepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,
of 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,
of which the highest is 71.6 pct.

<TITLE>U.S. COURT UPHOLDS APEX DECISION FAVORING NYMEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit
by Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange and
several oil companies.
    The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursue
anititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations
against Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp &lt;CGP>.
    Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several
companies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it
to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,
knowing Apex could not make full delivery.
   
    The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of
heating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apex
eventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.
    Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham
and Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to
pursue its case against Belcher Oil.
    The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against
Apex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and
15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEX
spokeswoman.

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian letter carriers today rejected a
new contract offer from Canada Post as the strike spread to
Toronto where half the nation's mail is sorted.
    The Letter Carriers Union said the new offer presented June
18 contained the same demands for concessions the union had
already refused.
    The union members walked out in other Ontario cities today
but returned to work in Atlantic Canada, parts of Quebec,
Edmonton, and Victoria. Negotiators were scheduled to resume
bargaining today but were not expected to reach an agreement to
end the four-day-old strike.

    Unions called the strike today and tomorrow morning to
press for shorter working hours and an eight pct pay increase.
Employers offered a 4.75 pct wage increase last month.

    The company, which today declared a regular quarterly

    The company said this pressure will be offset to a certain
extent by increased revenues from out-of-state operations and

<TITLE>GTE &lt;GTE> DEVELOPS METHOD FOR MAKING TRANSISTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WALTHAM, Mass., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>GTE Corp scientists said they
have discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistors
by creating an entirely new electronic material.
    The new method, they said, consists of simultaneously
"growing" metal connections and silicon crystals together to
form one, three dimensional device with connections penetrating
the entire device.
    Conventional transistors require many steps to make and
have connections only on the surface.
    GTE Laboratories created "an entirely new electronic
material and device form, which may open up a spectrum of uses
that cannot even be imagined at this time," said David Decker,
vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories.
    "Although still early in our research, we are obviously
excited that we have found a significantly simpler and, we
believe, cheaper way to produce an electronic device," he said.
    Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combining
and heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalum
disilicide, so that the two grow together.
    The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending
througout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistor
that should be superior to standard devics in high power
applications, the scientists said.
    They said that, because the connections extend vertically
througout the new device, it has a much greater volume of
active material than conventional surface-mounted connections.
    Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages of
their research on the device, but prototypes of the new device
compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and show
promise of superior performance.
    He said the prototype device also proved to be particularly
efficient in detecting light, which could open up new
possibilities in solar energy conversion, the development of
electronic cameras and greater efficiency in optical
communication systems.

<TITLE>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> MUM ON REED &lt;REED.L> RUMORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials
were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L>.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization," he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New
York said "there's no basis to think that it's us."

<TITLE>SALOMON BROTHERS HAS HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DEBENTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Brothers Inc said it has
acquired 21,978 convertible subordinated debentures of Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc, which it says could be converted into
21,978,000 common shares.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the New York brokerage firm said it bought the debentures,
which have a face value of 1,000 dlrs each, in May and June as
a regular part of its investment and arbitrage activities.
    The conversion rights of the debentures are the subject of
a Florida court case, in which Salomon Brothers said it has
also intervened.
    Salomon Brothers said it rejects Hartcourt's position that
the debentures are not convertible into stock as of June 9.
    It said it would leave open a range of options regarding
the debentures, including buying more, selling some or all of
their current stake in the market or in negotiated deals,
talking with other Harcourt security holders, surrendering the
debentures if there were a merger or tender offer or converting
them into stock.
    Salomon said it would have a 35.8 pct stake in Harcourt,
based on 39.4 mln shares outstanding, if it converted the
debentures into 21,978,000 common shares. The percentage is
based on the current outstanding plus the amount of stock that
would be issued in a conversion.
    But Salomon said its stake in Harcourt's common stock would
be lower if other debentureholders converted their securities
into stock. It says it has no idea of the total number of
debentures outstanding.
    Harcourt has said that Salomon and Mutual Shares Corp, a
New York investment firm, hold a combined total of 30 mln dlrs
of debentures.
    Harcourt announced a recapitalization plan last month to
ward off a takeover attempt by British publisher Robert
Maxwell.

<TITLE>S. AFRICA CITICORP STAFF CHALLENGE DISINVESTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South African staff of the U.S.
Bank Citicorp &lt;CCI> said they will challenge its plans to sell
local operations and withdraw from the country.
    Employees said they had written to Citicorp chief executive
John Reed protesting against the way the disinvestment deal has
been handled. They said that they were not consulted on the
sale of Citicorp's local subsidiary, Citibank N.A. Ltd, to
South Africa's First National Bank &lt;BCLJ.J>.
    The letter, signed by most of the bank's 175 staff, hints
at legal action against Citicorp unless it reviews the
disinvestment arrangement.
    "We are seriously considering legal action," a senior
Citibank employee told Reuters. "There has been no consultation
with South African staff and that runs contrary to American
corporate thinking in this country," he added.
    Citicorp announced the 130 mln rand cash sale on Tuesday
with an effective date of July 1.
    First National Bank's managing director, Chris Ball, said
his bank was essentially buying the skills of Citibank's
specialist employees and disclosed that the American bank's
assets in South Africa totalled only 15 mln rand.
    Ball indicated that the bank's staff had been told of the
sale and agreed to stay on in the bank's employ.
    Citibank's staff, 40 pct of whom are black, have complained
that the disinvestment accord bars local employees from jobs
with Citicorp anywhere in the world for five years.
    They say that this provision amounts to a restraint clause
which is legally challengeable. This could threaten the
divestment plan, say industry sources, since most of the
purchase price, as Ball said, is for employee skills and
expertise and not assets.
    The Citibank employee challenge is seen as more important
than a previous, ultimately unsuccessful, challenge on job
security issues by General Motors employees after the U.S.
Automaker announced its pull out, because valuable managers and
other key staff are involved in protest.
    The employees assert that the Citicorp sale, unlike similar
disinvestment moves announced this week by &lt;Ford Motor Co> and
&lt;ITT Corp>, include no portion of South African profits for
local employees or black community projects.
    "We always thought they would offer a settlement to staff
here in keeping with their image as an equal opportunity
employer," said a senior black employee, adding "We had no idea
that the age of slavery was still alive."

<TITLE>LLOYDS PULLS OUT OF EUROBOND/GILT MARKET MAKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyds Bank Plc said it is withdrawing
from market making in Eurobonds and U.K. Government bonds
(gilts).
    It said in a statement it will maintain an active presence
in short-term securities trading, swaps and other treasury
products, building on its strengths in traditional foreign
exchange and money markets.
    In the statement, Lloyds chief executive Brian Pitman said
"We have a relatively small position in these two overcrowded
markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to
opportunities which promise a better return on our
shareholders' investment."
    With this decision, Lloyds becomes the second major U.K.
Clearing bank to feel the effects of the deregulation of the
London Stock Exchange, or "Big Bang," last October. Earlier this
year, Midland Bank Plc pulled out of equity market making
because it did not believe the return justified the costs
involved in maintaining and developing a market share.
    Lloyds Treasurer Alan Moore subsequently told Reuters that
the decision was taken at a board meeting earlier today and had
been under discussion for some time.
    He said the move was not a reaction to any losses sustained
in the trading of Eurobonds or gilts but rather a result of a
"strategic review" of the future of Lloyds involvement in these
markets. In the end, Lloyds decided these markets did not
represent "an attractive return to our shareholders," he said.
    He noted that Lloyds had not expected its U.K. Government
bond operations would be profitable in the early stages,
although he declined to discuss the finances of the operation.
    "This is an overcrowed market," Moore said of the U.K.
Government bond market, which began Big Bang with 27 market
makers. Lloyds withdrawal now leaves the number at 26.
    Market participants noted that Lloyds was the only one of
the clearing banks which did not buy a jobber (middle man) or
broker before Big Bang.
    Under the old system, the gilt market operated under a
separate system which involved separate functions for jobbers
and brokers. Now these tasks have been taken up by market
makers acting as both.
    Moore said that one reason Lloyds decided to withdraw from
these markets was that they could no longer justify the
commitment of capital that was required to maintain these
operations.
    He said Lloyds would make every effort to redeploy
employees in these areas within the bank.

in five years, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> said.
    Philips is Europe's largest supplier of liquid crystal
displays (LCDs) currently used in lighter and more efficient
televisions and screens.
    Last year, the market was worth 683 mln dlrs. But Philips
sees a surge in demand with applications in monitors, test and
measuring equipment, cars and telecommunications equipment.
    Philips said the overall market value will have risen to
five billion dlrs by 1992.
    It has so far used LCDs only in industrial applications,
but said in a statement it was moving to get a big share of a
growing consumer products market.
    Pocket-sized LCDS are already produced and marketed by
Japanese manufacturers and sell at around 100 to 200 dlrs,
Philips spokesman Jack Reemers said.
    Philips hopes to launch its version later this year.

<TITLE>MINNESOTA MAY CONSIDER ANTI-TAKEOVER AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich is
considering calling a special legislative session to consider
amendments to the state's anti-takeover statute, according to
the governor's office.
    A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided
today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to
call a special session in the next few days.
   The governor's office said the possible action was triggered
by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp &lt;DH>, which has been the
subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said
the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to
make any takeover attempt in the state
more difficult.
       
    Dayton-Hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted
by next Friday, the spokesperson said.
    Press reports in Minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted
several legislators as saying they were inclined to support
legislation that would help Dayton-Hudson, according to a
governor's spokesperson.
   Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe was quoted as saying he
would be inclined to support any action that would help the
company, the spokesperson said.
   Robert Vanasek, the House speaker designate, was quoted in
the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as saying, "We are taking
their (Dayton-Hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going
to do what we can to help."

<DATELINE>    ST LOUIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>May Department Stores Co said it
expects record profits and sales in the fiscal 1988 and also
set a five-year 3.3 billion dlr capital expenditure plan.
    "Our sights are set on achieving our 13th consecutive year

    In the year ended January 31, 1987, the company earned 381

    Farrell also said he expects improved second-quarter

improvement over 1986," he said. In the quarter ended August
30, 1986, the company earned 45.6 mln dlrs or 52 cts on sales

stores and about 1,200 specialty stores.
    About two-thirds of the department stores will be opened by
Lord and Taylor, May Co, and J.W. Robinson's in California,
Hecht's in Washington, D.C., and G. Fox in Connecticut.
    The remainder of the 3.3 billion dlrs will be used for
store relocations, closings and remodelings, Farrell said.
    Sales per square foot rose eight pct in 1986 to 134 dlrs,
president Thomas Hays said, noting that the company seeks
annual increases of 10 pct.
    Also at the annual meeting, shareholders voted to approve
indemnification of the company's officers and directors.

<TITLE>COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RATZEBURG, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cold and wet weather in northern,
western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
fields.
    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
boosted sugar beet growth.
    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
development, Licht said.
    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
rated as slightly below normal.
    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
impossible.
    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
boosted beet development.
    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
beets are maturing very early this year.

<TITLE>UGANDA, MOZAMBIQUE WIN DEBT RESCHEDULING ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Paris Club of creditor nations agreed
to a major rescheduling of Uganda's and Mozambique's
government-to-government debts, the Club said in a statement.
    At meetings here this week, both countries were accorded
terms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club.
Uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-year
grace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionally
long 20-year period, with 10 years' grace.
    The Club said it approved of both countries' economic and
financial programs and would therefore make a contribution to
improve their external payments prospects.
    It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligations
and low per capita income, adding the solution of the
countries' debt problems would take a number of years.
    The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt service
capacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund in
the upper credit tranches "inappropriate."
    No details were available from the countries' embassies nor
from the Club on the amounts involved, but last week the
Ugandan Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said he was hoping
for a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs. Uganda's total foreign debt
is estimated at some 1.5 billion dlrs.
    A French Finance Ministry statement issued the same time as
the Paris Club statement, said France had formally agreed with
Gabon to reschedule bilateral unpaid debt amounting to about
440 mln francs.
    The bilateral agreement, covering payments due to have been
made by May 31 this year, follows the Paris Club's January
decision to grant Gabon an extended repayment period for its
government-to-government debt.
    The ministry said French aid to Gabon in 1987, within the
framework of the country's economic recovery program, amounts
to about 1.67 billion francs.

<DATELINE>    ADDIS ABABA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fifteen countries in Eastern and
Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by
10 pct every two years up to 1996.
    A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which
seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the
north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make
the first tariff cut next year.
    In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff
reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete
elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.
    The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros,
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda,
Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
    PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between
members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker
states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.
    The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely
traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the
organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.

<TITLE>FULL INTERSTATE BANKING GAINS IN ILLINOIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Illinois Governor James Thompson will
likely sign a bill setting December 1, 1990, as the trigger
date opening the state to wider interstate banking, a
gubernatorial spokesman said.
    The bill passed both chambers of the Illinois legislature
this week by wide margins.
    The bill provides that Illinois banks and bank holding
companies can be acquired by similar institutions from any
state with a reciprocal law. Current Illinois law limits
interstate banking to six Midwestern states.
    The governor had supported a July 1, 1988, date for full
interstate banking. Large banking firms, particularly Citicorp
&lt;CCI>, have lobbied for the earlier date.
    But legislation with the later date was approved in the
state's house and senate. The governor has the authority to use
an amendatory veto and pencil in an earlier trigger date.
    "I'm sure the bill will get his approval," the spokesman
said. "The only question is whether he will use his authority
to change the trigger date. He will hear from people who want
the different dates. I don't think he'll take action before
late summer."

<TITLE>U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By SUSAN SHERER, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. crude oil prices are at their
highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
policy changes from the session.
    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
Gulf.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
highest level since January 1986.
    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
agreement may only need a slight review.
    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
should begin easing.
    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
barrels in the fourth quarter.
    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
reduction in output.
    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman
Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,
analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
producers receive less money for their oil.
    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"
said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he
said.
    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securites.
    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.

<TITLE>FURTHER US DEFENSE WRITEOFFS LIKELY, ANALYSTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The tug-of-war over who pays to develop
new weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead
to more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.
    Singer Co &lt;SMF> and Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> recently announced
planned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major
defense programs under fixed-price government contracts.
    "It's a case of companies paying for things that in a
different environment the Defense Department would have paid
for," said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities
Corp.
    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increased
competitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked
contractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons
programs.
    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors
but have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,
analysts said.
    "It's a stricter environment," said Anthony Hatch of Argus
Research Corp. "Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and
more of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to
come."
    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, the
analysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,
high-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. Air
Force, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter
Experimental, LHX, under development for the Army.
    Other programs may also be affected, they said.
    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced
fighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,
analysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing for
a contract to develop a prototype ATF.
    Lockheed Corp &lt;LK>, General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD> and Boeing
Co &lt;BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp &lt;NOC>
and McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> on ATF.
    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are
Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc &lt;TXT>, coupled with
McDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX>
Sikorsky paired with Boeing.
    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnell
Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,
and a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be
made by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.
    Under the government's new procedures, contractors can
spend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  
typically recoup their investments during production.
    But now the government sometimes awards production to a
second contractor who did not develop the system. General
Electric Co &lt;GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine for
the Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of
F404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.
    Such tactics have increased competition but the government
now risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,
said Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.
    "Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worst
enemies. They were not cost efficient," LaTronica said. "Now
DOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other
way that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as
a national resource."
    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in
recent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products
than it imported, he noted.
    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in
government procurement may be coming.
    "I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,"
said John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.
    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe
the Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and
perhaps start paying more development money.
    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry
despite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,
said, "There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing
psychology of the last few years is starting to shift."
    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently
suggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get
sole production of the plane for a specified time.
    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,
Boeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to
develop the prototype.
    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is
that companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but
instead will wait for a second source production award.
    "But it may take a company going bust to really change
people's thinking," LaTronica said.

<TITLE>UNOCAL&lt;UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
guarantees, Unocal said.
    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

<TITLE>MERCK &lt;MRK>, SQUIBB &lt;SQB> BENEFIT FROM STUDY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Merck Co &lt;MRK> and Squibb Corp &lt;SQB>
will benefit from a study that shows lower levels of blood
cholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries,
lowering the risk of heart attacks, industry analysts said.
    Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body's
production of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 months
ahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year.
    "Certainly this study will create greater acceptance of
anti-cholesterol drugs," said Robert Uhl, a drug analyst at F.
Eberstadt Fleming.
    Although neither company's drug was used in the study,
which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University
of Southern California School of Medicine, both are leaders in
a new class of drugs that fight cholesterol.
    The study, reported in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, showed lower levels of cholesterol, achieved
through a combination of drugs and special diet, slowed and in
some cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in the
heart's arteries.
    Such build up leads to heart attacks, the leading cause of
death in the U.S.
    Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterol
could immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptoms
of coronary artery disease. The study advocated reduction of
cholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.
    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry
analysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug
therapy will gain wider acceptance.
    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein said "the culture can shift in terms of
drug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally
alter their diets".
    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600
mln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,
analysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs
annually in about next five years.
    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low
cholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and
colestipol, a drug Upjohn Co &lt;UPJ> has sold since 1977.
    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say
the new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. "Niacin leads to
tremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach
upset," Crossen said.
    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to
30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. "It isn't fun
to take," Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks
restricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under
10 mln dlrs a year.
    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have
little side effects because they target a key factor in the
body's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the
liver.
   
    "Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather
variable," said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice
president at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a
clear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.
    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a
tablet form swallowed once or twice a day.
    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an
advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this
year and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late
summer or fall.
    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for
regulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,
Sanders said.
    Warner Lambert Co &lt;WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co &lt;BMY> also
have cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,
but only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of
cholesterol inhibitors.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln
ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln
in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson
Matthey Plc said.
    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation
in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
single application for platinum.
    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
in London today.
    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
    He said South Africa was the most likely source of
additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
    The capital investment required to produce the additional
output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
Clark said.
    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
underpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.

200 mln dlrs of two-year senior extendable notes with a final
maturity of 1993 yielding 8.30 pct, said lead manager Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
    The notes have an 8-1/4 pct coupon and were priced at 99.90
to yield 85 basis points more than the when-issued two-year
Treasury note.
    After two years, holders can sell the notes back to
Manufacturers at par. In 1989 and every year until 1993, the
issuer will conduct an open reset on the yields of those notes
not sold back to it, Shearson said.
    Moody's Investors Service Inc rates the Manufacturers issue
A-3, compared to an A grade by Standard and Poor's Corp.
    The gross spread is 3.50 dlrs, the selling concession is
two dlrs and the reallowance is 1.25 dlrs. First Boston,
Prudential-Bache and Salomon Brothers co-managed the deal.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>European coffee roasters and traders
have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
coffee agreement, van Horick said.
    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
agreement, van Horick said.
    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
Brazil.
    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.
    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula
builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
everyone."
    Although full implications of the new formula have still to
be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
    Because the proposal provides that future quota
distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
new quota formula, " van Horick said.
    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
just get an agreement," van Horick added.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp will add to
its reserves against bad loans from less developed countries
when its board meets next week, E.F. Hutton analyst Fred Meinke
said.
    Meinke said a Continental executive told him Friday the
banking firm, parent of Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co of Chicago, will add to its reserves next week along
the lines of what other banks have been doing since Citicorp
&lt;CCI> initiated the provisioning last month.
    Continental Illinois has about 2.6 billion dlrs in loans to
Latin American countries.
    Meinke said he thinks Continental Illinois will add about
25 pct or more of its Latin American exposure to its loss
reserve, or about 650 mln dlrs or more.
    "They have a big reserve already. My guess this will be on
top of that," he said.

<TITLE>BROOKLYN UNION SAYS A RATE HIKE WOULD BE MODEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brooklyn Union Gas &lt;BU>, a New York gas
utility company, said it will try to limit any rate hikes to
customers by arranging alternative supplies to replace the spot
natural gas that Transco Energy Co &lt;E> no longer delivers, a
company official told Reuters.
    Edward Sondey, vice president of supply, said that under a
grandfather clause Brooklyn Union could request Transco to
transmit 165 mln cubic feet (mcf) a day of spot natural gas
after purchasing 250 mcf of contract gas from Transco.
    Brooklyn Union has been taking only 30 pct, or 75 mcf, of
the contract gas from Transco, and acquiring about 120 mcf on
the spot, or non-contract, market, he said.
    Lacking access to spot gas through Transco would not cost
Brooklyn Union more than 50 cts per mln btu for now,
Sondey said, as Transco contract gas costs 2.55 dlrs per mln
compared to about two dlrs for spot gas.
    "The rate increase will not be serious," Sondey said.
    The contract price at 2.55 dlrs per mln BTU has been
effective since May 1 after Transco lowered its commodity rate
to reflect seasonal weakness, making it the lowest in the 12
months ended May 31, according to report submitted by Brooklyn
Union to New York Public Utility Commission.
    In peak demand season, Transco's contract gas reached as
high as 4.30 to 4.40 dlrs per mln btu, a commission official
said.
    Industry analysts expected little adverse effect from
interrupted spot supplies on Brooklyn Union's earnings for its
current fiscal year ending September 30.
    But if the open access problem to Transco is not resolved
this winter, high cost of contract gas could cut into the
company's profit, they said.

deficit 119.02 billion dlrs compared with a deficit of 165.81
billion dlrs in the previous fiscal year.
    Outlays last month were 83.44 billion dlrs, down from 85.64
billion dlrs in May a year ago and 84.24 billion dlrs in April,
the department said.

    The bulge in receipts in April which resulted in the

investors Natalie and Paul Koether told the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has acquired 299,523 shares of American
Physicians Service Group Inc, or 5.1 pct of the total.
    The Koether group said it bought the stock for 1.0 mln dlrs
for "capital appreciation" and may buy more.
    The group also said Paul Koether met on June 8 with
management representatives for talks that included the
company's business, potential acquisitions for the company,
possible opportunities to expand the company and the
possibility of Koether being named to its board.
    The group did not say whether the talks resulted in any
agreements.
    As they have done in several SEC filings concerning other
companies in which they have had a stake, the Koethers said
they reserve the right "to take any actions which they deem
appropriate to maximize the value of the shares," but said they
have no current plans about taking any action.
    While they may buy more American Physicians shares, the
Koethers also said they may decide to sell some or all of the
their stake in the company.

<TITLE>LLOYDS BANK BOND MARKET WITHDRAWAL CALLED PRUDENT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyds Bank Plc's &lt;LLOY.L> decision to
withdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and U.K. Government
bonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other market
participants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts.
    "It (the move) really isn't a surprise. They lost a lot of
money in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want
to cut their losses while they can," said Keith Brown, banking
analyst at Greenwell Montagu.
    "The question now is how many other gilt market makers will
face a similar fate," one senior gilt market maker said.
    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. "They are
the first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out
of eurobond market making altogether," said a member of the
Association of International Bond Dealers London staff.
    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds
had frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond
operations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.
    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearing
bank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from the
gilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London
Stock Exchange in October.
    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L>, the fourth
largest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equities
on the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. It
continues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a prepared
statement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the
bank had a "relatively small position in these two overcrowded
markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to
opportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders
investment."
    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term
securities trading, swaps and other treasury products.
    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the
decision was forward looking and followed a "strategic review" of
the prospects for Lloyds in these markets. "We decided the
return just was not attractive," he said.
    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board
this morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration
for some time.
    He denied that the move was a "reaction to events in the
trading room" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt
operations were not profitable in the early stages of the new
market.
    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds
Merchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he
said were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.
For all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln
stg. "Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses," Brown
said, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the
bank's exposure to Latin America.
    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase
their provisions against bad loans to third world countries
since Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its
provisions in mid-May.
    National Westminster Bank Plc &lt;NWBL.L>, the largest of the
clearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow
Citicorp's &lt;CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was
adding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.
    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America
after Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.
    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore
denied that today's action had any connection. "It is totally
unrelated," he said.
    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the
announcement was made. But market participants were
dumbfounded.
    "We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the
announcement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I
still have job," said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be
identified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it
could to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other
parts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these
markets was relatively small, other market participants,
particularly in gilts, were unnerved.
    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes
during a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have
been battered by the lack of investor participation, following
the June 11 U.K. general election.
    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a
return of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy
demand. These expectations have failed to be met and both
markets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.
    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was
experiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials
have never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.
    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems
facing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its
own team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a
broker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.
    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted
separately but now market makers perform both tasks.
    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed
doubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27
market makers, even if turnover increased substantially.
    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that
some of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.

<TITLE>SEC SUPPORTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission said it supported legislation to define insider
trading and would recommend language for such a definition
within six weeks.
    Acting SEC chairman Charles Cox told the Senate Banking
Committee a bill proposed this week to define insider trading
as the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was good
but contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce the
Commission's flexibility in prosecuting cases.
    "The Commission believes a definition of insider trading is
desirable," Cox said.
   
    He promised to provide the SEC's recommended definition to
the committee by August 3.
    The bill proposed by Sens. Donald Riegle, a Michigan
Democrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, would
make it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on inside
information even if the person providing the information did
not use it to make a securities transaction.
    Federal law enforcement officials have said a definition of
insider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crime
to prove.
   
    Cox said the SEC was having success in its insider trading
cases despite the lack of a clear definition.
    He became acting chairman of the agency when chairman John
Shad left to become U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.
    President Reagan nominated Northwestern University law
professor David Ruder as SEC chairman on Wednesday, but he may
not be confirmed by the Senate for several weeks.
   
    Riegle, the chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee,
said he wanted to act on the legislation this year, but Thomas
Moore, a member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisors, said action should be delayed until the Supreme Court
ruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by former
Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.
    Winans was convicted for telling a friend in advance what
stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks
usually went up or down in price depending on Winans'
recommendation.
   
    "We believe it would be better to wait until the Supreme
Court has reviewed the Winans case before any leigilation is
considered. After the court decides this case we can better
consider how the law might be changed. Until that time,
legislation is premature," Moore said in his testimony.

annual meeting that the company and its principal shareholders
will repurchase about 130,000 shares of its common stock.
    The company's portion of the repurchase obligation equals
about 800,000 dlrs, which the company said it plans to record
as a capital transaction in 1987.
    Originally, Gemcraft said it estimated that it could be
required to buy as many as 300,000 shares for about 3.0 mln
dlrs.
    Gemcraft originally estimated its portion of trading losses
could total as much as 600,000 dlrs and recorded a charge to
earnings in that amount in the 1986 fourth quarter.
    The company said it plans to provide an after-tax credit to
income of about 200,000 dlrs in the second quarter of 1987 to
reflect this difference.
    Gemcraft also told shareholders it sees a profitable 1987
second quarter. In the year-ago period, it reported earnings of
908,000 dlrs, or 6 cts a share on sales of 88.8 mln.

the consumer products company's stock.
    Jacobs, who made his comment in response to an enquiry, did
not comment further.
    Yesterday, Gillette rebuffed a takeover proposal from
Revlon Inc. Under an agreement between the two companies,
Revlon must have the permission of Gillette's board before
making an offer to shareholders. The board declined to grant
that permission.
   
    Gillette has been the topic of takeover speculation for
several weeks. Its stock has traded heavily, and arbitragers
said they believe Jacobs may not be the only investor who has a
sizeable position in the company.

<TITLE>RAPITECH &lt;RPSY.O> IN HEWLETT PACKARD &lt;HWP> DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SUFFERN, N.Y., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rapitech Systems Inc said it has
entered into an agreement under which its FORTRIX-C software is
available to Hewlett-Packard Co's salesforce for assisting
customers the migration of applications software from one
operating environment to another.
    The company also said FORTRIX-C has been selected by
American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> for use in its Vendor
Involvement Program.  It said it cannot forecast the impact on
its profits because neither agreement contains purchase
requirements.
    It said it expects continued losses through the rest of
fiscal 1987 ending July 31.
    The company lost 548,000 dlrs last year. Today it reported
a nine month loss of 810,000 dlrs compared with a 394,000 dlr
loss a year earlier and attributed the poorer performance to
substantially increased marketing, sales and research
expenditures partly resulting from the hiring of additional
staff.
    Rapitech further said it has signed agreements for Computer
Systems and Consultants BV of the Netherlands and Sages Group
of France to represent the Rapitech Conversionware product line
in the Benelux countries, in France and in French-speaking
cantons of Switzerland.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia is to urge fellow tin
producing countries to contribute more money towards research
into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries
minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.
    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he
had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive
committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,
to draw up a paper on the matter.
    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.
    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals
for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be
defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.
    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was
adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,
they would be compensated through access to the EC for
alternative exports.
    "Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot
see how this would work out in our case," Lim said.
    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250
mln dlrs a year.
    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC
meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.
    "Not enough research and development effort has been put in
by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes
such as aluminium, paper and plastics," Lim said.
    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an
exciting possible new application.
    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money
which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the
new paper was produced.
    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental
barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International
Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord
into some EC languages are still being awaited.
    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's
behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it
was important there should not be a long "interregnum" between
the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming
into force.
    He described the present accord as a model for commodity
agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and
consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and
control over buffer stock management.

<TITLE>LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills."
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation."
    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress."
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."

<TITLE>REED INTL DENIES BID APPROACH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L> denied
rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a
takeover bid and said it had received no approach.
    "In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to
make clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed's
chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.
    Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc
&lt;HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed
Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased
back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread
decline in U.K. Equity prices.
    Share market analysts said speculators were buying the
stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort
to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L>.
    Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to
take it over, analysts added.
    They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's
bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention
to Reed.

year, are part of a cost reduction and plant consolidation
program.
    The company said plants to closed are the Trans-Aid factory

England and the Sunrise Medical GmbH distribution facility in
Bischofsheim, West Germany.
    The Turbotville and Dunstable operations will be folded

<TITLE>COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. government trade official
responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"
Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
discussions with Colombian officials.
    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.
    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
European coffee roasters and traders.
    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
coffee market are used to set export limits.

    It said Diamond should benefit from production efficiency,
quality control and plant closings. But due to the company's
major role in selling to the distilled spirits industry, one of
the smaller markets for glass containers, its margins and asset
returns may not materially improve, Moody's said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL'S MOTOR INDUSTRY SUFFERS MAJOR SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's crisis-ridden motor industry
-- which is dominated by the subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F>, Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI>, General Motor Corp &lt;GM> and Ford
Co &lt;F> -- has not made a single domestic sale for the last four
days, and several assembly lines will stop shortly, industry
spokesmen said.
    The motor manufacturers have been feeling the pinch for
months, with demand slumping as the country heads into
recession.
    But the industry hit a fresh problem when dealers decided
on Tuesday to stop buying any cars or trucks to protest high
government taxes on vehicles. The dealers' decision was sparked
by a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by the
government to cover industry's rising costs.
    Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association of
Autmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt their
livelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because they
cost too much.
    "It is a question of our survival. The price of cars in
Brazil has reached an insupportable level," he said. A GM Opala
Diplomata, he said, costs 30,000 dlrs in Brazil, while an
equivalent car in the United States would cost about 10,000
dlrs.
    The National Association of Automotive Vehicle
Manufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues for
another week, consequences will be serious.
    Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told Reuters, "The
consequences will first of all be collective holidays then
lay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation."
    A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about half
of its 21,000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13.
    Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2,000 workers a
month's holiday, from July 6, halting production for the
domestic market.
    Carvalho said the industry was working at 3,500 vehicles a
day, below its 1986 average of 4,700 and capacity of 5,100.
    During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze, feverish
demand far outstripped supply. The industry says it could have
sold many more cars than it produced, but was constrained by a
lack of parts.
    Today the picture is completely different after months of
raging inflation and demand has all but disappeared.
    Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct to
the cost of the vehicle. He described the taxes as "the highest
in the universe and the galaxy."
    Domestic car sales during the first five months of this
year slipped to their lowest level for a decade, 241,632 units
compared with 382,182 units during the same period last year.
    On the bright side, exports are booming -- sales abroad in
May totalled 242 mln dlrs, a record figure.
    The motor industry is critical of the government of
President Jose Sarney, which has gained a reputation as an
indifferent manager of the economy.
    Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitely
investments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year.
    Wolfgang Sauer, president of Volkswagen do Brasil, said the
government had created a crisis of confidence.
    Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150,000 people.

<TITLE>U.S. BROADENS NATIONAL BANK CAPITAL FORBEARANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
Robert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan giving
temporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra time
to come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements.
    The policy, which originally was intended to give well run
banks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuild
depleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to all
national banks, Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar.
A text of his remarks was made public today.
    The comptroller's office will extend the application
deadline for the plan to Dec. 31, 1989 from Dec. 31, 1987.
    It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks to
boost their capital levels to the required minimum level.
    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that a
bank have capital of at least four pct to participate in the
capital forbearance plan.
    "In theory, a bank could be allowed to continue to operate
with nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild its
capital base," Clarke said, though he added that a bank in that
situation would have a have "a virtually ironclad plan for a
prompt restoration of capital" to be accepted.
    The critical linkage to forbearance is that the
fundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank can
survive: in short, capable management and financial prospects,"
Clarke said.
    He said the program will continue to be closed to insolvent
banks.

affirmed the debt ratings of Chrysler Corp and Chrysler
Financial Corp following the automaker's agreement to acquire
Electrospace Systems Inc for 367 mln dlrs.
    It said the acquisition could easily be funded from
existing cash balances, still leaving Chrysler with an adequate
level of precautionary cash.
    At March 31 Chrysler had 2.9 billion dlrs of cash and
marketable securities, up from 2.7 billion dlrs at year-end
1986, S and P noted.
    Standard and Poor's affirmed the BBB senior debt of
Chrysler and Chrysler Financial. Also affirmed were the finance
arm's BBB-minus subordinated debt and A-2 commercial paper.
    Electrospace makes communications and electronic systems
for aerospace applications. Because of the company's relatively
small size, the acquisition should have little effect on
Chrysler's balance sheet, S and P said.

the advent of OPEC's mid-year meeting, traders and industry

    "If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production," a
traders said, "LPG supplies will be up without corresponding
rise in demand."
    Petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in

    An industry meeting in Dublin this week also drew many

    Algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the
U.S. Gulf, keeping Mediterranean prices steady, traders said.
    In the Mideast Gulf, propane appeared easing slightly,
after a major U.S. oil company bought propane on formula which
netted back about 123 dlrs, cif Mideast Gulf, which was two
dlrs below Saudi Arabia's government selling price (gsp),
industry sources said.
    Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs
and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said.

<TITLE>U.S. BUDGET DUE FOR APPROVAL, TRUCE POSSIBLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19, - </DATELINE><BODY>After battling President Reagan all
year, Congress is about to pass a trillion dollar 1988 budget
that sets the stage for even fiercer fighting over its tax and
defence policies.
    But when the dust settles, congressional budget analysts
say, Reagan and the Democratic opposition may finally sit down
at a "budget summit" to call a truce and work out a deal over
implementing the budget he opposes.
    "I think he essentially will (negotiate)," said a prominent
House leader who did not want to be identified. "The ball is in
his court ... We've done everything we could to make a summit."
The Democrat budget plan calls for $19 billion in new taxes
next year, $64 billion over three years, and is set to be
passed by the Democratic-led Congress next week. It would cut
next year's deficit by about $37 billion to $134 billion.
    On Tuesday last week, Reagan said he would consider talks,
except on defence or taxes, but three days later argued that
Congress would first have to bend even further.

<TITLE>KISSINGER FORESEES ROUGH TIME FOR U.S. ECONOMY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said the U.S. Government is disregarding the
future of its economy and could within three to five years "find
itself on a situation similar to those of indebted Latin
American countries."
    "The United States will not be able to service its debt
without austerity," he told a news conference.
    The former secretary also criticised his country's foreign
policy.
    "We have so many problems of our own at home that we should
not be sending people like me and many others around the world
to tell other countries how to handle their problems."
    Kissinger came to Brazil on a private visit to make the
opening speech at the Sixth World Congress of the International
Federation of Purchasing and Materials Management, to be held
here June 24 through 26.
    During his visit he is to call on President Jose Sarney,
Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu Sodre, Finance Minister Luiz
Carlos Bresser Pereira and Chamber of Deputies chairman Ulysses
Guimaraes, Monday in Brasilia.
    Asked to comment on the economic measures imposed by the
Brazilian government last week, which included a new price
freeze up to 90 days, Kissinger said: "I have only read a
summary of the plan. In principle, it seems like a reasonable
plan which could succeed and lead to an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund."

<TITLE>KUWAIT SEEN WANTING TO LEASE SOME U.S. TANKERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States said Kuwait was
discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to
transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of
its own vessels under American flags.
    State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
    "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakley
said. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangement
could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."
    In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy
escort in the Gulf, she said.

   The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator
of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached
an American shipping company about the possibility of a
charter.
    Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
vessels flying the U.S. flag "would be protected," the newspaper
reported.
    Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said "we are moving forward
in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations."

<TITLE>MEXICO REJECTS CALLS TO REPRIVATISE BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEXICO CITY, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior officials from government and
the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) rejected
business sector calls this week to reprivatise the 26 Mexican
banks, nationalised five years ago.
    PRI president Jorge de la Vega, speaking in Saltillo,
Coahuila state, said the party would never permit
reprivatisation "because the banks belong to all Mexicans."
    Speaking in Hermosillo, Sonora State, Deputy Finance
Minister Francisco Suarez Davila said the nationalised banks
have proved a positive instrument through which the government
has been able to promote economic development.
    Suarez davila said that in the hands of the state, banks
have performed well and that the government will adopt whatever
reorganization is needed to improve efficiency.
    Earlier this week, the newly elected head of the powerful
business coordinating council, agustin legorreta, called for
the banks to be reprivatized, charging that competition and
efficiency had been eroded.
    Then president jose lopez portillo nationalised the banks
in 1982, accusing them of aiding capital flight. Later that
year, miguel de la madrid took office and announced a scheme to
offer 34 pct of the banks' shares to the public.

<TITLE>DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH> NOT INTERESTED IN ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dayton Hudson Corp, in a
letter to employees, said it told an "aggressive buyer" of the
company's stock that it does not want to be acquired.
    A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> was the
company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.
    The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected
soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.
    According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson
management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to
the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
independent.
    Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.
    A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor
is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's
anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend
itself.
    Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators
would probably look at language similar to that contained in
Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would
probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a
company for its own profit.
   "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we
have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C> MOVE CONTINUES TREND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp is taking a small step
away from automobiles and towards military contracting with the
purchase of Electrospace Systems Inc &lt;ELE>, analysts said.
    "A chief goal of Chrysler is to gain military business for
their Gulfstream planes and this should help that cause
dramatically," said analyst Gary Glaser at First Boston Corp.
    Chrysler, which bought Gulfstream Aerospace Corp in 1985,
earlier said Electrospace agreed to be acquired in a friendly
merger for about 367 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said the merger continues a trend in the
automobile industry of diversification away from carmaking.
    General Motors Corp &lt;GM> paid about five billion dlrs for
Hughes Aircraft, an aerospace company, in 1985. A year earlier
it bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, for
about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> has added First Nationwide
Savings as part of a move into financial services.
    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated its
interest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp &lt;LK> once rumored as a
possible target.
    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according to
analysts. Ford has about 9.5 billion dlrs of cash and
securities on hand, one analyst said.
    "The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry)
is to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of the
automobile sales cycle," said analyst Jack Kirnan at Kidder
Peabody and Co. "One way companies feel they can do it,
particularly GM and Chrysler, is by diversifying into
aerospace," Kirnan said. Ford has been "a little bit of a
laggard" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to
some investors.
    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,
when it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.
    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for
Electrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay
for the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of
191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.
    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the
Richardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying
American Motors Corp &lt;AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal
set to close later this year.
    "Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a
year or more and will absorb a lot of debt," Kirnan said,
making them the most heavily leveraged auto company.
    But other analysts said the relative small size of
Electrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.
    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed
significantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln
dlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.
    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's
sales were to the military.
    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,
Chrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the
automobile business.
    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that
Gulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,
composites and aerodynamic design. "Those will all be important
technologies for winning in the automobile business in the
1990s," Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should add
significantly to the electronics area, he said.
    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by
one-time items and but should recover this year.
    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for
Electrospace.
    "They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or
more professional people. They also have accounting systems in
Texas to manage their business with the Defense Department," he
said.
    Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into the
military market. "Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed more
at the commercial market, which is a different kettle of fish,"
Miller said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PENTAGON STOPS NEW BUSINESS WITH TOSHIBA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Pentagon has stopped approving
any new military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>
over a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to
the Soviet Union, a senior defense official said.
    "We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba)
pending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter," Deputy
Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told Reuters,
confirming published reports on the matter.
    The temporary ban, which Bryen said has been in effect
unofficially since April, could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns
of dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon, including a
pending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers.
    Bryen said the U.S. military services have not signed any
contracts with Toshiba since April, when publicity arose over
subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of
milling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers.
    The Japanese government has been investigating the case and
it was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large
milling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early 
1984.
    But Bryen told Reuters in an interview that the Pentagon
has now been informed by Japanese police that at least four
more smaller machines capable of making such precision
propellers were also sold to the Kremlin, apparently in 1984.
    "There may be even more beyond that. I don't know yet," Bryen
said.
    Toshiba is known to be seeking a U.S. Air Force contract
for 90,000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs. The Air
Force has called for new bids on that contract, partly because
of the Toshiba investigation, Pentagon officials said.
    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the
computer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding
because of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by
U.S. import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics.
    Two days ago, three U.S. senators said they wanted a
temporary ban on all U.S. imports of Toshiba Corp products,
including television sets and videotape recorders.
    Senators Jake Garn of Utah, Richard Shelby of Alabama and
John Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to
a major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer.
    The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology
transfer, and Pentagon officials have told Reuters that some of
the state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on
Soviet attack submarines.
    The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba
Machine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one
year.
    The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was
involved in the original technology transfer, providing vital
computer software to be used with the Japanese milling
equipment.
    But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen
said that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more
recent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment.

<TITLE>GROUP CUTS ZONDERVAN&lt;ZOND.O> STAKE TO 3.8 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of several investor groups
formerly associated with London investor Christopher Moran in
his unsuccessful bid to take over Zondervan Corp last year,
said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, led by investors Lawrence Altschul and James
Apostolakis, said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,
or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.
    The group, which earlier this month said in an SEC filing
it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, said
it sold 89,000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.
    The group had joined with the Moran group, which last year
assembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during its
unsuccessful takeover try.
    Last month, the Moran group broke up and splintered into
various factions. Moran himself withdrew from the takeover
effort and last reported his personal stake at 4.8 pct.
    A group led by Miwok Capital Corp, a California broker with
a 10.6 pct stake, and another one led by Minneapolis
stockbroker Jeffrey Wendel with 2.6 pct, have both made recent
SEC filings saying they are seeking agreements with other
parties who may want to seek control of the company.

<TITLE>NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan's nominee as top
policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.
    The agency requires public companies and investment
vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
condition any time they issue new securities.
    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
become the nation's 35th president.
    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Administration asked Congress to
replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
should pay about the same rates of duties.
    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to
deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
differing systems which they now face."
    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
January 1988.

<TITLE>ITALY DEFICIT NOT DUE TO LIBERALIZATION-MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario
Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
securities.
    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
securities purchases.
   "The deficit can be better attributed to premature and
delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinelli
said in a statement.
    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
it had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."
    "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
borders," said the newspaper.
    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to
say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase
deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA'S ALFONSIN MEETS IMF CHIEF CAMDESSUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine President Raul Alfonsin
met for more than an hour with International Monetary Fund
Managing Director Michel Camdessus, and Argentine economy
minister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussed
Argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package.
    Sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95
billion dlr loan, which forms the core of the package, has been
subscribed.
    Citibank, the chairman of Argentina's bank advisory
committee, said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91
pct.
    The IMF has said that a "critical mass" of bank commitments
is needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlr
standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina.
    Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass,
Sourrouille said, "That has not been defined but anywhere over
90 pct we are doing fine."
    Although most of the money has been subscribed, officials
noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold
93 pct of its debt. They are worried that it might take a long
time to persuade the other banks to join the deal.
    Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus, who had not
met before, mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic
situation. Alfonsin, who is beginning a four-day private visit
to the U.S., was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World
Affairs Council, a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing
public awareness of international affairs.
    In his speech, Alfonsin said economic integration is the
only way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.
    "This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious
challenge facing Latin America this century, perhaps the most
audacious of our history," he said.

<TITLE>TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, FERC.
    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
transport its own gas to customers.
    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC
guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
gas it has bought but could not sell.
    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps
FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
before all transitional problems are solved."
    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure
under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure
for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from
Louisiana and Texas up to New England.
    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional
issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by
FERC in the near future.
    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the
industry's continued ability to provide its customers with
reliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co
president R.C. Thomas.

<DATELINE>    Caracas, june 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela may turn to the international
monetary fund for credits as part of the country's overall
effort to reestablish financial flows from abroad, finance
minister manuel azpurua said today.
    "this is no secret. It's just one of the steps the executive
has begun taking to reestablish financial flows to the country,"
azpurua told reporters at the finance ministry.
    He did not specify what types of loans venezuela would seek
from the fund or the amounts involved.
    A technical team from the imf is currently in caracas
gathering data for its annual report on the venezuelan economy,
the finance minstry said. Members of the mission met today with
officials from the ministry's public finance department.
    Venezuela is one of the few latin american debtors which
has not drawn standby or extended fund facilty loans from the
imf since the region's financial crisis began in 1982.
    The country has an imf quota of 1.371 mln sdr's (1.75
billion dollars), according to the fund's 1986 report.

<TITLE>U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Barry, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The economy faces lackluster growth
and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "
Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
told Reuters.
    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
personal income and consumption, he says.
    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"
Gramley said.
    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
and said the recovery was showing anemia.
    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace
of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
accommodative.
    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
to the risk of a recession.
    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
inventory overhang still exists.
    He says the boost in production came from smaller
industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
recession," Mauro said.
    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
trade deficit will continue to improve.
    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.
    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
inflation.
    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he
would like the Fed to tighten credit.
    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
a prominent international banker.
    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
the mark will continue for years because the United States is
the world's largest debtor nation.
    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.
"It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.

<TITLE>CONDOM RECALLS RISE DUE TO FDA TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Food and Drug Administration said
stepped up testing of condoms by the agency has led to a three
recalls by U.S. manufacturers and the detention of foreign-made
condoms at U.S. borders.
    The FDA said industry standards require that roughly no
more than four out of 1,000 condoms leak. Condoms are tested by
pouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage.
    The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls, N.J., has
voluntarily recalled one lot of Sheik Fetherlite condoms, which
was distributed to 22 accounts through the United States.
   
    The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of the
condoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time of
the recall and are being recovered.
    National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood, Ill, voluntarily
recalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condoms
which were distributed to a wholesaler in California and two
retailers in Indiana and Michigan, the FDA said.
    The FDA said National estimates that none of the suspect
lot remains on the market. The FDA also said National recalled
two more lots of condoms following additional FDA tests.
    The FDA also said Circle Rubber Corp of Newark, N.J., is
voluntarily recalling Saxon and L'appel condoms after being
informed of FDA test results. The FDA said the condoms were
distributed in North Carolina and Illinois.
    The FDA urged condom makers on April 7 to inform consumers
about how condoms should be used to increase protection against
sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Since April, the
FDA said it had detained 15 shipments of condoms made by firms
in Korea and four shipments of condoms from Malaysia.

    He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln

    He said the average limit of errors for the official crop
harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first

    He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the
Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the
guarantee minimum price.

<TITLE>UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The six basis point rise of the past
month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
dollar holds firm.
    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
points over the last month, largely over indications that
inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief
financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities, said.
    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
longer term.
    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
1.5 pct, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than
expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such
a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"
Kahan said.
    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic
weakness down the road, he said.
    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
analysts said.
    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May
18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
in mid-June, Duggan said.
    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
above the 93 level.
    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
Brian Singer said.
    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
of the dollar," Kahan said.
    Additional influences next week will be possible
developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not
be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.
    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
psychology.

<TITLE>CANADA POST SEEKS MEDIATOR, VIOLENCE ON PICKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada Post asked the federal government
to appoint a mediator to help end an increasingly violent
series of strikes by the country's letter carriers.
    The government is expected to respond quickly to the
request that was made after the union formally rejected the
corporation's latest offer to settle the four-day-old dispute.
    The state-run postal service also said it would halt the
use of replacement workers that the union has blamed for the
trouble on the picket line.
    "We have become increasingly concerned that the safety of
our employees, both striking employees and replacement workers,
is at risk," Canada Post negotiator Harold Dunstan told
reporters at a downtown Ottawa hotel.
    Robert McGarry, president of the 20,000 member Letter
Carriers Union, told reporters he and other union leaders would
consider suspending the walkouts for a week while the mediator
is involved.
    In a bid to step up pressure on management, letter carriers
walked out in Toronto today where some 50 pct of the country's
mail is sorted.
    Workers also set up picket lines in other populous cities
in southern Ontario, but went back to work in most other
centers across Canada.
    There have been several arrests, property damage, and
sometimes violent clashes between strikers and replacement
workers whom the corporation hired to try and keep the mail
moving.
    The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), which
represents postal employees who are not letter carriers and
which is not on strike, said one of its workers was stabbed and
is now in the hospital after a scuffle broke out with a
replacement worker in Toronto early today.
    Police, however, said they had no report of a stabbing.
    CUPW President Jean-Claude Parrot called for the
resignation of Andre Harvie, minister responsible for Canada
Post, for condoning the use of the so-called strikebreakers.
    "The federal government has (the) blood of workers on its
hands in this postal strike," Parrot told reporters at the
union's Ottawa headquarters.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JUDGE HEARS APPEALS AGAINST MANVILLE &lt;QMAN> PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A federal judge heard arguments that
Manville Corp's chapter 11 reorganization plan, which was
confirmed in December, should be thrown out.
    During a four-and-a-half hour hearing, U.S. District Judge
Whitman Knapp heard arguments in five different appeals.
Whitman took the issues under advisement and will rule at a
later date.
    Key challenges were made by a group of Manville
shareholders, who claim they were not adequately represented
during the bankruptcy proceedings and that a 2.5 billion dlr
fund to pay victims of asbestos is overfunded.
   
    Another challenge came from a group of asbestos victims who
claimed the trust fund was underfunded.
    Today, Manville lawyers said there have been about 54,000
claims filed by those injured by asbestos.
    The reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund, with
initial funding of 125 mln dlrs, to pay for property damage
claims. Additional funds will be available if needed. Manville
said there are currently 9,500 property damage claims filed.
    Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and its
reorganization plan was approved by all parties except the
common stockholders.
   
    The stockholders objected to the proposal because it would
greatly dilute the value of their holdings. The plan would have
the effect of converting every eight shares of common stock
into just one share.
    Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for
further delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. Herbert
Edelman, one of Manville's lawyers, pointed out that many
thousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments
and that many victims had already died.
    He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found
Manville to be insolvent.
    "They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that
nebulous value that may be down the road," Edelman said.
    Common shareholders claim they were not adequately
represented because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland
refused requests to divide the equity holders committee into
two separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders and
the other preferred stock shareholders.
    During confirmation hearings of the plan, the equity
committee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing,
saying he could not represent both groups.
    The equity holders committee was then abolished.
   
    An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the
company's stock was present at the confirmation hearings.
However, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or
cross examine witnesses.
    During today's hearing Paul Gonson, a Washington lawyer
representing the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Judge
Knapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders
did not have adequate representation.
    Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the
New York law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner and Hellman. "They
have one of the best law firms in town," Knapp said.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, June 28 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banking authorities and police are
investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading
house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market, Finance
Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters.
    The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial
Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said
on Friday night.
    Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his
brother Luigi Muggia, have left Venezuela.
    Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the "parallel market" in
which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves.
    The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the
licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel
market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the
value of the U.S. Dollar here.
    Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock
Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house,
said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la
Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total
amount of almost one mln dlrs.
    The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in
Venezuela for more than 20 years.

<TITLE>TOKYO STOCKS OUTLOOK UNCERTAIN DUE TO YEN, OPEC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Kynge, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for Tokyo stocks are mixed this
week with investors trying to figure out the future of the
yen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's
latest accord on crude output and pricing, brokers said.
    They said the market should extend the dull trend it has
been in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record
close at 25,929.42 on June 17.
    It ended at 24,902.72 on Saturday and fell further this
morning to close at 24,707.68 in an uncertain reaction to the
weaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord.
    Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper,
less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second
sections, which were generally showing more resilience. The
second section index, in contrast to the first, closed at a
record 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17
of 2,401.71.
    "Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic
economy are a good bet," said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd. He said his observation was based on figures showing that
business activity in Japan is booming.
    The government said on Friday that department store and
supermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,
while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in
the same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expected
more such figures, but said many stocks linked to domestic
demand remain overpriced.
    "They are hard to find, but companies with an attractive
niche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currency
movements, are the best bet," said a broker at a foreign
securities house who declined to be identified.
    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic
consumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer price
index rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive
month on month increase.
    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,
which erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising
prices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.
    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut
in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now
died, discouraging investors, brokers said.
    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer
a downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.
    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may
also firm, brokers said. "I have never been able to justify this
because it should mean that the cost of importing rises," said a
broker at Yamaichi Securities Co. "It just always happens."
    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally
if the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue
chip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making
them look less attractive, brokers said.
    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the
market index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp
down rising capital outflows into dollar investments from
Japan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.
    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the
balance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower
dollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand
for American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers
said.
    "If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a
few exporters," said one foreign broker.

<TITLE>BFG PROFIT DIPS IN FIRST FOUR MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG's
&lt;BKFG.F> (BfG) partial operating profits in the first four
months of this year were lower than in the same period in 1986,
management board chairman Thomas Wegscheider said.
    But the balance sheet total at the end of May was four pct
higher than one year earlier as savings continued to flow into
the bank, he told the annual press conference.
    BfG parent bank partial operating profits halved to 166 mln
marks in 1986 from 311 mln in 1985, with the balance sheet
falling to 48.80 billion marks from 49.02 billion.
    Wegscheider declined to give a forecast for the full year,
and noted that the first four months of this year were not
comparable with the 1986 period as first quarter 1986 had been
extremely successful for the bank.
    The general banking environment this year was not easy,
with the interest margin under pressure, securities business
suffering from markedly lower bourse turnover than last year
and sluggish credit demand, he said.
    "As far as the specific BfG environment is concerned, we
note a clear atmospheric improvement, which however is being
reflected in the figures only slowly," he added.
    Wegscheider said the bank was recovering from speculation
about its ownership, which had unnerved many customers last
year, and from the financial crisis involving the Neue Heimat
housing group linked to BfG's former trade union owners.
    Insurer Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>,
AMB, acquired 50 pct plus one share of BfG late last year.
    Wegscheider said that earnings from trading on the bank's
own account in 1986 had been a little higher than partial
operating profits, but had performed better in the first half.
    Following the AMB acquisition, BfG sold its 25.01 pct stake
in &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, its 74.9
pct in &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>.
    These sales produced extraordinary earnings of 700 mln
marks, with parent bank earnings from profit transfer
agreements rising to 494.18 mln marks in 1986 from 54.24 mln in
1985, and other earnings including writing bank risk provisions
rising to 317.95 mln marks from 65.67 mln.
    Wegscheider said most of the extraordinary earnings went
into risk provisions.
    Total risk provisions, undetailed, were more than twice as
high as in 1985, Wegscheider said. Published group risk
provisions rose to 865.9 mln marks from 366.7 mln. But the
share of credits to problem countries covered by risk
provisions was still below 50 pct at BfG, he said.
    The BSV Bank stake sale was one of the main factors behind
a 3.8 billion mark drop in the group balance sheet in 1986.
    Wegscheider said the re-organization of BfG, planned before
the AMB acquisition and involving a decentralization, would
occupy much of BfG's energies this year. BfG and AMB were also
looking at ways of cooperating in sales of services.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREAN RULING PARTY ANNOUNCES REFORM PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's ruling party announced a
reform package which includes a recommendation for direct
presidential elections.
    There was no immediate reaction from President Chun Doo
Hwan but Democratic Justice Party (DJP) chairman Roh Tae-woo,
who unveiled the reforms, vowed to resign if they were
rejected.
    Roh, whose confirmation as government candidate to succeed
Chun sparked weeks of massive demonstrations around the
country, said he would withdraw his candidacy and quit his DJP
post if Chun failed to accept the package.
    "I have reached the conclusion that I cannot but choose the
direct presidential election system to overcome social
confusion and achieve national compromise," Roh said.
    There was no immediate indication of how soon Chun would
react to Roh's proposals or whether he was involved in their
formulation.
    The president, who took office in 1980 following a military
coup, is due to step down next February after elections which
had tentatively been set for December.
    Under Roh's package, Chun would remain president until his
successor was chosen by direct elections. At present, the
president is chosen through an electoral college system which
the opposition says is stacked in favour of the DJP.
    Among other major changes, the package offers a release of
most political prisoners, a guarantee of human rights and a
free press.
    Kim Young-sam, head of the opposition Reunification
Democratic Party, said, "I wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Roh's
announcement, though it was a belated measure."
    A Western diplomat told Reuters "It's a very substantial,
very courageous move."
    The second surprise in Roh's proposals was an amnesty for
leading dissident Kim Dae-jung, who has been banned from
politics because of a suspended sentence for sedition charges.
    The only opposition demand which is not met by Roh's
package is the RDP's insistence that Chun should step down
immediately.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SEEKS MORE AGGRESSIVE DEBT ROLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank is prepared to play a
more aggressive role in promoting Third World development and
easing the debt crisis, bank president Barber Conable said.
    "We must be realistic about the immediate prospects for an
expansion in voluntary commercial bank lending, with the World
Bank playing an even more vigorous role in the debt crisis,"
Conable said in an interview with Newsweek magazine.
    Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt
crisis, which has prompted a number of U.S. Commercial banks to
write off a portion of their Third World loans.
    "Our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as
greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of
private investment in Third World countries through our
affiliate, the International Finance Corporation," Conable said.
"The bank is primarily a development institution, not a
debt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively or
it hampers development."
    Conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank,
which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting
bureaucracy. He added environmental considerations would play a
larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC has shown itself to be in control
of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
    They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
    "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
effect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oil
trader said.
    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expect
a weak market from now on."
    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "We
thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
production so the market will react very bullishly."
    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
requirements before October.
    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
    "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said an
international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
bullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
how much they (OPEC members) cheat."
    A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating and
leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
no need to worry about shortages."
    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
factor to be considered.
    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
quiet on minimal buying interest.
    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Producers, news writers, editors and
technicians began a strike at the National Broadcasting Co
(NBC), leaving management employees to do their jobs.
    The strike by members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees (NABET), representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000
workers, began at 12:01 A.M. (0401 GMT) after the network
imposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable.
    The union said its main objection to the contract was that
it permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.
    The average salary of workers represented by NABET is
65,000 dlrs a year.
    Union officials said management was being intransigent and
blamed General Electric &lt;GE>, which purchased NBC and its
parent company RCA in 1985 in a flurry of communications
company takeovers.
    The strike is the first for NBC since 1976.
    The two sides said they have set no time to meet again.

spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
official price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refiner
said.
    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
U.K. Brent, traders said.
    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
grades further," said a Japanese oil trader.
    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
market has further upward potential in the short term, having
risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said
one international oil trader in Tokyo.
    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
back up again pretty quickly," he added.
    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason to
expect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC to
raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
maintain steady prices.
    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
too high too fast.
    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
barrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
too much," an oil industry analyst said.

Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said.

agreement for its bid for &lt;JWT Group Inc> by increasing its
offer, said it would raise its planned rights issue to raise
213 mln stg instead of 177 mln to finance the deal.
    On Friday the two groups said they had agreed to merge
after WPP raised its cash price to 55.5 dlrs a share from 45.0
dlrs, valuing JWT at 566 mln dlrs.
    Under the new rights proposals, WPP shareholders could
apply for new ordinary shares at 875p each on a two-for-one
basis.
    The issue has been underwritten. The remainder of the
purchase price would come from a loan facility of up to 260 mln

    The issue and the proposed acquisition of JWT remain
conditional on the approval of shareholders.
    The original proposal for the rights issue was on the basis
of five new shares for every three held. The revised version
would involve the issue of up to 24.3 mln new shares,
representing 65 pct on the enlarged fully diluted share
capital.
    WPP shares were quoted at 0757 GMt unchanged at 10.70 stg.

<TITLE>SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,
Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic
Port.

    The offer would be on the basis of three Willis shares for
every two in Stewart, valuing each Stewart share at about
655.5p.
    Willis already owns 2.05 mln shares, or 4.62 pct, and has

247,469 shares.
    Full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of
66.2 mln new Willis shares, or 28.2 pct of the enlarged total.
    The companies said the proposed merger would bring together
businesses that were largely complementary. Both believed the
combination would permit more effective competition throughout
the world and enahnce the service provided to clients.
    Following the merger, the two companies saw significant
opportunities for growth in brokerage income and considerable
scope for improved operating efficiency.
    Willis shares were suspended on Friday at 437p. When
trading restarted they dropped sharply to 393p.
    Stewart Wrightson shares rose to 576p at 0835 gmt from a
suspension price of 499p.

<TITLE>N.Z. OPPOSITION PARTY UNVEILS ECONOMIC POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's opposition National
Party said it would cut personal and business taxes and would
not regulate or control interest rates if returned to power.
    The economic strategy was unveiled by party leader Jim
Bolger one day before prime minister David Lange announces the
date of general elections, widely expected to be August 15.
    The National Party's tax policies included the abolition of
death and gift duties and the removal of indirect taxes on
basic food and doctors' fees.
    The most recent opinion poll, taken on June 20, gave Labour
a 26 point lead over National or eight points more than a month
earlier.
    National said that under its administration the New Zealand
dollar would find its level with "complementary fiscal and
monetary policies." The party did not elaborate.
    Controversy over National's economic policy erupted in
March when former prime minister Robert Muldoon said the party
had adopted a policy of a managed exchange rate.
    Bolger said then that the National Party would continue to
float the dollar.
    Since the dollar was floated by the Labour Party in March
1985 it has risen about 34 pct, cutting the export incomes of
farmers, who are traditional National Party supporters.
    The party said tight monetary policies alone would lead to
unrealistic exchange rates which would be out of line for
exporters unless they were supported by a low government
borrowing requirement, a shrinking government sector and
positive growth.
    It aimed to keep aspects of deregulation which have
benefitted New Zealanders while cutting government spending,
unemployment, interest rates, inflation and tax.
    The National Party intends to privatise totally the &lt;Bank
of New Zealand>, &lt;Development Finance Corporation>, &lt;Tourist
Hotel Corporation>, &lt;Petrocorp>, &lt;State Insurance> and
&lt;Government Life Office>, the party said.
    Other candidates for privatisation, such as &lt;Air New
Zealand Ltd>, would be considered when the share market could
absorb them.

<TITLE>NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
told Reuters.
    "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"
he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil
market and we shall continue making our contribution."
    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

rate of four ordinary shares for every 15 convertibles held.
    On full conversion, the issued ordinary share capital of
the company would increase by some 64 pct.
    &lt;Birdcage Walk Ltd>, a company controlled by the Walker

    Brent would buy the casino companies and the freehold of
45, Park Lane in London. Under the arrangements, it would also
arrange for the repayment of 6.45 mln stg in inter-company
debt.
    Brent Walker shares firmed sharply on the announcement to
385p from 353p at Friday's close, while Lonrho also firmed, to
275p from 265.5p.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN DETERMINED TO KEEP EASY MONEY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen
in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements
today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
policy, central bank officials said.
    "Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
the fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a senior
central bank official told Reuters.
    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
interbank market today, the officials said.
    The central bank was concerned about growing market
expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
the officials said.
    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
was 3.75 pct, they said.
    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
    "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
market expectation of higher rates will remain.
    "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay
above four pct for the time being," he said.

34-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 3.
    The other 200 billion yen will yield 3.6003 pct in 43-day
repurchase accords maturing on August 12.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.6503 pct in
50-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 19.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.5625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 3.6250 pct on
two-month bills.
    They attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1,900
billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments
and public bodies.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO HELP U.S. ON ANTI-SUBMARINE DEFENCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has agreed to help the United States
strengthen anti-submarine defences after illegal
high-technology Japanese exports significantly damaged mutual
security, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.
    Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanese
machines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harder
to detect had been a serious blow. But he said he was
encouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co, a
subsidiary of Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, for the illegal exports,
and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances that
action would be taken to keep it from happening again.
    The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting to
Communist countries for a year and said it intends to
strengthen and expand its export control system.
    Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program.
    In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara,
he said, he made a pitch for American companies seeking to
build Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's.
    "I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans to
increase Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believe
American aircraft can do this," he said. The Japanese industry
argues it should develop the fighter plane on its own.

<TITLE>THAI MINISTER SAYS PREM MAY DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A split in the Thai government's main
coalition party may prompt Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to
dissolve parliament soon, Interior Minister Prachuab
Suntharangun said.
    He told reporters that Prem was considering new elections
because squabbling in the Democrat Party undermined government
performance and held up legislation Prem wanted passed.
    But Prem was reluctant to call new elections or reshuffle
his cabinet because that too would be likely to result in a
wobbly multi-party coalition, Prachuab said. He declined to say
how soon parliament might be dissolved.
    The Democrats, one of four parties in the ruling coalition,
have been split ever since winning 100 of the parliament's 347
seats in elections in July 1986.
    The current coalition was formed last August and
constitutes a hefty parliamentary majority. But the Democrats'
inability to work well together or with their coalition
partners has made the government vulnerable to the small but
more cohesive opposition.
    Parliament closed the first of its two annual sessions this
month and is scheduled to reconvene in September.

<TITLE>BHP STEEL SEES BENEFITS FROM INVESTMENT IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The major benefits of BHP Steel
International Group's big capital expenditure program should
begin to be seen in its 1988 financial year ending next May 31,
Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> officials said.
    A decline in BHP Steel's net profit to 200.02 mln dlrs in
the 1987 year ended May 31, 1987, from 253.87 mln the year
before, contributed to the drop in attributable group earnings
to 820.27 mln dlrs from 988.20 mln.
    "We look forward to a 1988 year of consolidation while
continuing our strong business development initiatives," BHP
Steel chief executive officer David Rice told reporters.
    Rice said BHP Steel's capital spending in 1987 totalled 701
mln dlrs, and that total expenditure would be about 1.4 billion
dlrs by the time the government's five-year Steel Industry Plan
expires at the end of calendar 1988.
    He said the investment program, aimed at making BHP Steel
both technically and commercially competitive on a world scale,
was now over its peak and would begin to scale down.
    Operational and commissioning problems flowing from the
investment program, combined with the highest levels of
industrial action since the steel plan started, had contributed
to the decline in 1987 earnings, he said.
    Rice said the industrial and production problems forced BHP
Steel to import 280,000 tonnes of steel in its 1987 financial
year to keep faith with customers.
    The new items of plant are now past their initial teething
problems and talks have intensified with the unions on the
industrial troubles, he said.
    Despite the profit drop in the 1987 year, BHP Steel
International group was one of the most profitable steel
producers in the world on an after-tax basis, he said.
    Its capacity utilisation was far higher, at 89 pct, than
the current western world average of 69 pct, he added.

<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
paid a brief weekend visit to the Ivory Coast during which he
discussed the country's economic difficulties with President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
    Camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in more
pleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the official
Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin.
    He added that the extremely steep fall in agricultural
commodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to the
Ivorian economy and because of this the country was
experiencing a growth problem and difficulties with its
international debt.
    Last month the Ivory Coast informed its creditors it had to
suspend payments on its foreign debt, estimated at more than
eight billion dlrs.
    Camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of the
Ivory Coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effort
between the country itself, the commercial banks, other
governments and international finance institutions.
    He also disussed problems of developing countries in
general with banking and government officials in Abidjan.

<TITLE>ZIMBABWE WAGE FREEZE SHOWS ECONOMIC MALAISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Rusinga, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zimbabwe's temporary freeze on salaries,
wages and prices will give the economy a breather, but radical
economic reforms are needed to resuscitate business and attract
foreign investment, economists said.
    They said the June 24 freeze on government, state company
and private sector wages until January 1988 has postponed,
rather than provided, solutions to Zimbabwe's economic
problems.
    They urged a review of the tax system, the introduction of
investment incentives, a review of foreign exchange and price
controls and a check on government expenditure.
    These measures would aim to stimulate investment and create
employment for the 100,000 school leavers annually seeking
jobs.
    The freeze, which Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero said
would check production costs and reduce the budget deficit, has
been partly welcomed by business but criticised by workers
whose real purchasing power has been severely eroded since
1980.
    The government announced the freeze amid a worsening
economic crisis caused by serious drought, a budget deficit of
more than one billion Zimbabwean dlrs and an acute balance of
payments problem owing to debt service costs, now 357 mln U.S.
Dlrs on an external debt of two billion U.S. Dlrs.
    The crisis has forced the country to make companies halve
dividend remittances to overseas shareholders.
    The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce supported the
freeze on wages and salaries but criticised the promised
stricter control of prices of goods and services.
    "If those companies whose costs of production increase are
not allowed a price increase, profit margins will again be
severely squeezed, and this would negate current government
efforts to revitalise the economy," the chamber said.
    The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said the freeze would
worsen the plight of the lowest paid workers.
    The union body has been campaigning for a minimum monthly
wage of 277 Zimbabwean dlrs (165 U.S. Dlrs). The lowest paid
now earn about 100 dollars (60 U.S. Dlrs).
    "Inflation is hitting hardest those in the low income
bracket which demands that any economic recovery programme
should be biased in their favour," the union body said.
    It added that the promised price freeze was "bolting the
stable door when in fact the horse is gone" because prices of
most basic commodities had already risen phenomenally.
    Both unions and business hope that the freeze heralds a
return to wage bargaining between workers and employers, rather
than government-regulated pay awards.
    Zimbabwe has, since 1980, set annual minimum wages for
different sectors of the economy and awarded wage and salary
increments on a sliding scale which gave higher increases to
the lowest paid.

<TITLE>BANKS IN SINGAPORE SET TO INCREASE SECURITISATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tay Liam Hwee, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banks in Singapore are planning to
further expand their treasury, securities, equities and debt
instruments activities in line with global financial markets,
bankers and economists told Reuters.
    "Banks are moving towards treasury activities because they
see them as a vital link in global capital and foreign exchange
markets," Clemente Escano, vice-president of Union Bank of
Switzerland, said.
    Central to that link is the Asian Dollar Market's pool of
funds, with deposits estimated at 212 billion dlrs in March.
    Banks are fond of booking and tapping offshore Asian Dollar
Market funds here for a variety of reasons, including low
taxes.
    New impetus has come to this market with growth of 52
billion dlrs in the year to March partly due to the
liberalisation of financial markets in Japan leading to an
increase in interbank activity, bankers said.
    Despite the slowdown in traditional loan syndications in
the region, the offshore market has continued to grow as banks
rebundle and securitise their assets, creating new generations
of tradeable debt instruments, bankers said.
    Singapore's daily turnover in foreign exchange dealing has
increased to 30 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1987 against 21 billion
last year, according to Finance Minister Richard Hu.
    Susumu Sakaguchi, manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the
22 Japanese banks in Singapore were expanding their foreign
exchange departments, which accounted for at least 30 to 40 pct
of total bank activities last year.
    Sakaguchi said the liberalisation of the Toyko market
stimulated Asian Dollar deposits and foreign exchange turnover
and is leading to active Japanese futures trading on the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange.
    Robin Tomlin, managing director of Singapore International
Merchant Bankers Ltd, said international merchant banks cluster
in Singapore because of the tax incentives, presence of major
players and shift in regional capital flows.
    Tomlin pegged much of the future of the Singapore banking
industry to securities and equities.
    "In 1988 we should see an expansion of securities trading
following the link-up" of the Stock Exchange of Singapore
Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ) with the London
exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ), he said.
    Equity and equity-linked issues have dominated the
financial markets here to date because of buoyant domestic and
international stock markets. Tomlin said privatisation
programmes, both in Singapore and abroad, would encourage huge
flows of capital through the banks.
    Applications received for the 30 mln Singapore Airline
shares offered last week were worth 601.1 mln Singapore dlrs.
The share offer by Sembawang Maritime Ltd raked in a record 6.8
billion Singapore dlrs in May this year.
    Bankers said Singapore's privatisations and links with
exchanges abroad showed its determined international stance.
    Singapore's four major local banks have been venturing into
stockbroking, the new government securities market and SESDAQ,
competing successfully for business with the merchant banks.
    Tomlin said merchant banks will continue to play an
important role in the Singapore domestic capital markets but
the modest size of the total market would limit the potential
of new entrants.
    Bankers said a total of 650 mln U.S. Dlrs was raised in the
Singapore capital market last year and the volume of new issues
would to grow in 1987.
    Total lending by banks in Singapore fell by 1.04 billion
dlrs in March 1987 compared with last year following the trend
towards asset management services and other capital market
activities.
    Hans-Rudolf Schaub, the senior vice-president and manager
of Swiss Bank Corp, said his bank has chosen Singapore as its
Asian treasury centre because of favourable tax rules for
offshore banks, political stability and economic growth.
    He said the bank might set up a securities portfolio
management service here in addition to its existing links in
international money market services with Zurich and New York.

banks will sign formal documents in mid-July to restructure
part of its debt, the Central Bank said.
    A spokesman told reporters the documents would formalise
the agreement reached in March on the restructuring of 10.3
billion dlrs, out of a total foreign debt of 28.2 billion.
    The interest rate spread agreed was 7/8 of a percentage
point over LIBOR. The spokesman gave no date for the signing.
    Manila had demanded a renegotiation after Argentina won a
13/16 of a percentage point spread, but it later dropped this
demand.

<TITLE>EC PRESIDENCY PREPARED TO DROP OILS AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgium, current holder of the European
Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial
oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price
package, diplomats said.
    In a discussion document prepared for today's summit
meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called
"stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study and
consultation with the Community's main trading partners."
    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on
both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine
oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.
    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at
the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price
talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the
measure.
    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on
June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are
supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser
extent, Spain.
    Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats
said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a
further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.

<TITLE>BAHRAIN BANKS WILL RETURN TO SIX DAY WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bahrain's 19 commercial banks have been
instructed by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) to return to a
six day working week with effect from July 4.
    A circular sent to the banks today reverses a shift in
early April to a five day week and follows three months of
controversy within the domestic banking sector over hours.
    A BMA spokesman said the circular, which does not affect
offshore banks, represented a "compromise solution" between
differing views within the industry and was drawn up following
the agency's own survey of banks, staff and customers.
    In April the BMA allowed commercial banks to operate a five
day week from Sunday to Thursday. Banks have since been closed
on Fridays, the Islamic weekend, and Saturdays.
    The new regulation will require banks to work from 7.30
A.M. To 12 noon from Saturday to Thursday inclusive. Banks may
open on these days during the afternoon between 3.30 and 5.30.
    The regulations apply to bank opening hours, not to staff
working hours, which continue to be decided by banks.
    Under the five day week introduced in early April, banks
have been obliged to open from 8 A.M. Until noon and from 3.30
to 5.30 P.M.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN WORRIES ABOUT MARKET COLLAPSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan has become increasingly
worried about a possible crash of high-flying financial
markets, Bank of Japan sources said.
    "We're afraid that someday the bubble will burst and that
the deflationary impact on the economy will be very disastrous,"
one source said.
    They said the central bank has embarked on a delicate
policy -- it wants to deflate the speculation that has pumped
up prices sharply in recent months without bursting the bubble.
    Stock prices plunged 393.31 points today, extending the
sharp declines of earlier this month, as the market speculated
that interest rates would rise.
    The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of
deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its
determination to maintain an easy money policy, central bank
officials said.
    Today's CD buying operation was designed to reassure the
market the Bank has not changed its policy, a senior central
Bank official told Reuters.
    "There is a possibility that a deflationary impact would
permeate the economy if the prices of existing assets
collapsed," the Bank of Japan said earlier this month in its
annual economic report.
    Such a possibility has been heightened by what the Bank
sees as excessive speculation in stock, bond and land prices.
    Over the last two years, the stock market average has
doubled, driving price/earnings ratios to over 70, compared
with about 15 on Wall Street. Bond yields have dropped sharply,
while land prices in Tokyo have soared.
    The excessive speculation means the markets are
increasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more
vulnerable, one central bank source said.
    A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what
little confidence they have in the economy after the
yen-induced recession of the past year, private economists
said.
    Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profits
through financial dealings than from their basic businesses,
they said.
    "There seems to be an accelerated demand for money to
support transactions in shares, bonds, land and other existing
assets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on
GNP," the Bank of Japan said in its report.
    The increased inclination of investors to seek capital
gains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets
could have dangerous implications for the economy, it added.
    In the Bank's view, a major reason behind skyrocketing
prices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the
market that interest rates were heading inexorably lower.
    Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by
excessive liquidity, the Central Bank's board recently decided
it had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further
discount rate cut was not in the offing, one source said.
    But the bank had to do that without tightening monetary
policy and running the risk of a market collapse.
    This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interest
rates, which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to
a change in market expectations.
    While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy, a
senior source welcomed the change in market expectations.
    The source acknowledged the shift may have been caused
partly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit
lending in the July/September period. Faster than expected
economic growth and a strong dollar also played a part.
    In the longer run, the Central Bank is counting on a
gradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the
financial markets into productive areas like capital spending,
one Bank of Japan economist said.
    But while it waits for that to occur over the next six
months, it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary
policy that could collapse the market and lead to recession.

<TITLE>BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, June 28 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
luxury cars.
    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
reporters.
    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
government were not included in the policy, they added.
    They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
economy.
    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export
earnings" in the coming year.
    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
in 1986/87, according official figures.
    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>China and Australia's Victoria state
signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium
processing plant in China that will export to South Korea,
Australian officials told journalists.
    China has no official direct trade or government ties with
Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.
    China International Trust and Investment Corporation
(CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in &lt;Bohai Aluminium
Industries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and
extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.
    It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said.
    "A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating
markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),"
Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.
    An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South
Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is
growing but is not officially publicised.
    Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,
will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is
intended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium
smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in
Portland.
    The China-based joint venture would process Portland
aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic
Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.
    The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22
mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key
managers, he said.
    Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated
by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment
in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of
independence from Peking's central government and has extensive
overseas investments.

<TITLE>NORWAY CENTRAL BANK SELLS CROWNS TO EASE PRESSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's central bank sold crowns in the
open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the
currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket
of currencies, dealers said.
    The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the
bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on
Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain
levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.
    "They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal
whenever they think necessary," a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,
who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
    The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket
-- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is
committed to defending.
    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.
The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.
    The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest
rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better
than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply
reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising
around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

<TITLE>HIGHER REVENUES DEAL BLOW TO JAPAN TAX REFORM PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt
a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax
revenues in 1986/87, government officials said.
    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to
provide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts
promised in the government's emergency economic package last
month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the
1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than
expected.
    That means the government should have more than enough
money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the
planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax
measures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.
    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the
abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising
revenue to offset the tax cuts.
    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of
an indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to
gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on
small savings.
    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed
from increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as
prices of both shares and land soared, one official said.
    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than
expected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year
induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.
    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be
released by the Finance Ministry on July 1.
    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut
attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce
investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89
budget, several officials said.
    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to
stick with its so-called "minus-ceiling" policy, which calls for
government departments to reduce investment spending by five
pct a year.
    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the
sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic
and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.

<TITLE>VW SUFFERS IMAGE LOSS IN WAKE OF CURRENCY SCANDAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Anthony Williams, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share analysts and commentators say
Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> has suffered an enormous loss of face
from which it could take time to recover over its 473 mln mark
currency swindle.
    An auditors' report on the affair, prepared in time for
this week's annual shareholders' meeting, largely cleared the
management of Volkswagen of blame.
    But "mud sticks," said Gavin Launder, an analyst with
Scrimgeour Vickers in London.
    (See index on ECRA)
    The financial daily, Boersenzeitung, wrote in a commentary:
"More devastating than the losses linked to the currency scandal
is the resulting loss of image for the company."
    VW had to make provisions of 473 mln marks to cover losses
from unauthorised foreign exchange deals which the auditors,
Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft, said highlighted major gaps in
the supervisory apparatus of the firm's financial department.
    The auditors' report highlighted failings in VW's
controlling system, especially in relation to a 385 mln mark
deal with the Hungarian National Bank, but shed little light on
why they were made. 
    It said the contracts did not benefit VW and were only
advantageous to its banks. It did not detail how the foreign
exchange dealers may have profitted.
    It concluded: "The nature, scope and technical construction
of the deals ... Suggest a targeted and professionally executed
manipulation to the detriment of VW."
    The head of the finance department, Rolf Selowsky, resigned
days after the scandal broke in March. He is not accused of any
wrongdoing, but auditors concluded he had "not applied the
necessary diligence in all instances."
    Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested.
    But even VW admits that the report, published last week,
revealed important company failings.
    Peter Frerk, who has temporarily taken over Selowsky's
reponsibilities, said the findings were "not a first class
acquittal." The currency swindle was a "lamentable event for our
company," he told journalists.
    The auditors said the remaining members of VW's management
board and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled their
obligations, a verdict which almost certainly means that major
West German banks, who vote on behalf of large numbers of
shareholders, will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting.
    Many market analysts, especially in London, do not believe
a sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a major
reassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report.
    The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday, up 11 pct from a
week earlier. Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting,
and one London broker said "I'm not sure it's much of a bargain."
Most brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy at
these levels.
    Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 group
net profit of 582 mln marks this year, and one broker in London
said the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pct
down.
    VW is expected to fare very well both in its home market
and in Europe. But sales have fallen sharply in the U.S and
Brazil, where the latest price freeze could exacerbate results
even further.
    The company hopes to benefit in the long term from its
takeover of the Spanish company SEAT, but this subsidiary is
still producing losses.
    VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-up
trucks with Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> at an under-utilised
plant in Hanover, but analysts noted production here was only
expected to take off fully in 1990.

<TITLE>EC, U.S. REMAIN DIVIDED OVER PASTA DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top-level talks last week between the
European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve
a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next
month, diplomatic sources said.
    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an
unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and
dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy
taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.
    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies
of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.
    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has
returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline
for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a
related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.
    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was
also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC
pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.
    But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a
few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans
Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.

said fertilisers would rise by an average 50 pct, animal feeds
by 38 pct and tractors by 25 pct.

<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community agriculture
ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a
two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt
to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission
spokesman said.
    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain
notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical
nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the
ministers reach an accord.
    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but
said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC Farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the
case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.
    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of
ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC
sources said.
    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices
by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources
said.
    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still
split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and
marine oils and fats.
    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for
cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency
system.
    Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder
of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the
plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.

<TITLE>DEGUSSA PLANS ONE-FOR-FIVE RIGHTS ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Degussa AG &lt;DGSG.F> said it planned a
one-for-five rights issue at 225 marks per share, raising
nominal share capital by 61 mln marks, by the end of its
current business year ending September 30.
    The company said in a statement it would also raise nominal
share capital by 20 mln marks in a share swap as part of its
planned takeover of French medicine group &lt;Laboratoires Sarget
SA>.
    The two capital measures will raise Degussa nominal share
capital to 365 mln marks.
    Degussa said last week it intended to buy 100 pct of the
capital of the medical pharmaceuticals group Sarget, based in
Merignac near Bordeaux.
    Sarget had 1986 sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Spain, Portugal and Italy of 730 mln French francs.
    Degussa has not said how much it would pay for Sarget, but
20 mln marks nominal of 50-mark shares, at today's Frankfurt
opening price of 494.70 marks, would be worth nearly 198 mln
marks.
    A 61 mln mark nominal capital increase at 225 marks would
raise 274.5 mln marks.
    Degussa said the 20 mln mark nominal capital increase would
take the form of an issue of shares for a non-cash
consideration. The April 10 annual meeting agreed that there
would be no rights issue on this capital, which was already
authorized but unissued.
    The rights issue involving the 61 mln mark nominal capital
increase will be led by Dresdner Bank AG. Following that
capital increase, Degussa would be left with 19 mln marks of
authorized but unissued capital, a Degussa spokesman said.
    Part of the 274.5 mln marks from the rights issue would
also be used for the Serget acquisition, he added.

net profit of 11 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1988,

    Sales in 1987/88 are expected to rise 6.4 pct from a year

    The company earlier reported group net profit of 10.95
billion yen in 1986/87, down 29.2 pct from a year earlier.
Sales were 0.3 pct down at 592.37 billion, due to reduced
exports caused by the yen's appreciation against the dollar.
    Ricoh's exports, accounting for 34.2 pct of total sales
against 39.6 pct a year earlier, fell 13.8 pct from a year
earlier to 202.83 billion yen in 1986/87, while domestic sales
rose 8.7 pct to 389.55 billion.

<TITLE>CANADA THREATENS BAN ON DANISH PIGMEAT IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada has threatened to stop imports
of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary
inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish
agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the
request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached
for support.
    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an
interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will not
accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach
an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."
    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns
in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community
totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion
that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC
veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said
the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC
regulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about the
trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the
EC and bilaterally," she added.

<TITLE>EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following are extracts from the
communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
here.
    "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
distributed into national production levels.
    "The conference noted that all market indicators, including
spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."
    "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
the same national production levels as were defined by the
above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."
    "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
in order to secure price stability around the opec price
structure.
    "Should there be any significant change in market prices,
the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
year, which would secure the desired market stability."
    "The conference reiterated the necessity of member
countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
levels.
    "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
terms of the agreement."

    "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
stability.
    The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
(extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
    "The conference observed the continued fall in the value of
the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
and reported to the next meeting of the conference."

    "The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next
ordinary meeting.
    "The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil
al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year
from October 7, 1987.
    "The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be
convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987."

<TITLE>POEHL SPEAKS AGAINST GERMAN INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
six-month lull.
    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be
badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
    "This could, under certain circumstances, release new
inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
higher interest rates," he added.

    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past
six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
finds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect this
development to continue in the coming months."
    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community
trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
    "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by
protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "This
includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far
as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."

<TITLE>ARGENTINE MINISTER TO SEEK RELEASE OF LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine Economy Minister Juan
Sourrouille left at the weekend for the United States for talks
with creditor banks and the IMF aimed at obtaining the release
of new loans, the semi-official news agency Telam said.
    It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mln
dlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the first
two tranches of a standby loan, totalling 450 mln dlrs.
    Release of the funds from the standby loan has been delayed
by Argentina's failure to win final approval to a 1.95 billion
dlr loan from creditor banks, which was a condition for the IMF
disbursement.
    Banks have pledged 97 pct of the 1.95 billion dlr loan but
the IMF has not yet defined what amount constitutes the
"critical mass," which is needed for release of the IMF funds and
the funds from creditor banks.
    The president of Argentina's bank steering committee,
William Rhodes of Citibank, said on Friday he thought the loan
agreement with Argentina could be signed in August.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
target.
    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third
quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"
    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
levels would have on prices.
    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
September.
    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
mln in the second half.
    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will
not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.
    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a
meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.
    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
at the meeting.

    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I
would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
relative to heavy crudes."
    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
the work of another minister."
    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

<TITLE>IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq has rejected its new OPEC
production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this
year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
    It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who
returned Sunday, as saying "Iraq will continue to adhere to its
position considering itself as not included in the agreement."

    Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987
quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255
mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly
seven-year-old Gulf war.
    The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set
an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members
from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and
Iran's to 2.369 mln.

<TITLE>FRENCH CHANNEL TF-1 PRESIDENT SEES PROFIT IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 28 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-run television channel
TF-1, which is in the process of being privatised, should
achieve a profit of around 25 francs per share next year after
several years of losses, but will not make a profit this year,
the new TF-1 president Francis Bouygues said.
    Interviewed on TF-1 on the eve of the public flotation of
40 pct of the channel's equity, Bouygues said "in 1988 we have
to make a profit, and we will make a profit."
    "I envisage per share profits of 25 francs," he said. "I am
very optimistic."

    Bouygues said exceptional costs associated with the
restructuring of the station would prevent a profit this year.
    The state sold a 50 pct stake in TF-1 in April to a
consortium led by Bouygues, a construction magnate, and
including British press baron Robert Maxwell.
    Tomorrow 40 pct of the shares go on sale to the public at
165 francs each, while 10 pct will be offered at a special
price of 132 francs a share to the station's staff.
    Bouygues said a dividend would be paid to shareholders next
year if the station did return to profit.

    Asked if he thought the flotation price was right, Bouygues
said, "I paid virtually double...I consider that it is a good
buy."
    The Bouygues consortium paid three billion francs for its
50 pct controlling stake in April.
    After the two-week public flotation, TF-1 shares will start
trading on the second market here in late July.

    "I think we will maintain our buying power... I do not think
it will fall," Chirac told a radio interviewer yesterday. Last
year French household buying power rose 2.9 pct.
    Chirac said economic growth would be substantially lower
than originally forecast but investment would rise by close to
16 pct in the 1986 to 1988 period, reversing the 3.8 pct
decline in the previous four-year period.

<TITLE>HENKEL EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 TURNOVER, PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Henkel KGaA &lt;HNKG.F> expects 1987
world group turnover and profit to exceed 1986 levels as recent
acquisitions should compensate for the negative impact of the
strong mark, managing board chairman Helmut Sihler said.
    He told the annual meeting that based on Henkel's
performance so far, the profit increase would be "not
insignificant."
    World group sales rose six pct in the first five months
this year compared with the same 1986 period but group turnover
rose only two pct because of currency factors, he said.
    Sihler said the profit increase surpassed that of turnover
but gave no figure.
    As reported, group net profit rose 28 pct to 226 mln marks
in 1986. World group sales by volume rose six pct but currency
factors trimmed group turnover by six pct to 8.7 billion marks.
    Sihler said the 1986 profit/sales ratio of 2.6 pct should
rise further this year.
    Sihler said turnover grew more or less equally in all
sectors.
    As reported, the 1986 dividend on ordinary voting shares
rose to 4.50 marks from 3.50 in 1985 while the dividend on
non-voting preference shares increased to 7.50 marks compared
with three marks for six months of 1985.

<TITLE>IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
Fraternite Matin reported.
    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
said.
    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
been affected in some regions, it added.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
early development of the new main crop as patchy.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
4.33 mln bag harvest.
    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
crop as "normal."

<TITLE>BANGLADESH SHIPPING EMPLOYEES CALL OFF STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nearly 1,000 employees of Bangladesh
Shipping Corp called off their two-week-old strike on Saturday
after the authorities agreed to consider their demands for
higher wages and benefits, corporation officials said.
    The employees walked out on June 11 over their demands,
forcing the government-run corporation to engage navy personnel
to unload grain at the country's biggest Chittagong port.
    Anwarul Haq, director of the corporation, said the strikers
joined their work this morning after the authorities assured
them they would review their demands soon.

<TITLE>OLIVETTI SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN RADIOCOR BUSINESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ing C Olivetti EC SpA &lt;OLIV.MI> is in
contact with Telerate Inc &lt;TLR> of the U.S. And other,
unidentifed groups with a view to strengthening its economic
news agency business &lt;Radiocor - Agenzia Giornalistica
Economica Finanziaria SRL>, an Olivetti spokesman said.
    The spokesman was responding to a Reuters query following
an item in the Milan weekly Milano Finanza saying Dow Jones and
Co Inc &lt;DJ>, which has a controlling stake in Telerate, could
become a partner in Radiocor through subscribing to a capital
increase.

    The spokesman said that Telerate was among many companies
with which Olivetti was in contact, with a view to
strengthening Radiocor through the entry into the business of
new partners, but that no accord had been reached.
    He declined to identify the other companies involved, but
Milano Finanza named the owners of the Italian financial daily
Il Sole 24-Ore and &lt;Societa Elenchi Ufficiali degli Abbonati al
Telefono> as likely partners along with Telerate.

    Olivetti last month announced a joint information
technology deal with Societa Elenchi, which specialises in
publishing telephone and city directories, and the Italian
publishing group &lt;L'Espresso>.
    Olivetti chairman Carlo De Benedetti told the Olivetti
annual meeting last week that the entry of new partners into
Radiocor was planned, but he did not elaborate.
    Industry sources said they believed talks between Olivetti
and Telerate had been taking place for some months.

    Olivetti acquired a 76 pct stake in Radiocor last December
and has since increased its stake in the agency to 100 pct.
    The takeover was followed in May this year by the
acquisiton by De Benedetti's French holding company &lt;Cerus> of
a stake of around 35 pct in the French financial information
agency &lt;Dafsa>.
    In May, Cerus also acquired a 4.9 pct stake in the British
publishing and financial services group Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L>.

COLOMBIA OPTIMISTIC ON COFFEE QUOTAS
    repeat from late yesterday
    MEDELLIN, Colombia, June 28 - Colombia considers conditions
are favourable for reestablishing coffee export quotas, but
Brazil believes that difficulties remain with the United
States, coffee leaders from the two countries said.
    "Colombia considers that if the principal International
Coffee Organisation (ICO) members adopt a realistic and
objective approach, it will be possible to find a solution at
the next meeting in London," Colombian Coffee Federation
president Jorge Cardenas said at a coffee symposium.
    The symposium has raised hopes that producers would find a
common position on quota distribution before a September ICO
plenary meeting in London when quotas will be the main item on
the agenda.
    Cardenas, representing the world's second largest coffee
producer, said all producer countries as well as consumer
countries including the United States, Japan and the European
Community had expressed an interest in reestablishing quotas.
    However, the President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute
Jorio Dauster told Reuters that problems remained between the
United States and Brazil.
    "By the end of the February meeting it was shown that 85 pct
of the producer countries were with Brazil," he said.
    "However, up to now I have not seen fundamental changes in
their positions."
    ICO talks on quotas broke down in February largely due to a
conflict between the world's main producer Brazil and main
consumer the United States.
    ICO director Alexandre Beltrao said at the symposium that
conditions were right to discuss reestablishing export quotas.
He said the strong views of Brazil and United States expressed
in February had abated.
    "Confirmation of the bumper crop in Brazil is good for
prices and compels countries to seek agreement on basic quotas,"
Beltrao told Reuters.
    "Brazilian authorities have said the crop for 1987/88 coffee
season could be 35.2 mln 60 kg bags," he added.
    Beltrao spoke of the presence of new factors that work
against the stability of the ICO, created 25 years ago.
    "Foreign debt and as a result worse economic, political and
social conditions make the adoption of a national and
international coffee strategy more difficult," he said.
    The ICO board would meet in July to discuss these matters.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL SPOT OIL PRICES FIRM ON OPEC ACCORD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Karen Yates, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC's weekend decision to cut planned
oil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market
confidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year
and boosted international spot prices, oil traders said.
    Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel
higher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and
could continue their rise in the next few weeks, they said.
    The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC
ministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output
ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd).
    At its previous meeting in December, OPEC set a provisional
16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a
sharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back
up its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was
contemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spot
prices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's Brent
Blend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.
    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this
morning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35
dlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.
    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly
to news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies
later in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onset
of the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spot
prices.
    "There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth
quarters of this year" one trader said. "In the past three months
we have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from the
U.S., And I expect to see even higher prices" he added.
    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
in London, agreed.
    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious
in setting the new output ceilings. "There is now a great chance
that Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next
month," he said.
    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,
said over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the
year from just over 20 dlrs now.
    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of
80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brent
has held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.
    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by some
OPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.
    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement
because other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand
for the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd above
its assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further
500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in
September.
    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa
al-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be
well above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/ALTERNATIVES TO IBM SOFTWARE STANDARD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Catherine Arnst, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>In the fast paced personal computer
industry, millions can be made in six months, and such an
opportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalize
on the delay of a new IBM software standard.
    When International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> announced
its new generation of personal computers, the PS/2 family, in
April, it also decided to establish a new operating system for
the machines, a death sentence for the billions of dollars of
software now in use on the existing system.
    Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some
70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - most
industry analysts, and even IBM's competitors, expect that
within two years the new operating system, called OS/2, will be
as commonplace as the current standard, MS-DOS, is now.
    "By 1989, at least one half to 60 pct of all personal
computers will be sold with OS/2," predicted George Colony,
president of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc.
    But until then there is an opportunity, some analysts said,
for firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS, specialised
multi-tasking software packages and Unix, an alternative to
MS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T>
that has developed a following among engineers and the federal
government.
    OS-2, which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp, the
author of MS-DOS, will not be ready for another six months. IBM
said last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and
other software developers are skeptical, since delays in major
new software products are commonplace.
    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be
hindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors
alike, who would prefer to keep making products that work with
tried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, software
analyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.
    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, has
already said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq
president Rod Canion said recently their will be no "automatic
mass migration" to OS/2. "(Advanced MS-DOS) applications will
continue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2
will supply long after it becomes available," he said.
    Cubbage acknowledged that "it will probably be a year or
more before any really useful applications are available for
OS-2," creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. "But
there comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to
you," he said.
    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the
computer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new
computers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's
fast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the
sagging sales of the personal computer industry and already
gave a big boost to IBM.
    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were
shipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM
expect record pc sales ths year as a result.
    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since
the full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped
until a new operating system or other high level software is
available, analysts said.
    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,
or tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any
slowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long
strived for.
    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in
particular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking
program, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.
    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced
version of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in
September and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of
100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.

    Some software developers have said the the program,
designed for 80386-based personal computers, may even be
superior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications
without disruption.
     But several analysts commented that what users really want
is a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal
computers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by a
small Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. In
late spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,
multiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and
works on 80386-based computers.
    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first four
weeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 by
year end.
    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix
could be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once the
IVM system is available.
    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,
although it did say that it would announce a version of its
Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatible
operating system.
    But the federal government requires Unix compatability for
most of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that other
companies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM
systems.
    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that
is compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM's
computer specifically.
    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix
accepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system
has a chance to take off.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SETS HIGHER 1987/88 BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait, aided by the recovery in world
oil prices, announced a mildly expansionary budget for 1987/88
with a 3.3 pct rise in the deficit to 1.38 billion dinars.
    Oil revenues, slashed by some 40 pct in the original budget
for the 1986/87 year ending tomorrow, were forecast to rise 4.2
pct to 1.73 billion dinars in 1987/88, Finance Minister Jassim
al-Khorafi said.
    This would account for 87.2 pct of total estimated income
in the year starting on July 1 compared with 86.6 pct in
original 1986/87 estimates, the Kuwait News Agency Kuna quoted
him as saying.
    Spending by ministries and public institutions is forecast
to be 3.4 pct higher at 3.16 billion dinars in 1987/88 after an
11 pct cut in the current fiscal year's budget.
    In addition the government, as is usual, will transfer a
sum equal to 10 pct of total expected revenue to a special
savings reserve for future generations.
    The minister made no mention of how the deficit would be
covered. He also gave no actual outturn for spending and income
in 1986/87.

<TITLE>CHIRAC ATTACKS EC COMMISSION BUDGET PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has attacked
budget proposals made by the European Community's executive
Commission, saying they ignore efforts to cut spending, and
added that divisions over the issue would be hard to resolve at
this week's EC summit.
    The Commission has proposed radical changes in the way the
member countries contribute to the budget, suggesting payments
should be linked to economic output instead of tax revenue.
    But the richer northern nations such as Britain, West
Germany and France are insisting on stricter spending controls
before agreeing to any reform.
    "The proposals of the Commission, at the level they are
being made, are not compatible with the efforts which each of
our nations is making to reduce spending ... Therefore there is
a big problem," Chirac said in a radio interview.
    EC leaders would also try to resolve a dispute on reforms
of agricultural spending, largely to blame for an expected 5.7
billion dlr shortfall in the EC budget this year.
    Chirac said that West Germany, under pressure from its
powerful farm lobby, was alone in opposing reforms to the
common agricultural policy, while France shared a common
position on the issue with the 10 other EC states.

    Both ships will be inspected in Bahrain and may be repaired
by the Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard Co.
    The U.S. Frigate Stark, damaged last month in an Iraqi air
attack in the Gulf, left Bahrain early on Sunday and anchored
four miles off shore. The vessel is due to return shortly to
the U.S. for further repairs.

<TITLE>ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> FILES FOR CHAPTER 11</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, Wis., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allis-Chalmers Corp said the
company and its domestic affiliates filed voluntary petitions
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy
Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York.
    The company said its business units outside the United
States are not affected by the action.
    Allis-Chalmers said the rapid agreement was essential for
its restructuring plan, announced March 4.
    However, the company said, "agreement could not be worked
out within the short time frame available, and it was
determined that the only practical alternative was to obtain
court protection."
    "This protection enables us to keep on operating our
business in the ordinary course while affording us time to work
out our obligations and complete our operational restructure
strategy."
    Allis-Chalmers said the proposal announced in March called
for a complete restructuring of its obligations and capital
structure as well as major structural changes in operations.
    The company said funds generated by U.S. operations are
currently inadequate to meet its U.S. obligations, primarily
due to the carryover from discontinued and drastically
downsized businesses.
    It said funds produced by non-U.S. operations are not
readily available to help meet those obligations, which include
a health care program for retirees and debt service carried
over from the larger Allis-Chalmers of earlier years.
    Allis-Chalmers said its U.S. cash flow exceeded a negative
24 mln dlrs in 1986 and was a negative two mln dlrs in the
first quarter of 1987. The company has financed a portion of
its debt service and other obligations through sales of assets
and has relied on short-term waivers from its lenders to
prevent defaults on principal and interest payments.
    Because of Allis-Chalmers' financial position, it said, new
financing facilities were not available outside of Chapter 11,
adding substantially all U.S. assets other than inventory are
pledged as security for its debts.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>RYZHKOV CALLS FOR SOVIET ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
described the Soviet Union's economic management system as
obsolete and called on the Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament, to adopt a draft law on major economic reform.
    In a speech to the 1,500 member body, Ryzhkov said
excessive central control by Moscow-based ministries and
wasteful use of resources had led to a situation where 13 pct
of Soviet industrial enterprises were making a loss in 1986.
    He said the public faced acute food and housing problems
and a "shadow economy" was growing because the state could not
meet demand.
    He added that the USSR had failed to keep up with the
technology revolution.
    "The methods of the past system of economic management have
become obsolete," Ryzhkov declared. "The need for change is
evident and urgent."
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who set the tone last
week with a frank speech on the economy, was present during the
speech.
    The legislation outlined by Ryzhkov, formally called the
draft law on state enterprises, is expected to be approved by
the Supreme Soviet, to take effect next January 1.
    Under the law, all enterprises are to become financially
self-supporting by taking charge of income and outlay, with
wages tied to profit in order to increase worker incentive.
    Firms will compete for orders from the state, which are due
to decline as direct contracts between enterprises expand.
    Ryzhkov said the state planning agency, Gosplan, would be
restructured to set national economic priorities instead of
administering factories directly through five year plans.
    "We need a fundamentally new approach to yearly planning," he
added, saying annual central plans would be abandoned from 1991
and enterprises charged with developing their own plans.

    He said scientific research should be integrated closely
with industry to make up a technology gap with the West and
enterprises should use market research to meet consumer demand.
    Ryzhkov blamed the state supply body, Gossnab, for allowing
shortages to occur. He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billion
roubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products of
enterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesale
trade.
    Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goods
and services was required to stem increasing speculation and
the growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 fold
increase in the number of cooperatives to help in this field.
    He said the price system needed radical revision to
accurately reflect supply and demand, with the state setting
prices only for "products of national importance" in changes to
be fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991.
    The practice of using credit to cover losses must also
stop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billion
roubles.
    He said there were proposals to replace the "cumbersome"
banking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks for
foreign economic relations, agro-industry, construction,
housing and commercial services, and credit.
    Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law to
prevent "the distortion of the rights of enterprises." But
non-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt if
efforts to make them self-supporting failed.
    Bemoaning the "economic illiteracy" of many managers, he
called for the retraining of economic personnel.
    Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and "doing
it on the go" would be difficult, but added, "We do not have time
to stop and ponder."
    He said the changes should "give a new image to socialism."

<TITLE>GERMAN 1987 TRADE SURPLUS SEEN STAYING HIGH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Anthony Williams, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's foreign trade and current
account surpluses are expected to decline only slightly in 1987
from their record levels last year, economists said.
    Figures released by the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden showed that in the first five months of the year the
trade surplus grew 15.7 pct compared with the same 1986 period
to 47.2 billion marks. The current account surplus rose 9.8 pct
to 33.7 billion marks.
    West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77
billion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.
    Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-ago
levels to have started biting more strongly into the nominal
surpluses.
    The real surpluses are already declining. The Statistics
Office said after cheaper import prices were taken into
consideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by more
than three pct in the first five months.
    Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. The
government has pointed to this stronger real rise in imports
than exports when rejecting international pressure to boost
domestic consumption.
    The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus had
risen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in April
and 8.1 billion in May last year.
    The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marks
in May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a year
earlier.
    Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to
43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion marks
had risen only 0.8 pct in the year.
    The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in a
study published today that the trade surplus would probably
only fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared with
the 113 billion mark 1986 record.
    It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61
billion marks from 77 billion.
    Ifo said this reduction would only be "a small step on the
way to reducing imbalances in the world economy."
    Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicted
a 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightly
higher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion
marks.
    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987
trade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current account
surplus at 60 billion marks.
    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-ago
period was surprising but it probably reflected calendar
factors.

<TITLE>SEC SEEKS COURT REVIEW OF TEXACO &lt;TX> CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texaco Inc said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission will urge the Texas Supreme
Court to accept the Texaco, Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> case for review
with respect to Commission Rule 10b-13 as it applies to the
facts of the case.
    Texaco said it is pleased and encouraged by the SEC's
decision, pointing out "Pennzoil's own counsel told the trial
court that 'If Rule 10B-13 was an impediment, then in fact our
contract was void' and further that, if the alleged contract
was void, "we have no case.'"
    In a letter dated June 26, the SEC's general counsel told
attorneys representing Texaco and Pennzoil the commission will
urge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federal
securities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case, Texaco said.
    "This is to inform you that the commission has determined
to file a brief amicus curiae in the (Texaco-Pennzoil)
litigation. The brief will focus on Commission Rule 10b-13 as
it applies to the facts of this case, and will urge the Texas
Supreme Court to accept the case for review with respect to
that issue," the letter said.
    The SEC's general counsel said, "we currently anticipate
that the brief will be filed around the week of July 20."
    An issue concerning SEC Rule 10b-13 is part of Texaco's
application for a Writ of Error, which was filed with the Texas
Supreme Court on June 15, the company said.
    "The SEC rule prohibits private agreements or arrangements
to purchase a target company's stock while a tender offer by a
prospective purchaser is pending," the company's statement said.
   
    In its application to the Texas Supreme Court, Texaco said,
it points out that "on the day that Pennzoil made its alleged
agreement to purchase Getty Oil stock (Jan. 3, 1984), it
(Pennzoil) had outstanding a public tender offer for Getty Oil
stock."

    The department revised April sales downward to show a 1.0

lowest point since December, 1984, when 597,000 units were
sold, the department said.
    Home sales in May were 20.7 pct below the May, 1986, level
of 777,000, the department said.
    Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually
sold in May totaled 58,000, down from 71,000 in April and
75,000 in May a year ago.
    The average price was 129,600 dlrs in May, up from 117,500

<DATELINE>    PORT LOUIS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mauritian Finance Minister Seetanah
Lutchmeenmaraidoo said the island's first offshore bank could
open in January 1988.
    The minister was announcing the creation of a committee of
eight economists to look at ways of encouraging foreign
investment, especially offshore banking.
    The committee, part of the government's plans to make
Mauritius an international financial centre, is expected to
submit its recommendations within three months.
    Lutchmeenmaraidoo also circulated a white paper on
legislation to set up a stock exchange on the island.
    He said the exchange would be a powerful instrument of
economic democratisation and the legislation would include
incentives to encourage shareholding by a wide public.
    The government would also introduce a bill to protect
investors and set up a vigilance committee with powers to
suspend any company from the stock exchange, halt trading in
its shares and take punitive measures for illegal practices.
    The stock exchange would probably become fully operational
in the next five to 10 years, he added.

<TITLE>PENNWALT &lt;PSM> INTRODUCES NEW REFRIGERANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennwalt Corp said it is making a
new refrigerant available as an alternative to
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) 12, a product suspected of depleting
the earth's ozone layer.
    The company said the new product, called isotron 142b/22,
is a blend of partially halogenated CFCs, and has less than
five pct of the ozone depletion potential of CFC 12, which is
fully halogenated.
    According to the company, the blend is currently used to
replace CFC 12 as a propellant in aerosol containers, and has
been successfully tested as a refrigerant.
   
    Pennwalt manufactures chemicals, pharmaceuticals and
precision equipment.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congress's long-awaited agreement
last Friday on an urgent bill to fund government operations is
expected to clear the way for the Agriculture Department to
unlock its coffers, closed since May 1.
    House and Senate negotiators, breaking an extended logjam
over fiscal 1987 funding, agreed to appropriate 5.6 billion
dlrs to the Commodity Credit Corp.
    The bill, which is expected to be approved by both Houses
this week and signed into law soon by the president, would
cover all farm program costs through September 30 and provide a
1.0 billion dlrs cushion, congressional sources said.
    Elevator operators, transportation companies and dairy
processors have been especially hard hit by the freeze on CCC
payments, now entering its ninth week, USDA sources said.

<TITLE>BRITISH AIRWAYS SEES FIRST QUARTER RECOVERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Airways Plc's &lt;BAB.L> May
passenger and cargo traffic figures provided evidence of
recovery from last year's setbacks and this trend will be
reflected in first quarter results due in August, chairman Lord
King told the annual meeting.
    Earlier this month, the newly-privatised airline reported a
29 pct rise in passenger traffic figures for May, with cargo
traffic up 22 pct.
    In the year to March, British Airways reported a drop in
pre-tax profits to 162 mln stg from 195 mln previously.
However, King said this result was satisfactory, considering
the difficulties posed by the Chernobyl disaster and the U.S.
Raid on Libya.
    He said British Airways intended to return its tour travel
operations to profitability, when questioned by shareholders.
    In 1986/87, this division reported an operating loss of
nine mln stg, the fifth year of losses. However, he said the
group might reconsider its course of action if a turnaround
seemed unlikely in the long-term.

<TITLE>JAPAN SETS CONDITION FOR CAR PLANT LOAN TO POLAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan said an international agreement on
loans to Poland was needed before Tokyo extended fresh loans to
Warsaw to help a Japanese car maker set up a factory there.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone explained the conditions
during the first round of talks with the visiting Polish leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski, foreign ministry sources said.
    They quoted Jaruzelski as saying of a private Japanese plan
to export car production facilities to Poland, "If this project
goes well, it will serve as an engine in future economic
relations between Poland and Japan."
    Nakasone, speaking of the possibility of resuming extending
official loans to Poland, said, "It is necessary that an
agreement should be established at an international arena such
as the Paris Club of creditor nations."
    He hoped that such an agreement will be achieved at an
early date, but he did not make firm commitments about Japanese
loans, the sources said.
    Along with western nations, Japan has witheld new official
credits to Poland since February 1982, following the 1981
declaration of martial law in Poland.
    The Japanese car maker Daihatsu Motor &lt;DMOT.T> and three
trading houses including Mitsui Co Ltd plan to export
production facilities to Poland's state-owned car maker FSO to
make the Charade minicar, according to Mitsui officials.
    "We are pushing the plan on the premise of an official
credit to be extended eventually," a Mitsui spokesman said.
    Nakasone also said that a joint Japan-Poland economic
committee would discuss the proposed conclusion of an
investment protection agreement later this year, the sources
said.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK CHIEF STRESSES THIRD WORLD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank is prepared to play a
more aggressive role in promoting Third World development, bank
president Barber Conable said in a magazine interview.
    "Our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as
greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of
private investment in Third World countries through our
affiliate, the International Financial Corporation," Conable
told Newsweek International.
    Conable, who has just completed his first year as head of
the World Bank, said the bank's mission remains the development
of Third World nations.
    "The bank is primarily a development institution, not a
debt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively or
it hampers development," he told Newsweek.
    Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt
crisis, which has prompted a number of U.S. commercial banks to
write off a portion of their Third World loans.
    Conable defended his own reorganization plan for the World
Bank, which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and
limiting a growing bureaucracy.
    And he said environmental considerations will play a larger
role in the evaluation of proposed projects.

    Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it
regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT
and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an
increasing share of the U.S. pasta market.
    The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on
pasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the
question of how much the subsidy should be cut.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAID OPEN TO DEAL ON 1988 U.S. TAX RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BEAVER CREEK, Colo., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan is willing
to compromise with Democrats in Congress on a plan to raise new
federal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform the
budget process, White House Budget Chief James Miller said.
    "If the Democrats want to insist that the president say
whatever is agreed to is a tax increase, then they'd better
just forget it because he's not going to do that," Miller said
in an interview with Reuters.
    "But there are a lot of revenues other than those the
president proposed (in his January budget plan), I think, that
we might look seriously at," he added.
    The Reagan budget, which has been widely criticized by both
Democrats and Republicans in Congress, envisages raising 22
billion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package of
government assets and new fees on certain federal services.
    President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any tax
increase voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year, arguing
that cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce the
huge federal deficit.
    The deficit, which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year, is
expected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year and
would fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budget
blueprint recently approved by Congress.
    The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan contains
about 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes in
the government's budgetary year beginning October 1.
    The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to be
raised, leaving it to the House Ways and Means and Senate
Finance committees to fill in the details later this year.
    Miller appeared to be signaling that the president might
consider some sort of tax increase despite his frequently
stated rejection of the concept.
    However, Miller declined to say which new revenue sources
might be acceptable to the president.
    "I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set out
options) which might suggest that we have one thing or another
in mind," the White House budget chief said.
    He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions of
certain moves, such as raising excise taxes on beer, cigarettes
or telephone service, or raising corporate or personal income
tax rates.
    "I think that those in Congress who think it will be a
simple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxes
are underestimating what they would be getting themselves into,"
he said. "What they don't really realize is that the political
opposition they are going to feel to excise taxes is going to
be a lot hotter tahn the political opposition to user fees, in
certain ways, or asset sales," he continued.
    "But there are a lot of other things and revenue issues in
government that probably ought to be addressed," he said.
    Before agreeing to a revenue package, the president would
insist on reform of the budget process, Miller said.
    "The president is not going to take a sucker punch. He's not
going to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we
can't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact
will be delivered," he emphasized.
    "We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a
contract, so that if the president agrees to something, he can
depend on its coming through."
    After returning to the United States from the economic
summit in Venice earlier this month, President Reagan revived
an earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform, calling for
a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the
power -- called a "line-item veto" -- to block individual items
in congressional spending bills.
    At the Venice summit, U.S. trading partners called on
Washington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global
trade imbalances.
   
    Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S.

<TITLE>BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT DROPS BUDGET TAX PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bangladesh government dropped from its
proposed budget some tax increases that had provoked opposition
parties to call a national strike for tomorrow.
    Prime Minister Mizanur Rahman Choudhury told Parliament
last night the taxes were dropped to help farmers and the poor,
but opposition groups said the strike was still on.
    Choudhury also said the price of soybean oil and the excise
duty on some fabrics would be lowered.
    He said a proposed additional two pct land development tax
from the budget, which is for fiscal 1987/88 starting July 1,
had been dropped. Choudhury said the tax withdrawal would cause
a revenue shortfall of 130 mln taka.
    His announcement came shortly after the 21 opposition
parties called a six-hour nationwide strike for tomorrow.
    Opposition parties had said the taxes would affect the poor
and middle class and leave the wealthy untouched, and the
secretary-general of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, K.M. Obaidur Rahman, said the government's action would
not avert tomorrow's strike.

<TITLE>INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
export earnings for export promotion abroad.
    The move is designed by the government to improve India's
trade deficit.
    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
    The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
of annual export earnings.
    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

Helicopter Textron Inc said it and two United Auto Workers
union locals agreed to a new three-year contract, ending a

    A company spokesman said the strike was based on a
disagreement over the method of future pay rises.
    The spokesman said the company's original offer was based
on lump sum payments over three years at six pct in the first
year, four pct in the second year and three pct in the third.
    He said management and the unions later agreed to a system
that combined general pay increases with lump sum payments over
the life of the contract.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co said it was advised by the
Securities and Exchange Commission that that commission will
file an amicus curiae brief in the Texas Supreme Court
concerning the Pennzoil/Texaco Inc (TX) litigation, but said it
was not aware whether that brief will adopt the position of one
of the litigants.
    Pennzoil said the brief is expected to be filed about July
20. "We do not know whether the brief will adopt the position
of one of the litigants or simply be an inquiry and request for
clarification of the reasoning of the two previous decisions in
this matter, both of which have been favorable to Pennzoil, a
Pennzol spokesman said.
    Pennzoil said that regardless of the focus of the brief
"Pennzoil will make an appropritate response in the court in
due course."
    Earlier today, Texaco said that in a letter dated June 26,
the SEC's general counsel told attornys representing Texaco and
Pennzoil that the commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court
to review the issue of federal securities law in the case
between the two companies. The litigation stems from Texaco's
purchase of Getty Oil Co in 1984 after Pennzoil had made an
offer from Getty.

<TITLE>DATACARD &lt;DATC.O> ADOPTS DIVIDEND RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>DataCard Corp said it adopted a
dividend rights plan in response to Deluxe Check Printers Inc
&lt;DLX> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in DataCard to
National Computer Systems Inc &lt;NLCS.O>.
    DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or
other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
DataCard said.
   
    National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
stake of its stock to National Computer.
    In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it "is not
designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
stockholders."
    The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
   
    Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
the rights.
    The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to
shareholders of record July 9.

<TITLE>ENTERTAINMENT &lt;EM> MAY SEEK CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY></TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its
president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc
shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
shareholders "regarding the affairs" of the company.
    Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
    Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
would be provided with "certain information" about Crazy Eddie,
it told the SEC.
    Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
    Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
    Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
investment banker.
    In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
their investment" in Crazy Eddie stock.
    Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
market, through private purchases or in connection with a
merger or tender offer.
    According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie
common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93
dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. moves to increase its warships in
and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
    "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
Gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.
    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by
American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
by diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the
Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.
    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."
    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
    "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving
world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
last Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event
of any U.S. strike against Iran.
    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

<DATELINE>    MIAMI, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Video Jukebox Network Inc said it has
extended through July two the exclusive period provided in its
May 29 letter of intent the option to sell to a group of
investors 3,500,000 shares of the four mln shares of the
company's common stock owned by its founder and president
Steven A. Peters.
    Video said it currently has 7,525,000 common shares

    The purchasers are Louis Wolfson III, vice president of
&lt;Venture W Inc>, an investment firm; Mark Blank, president of

chief executive officer of &lt;Communications Equity Associates
Inc>; and CEA Investors Partnerships II, a company Michaels
would form for the purchase, Video said.
    Video said it agreed to extend the period at the request of
the prospective buyers in order to provide their respective
counsels sufficient time to finalize the draft agreement which
the parties have negotiated.
   
    The company previously said that the outright purchase was
valued at three mln dlrs, or an option purchase price of
250,000 dlrs excersizable until May 28, 1988.
    The exercise price would be 3,750,000 dlrs plus the initial

grant an additional six month option to the buyers enabling
them to purchase two mln shares for 1,750,000 dlrs plus the
initial option purchase price of 250,000 dlrs.

<TITLE>GABELLI FIRMS HOLD 28.5 DIGIORGIO &lt;DIG> STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of firms led by Gabelli Group
Inc told government regulators it holds a 28.5 pct stake in
Digiorgio Corp common stock, and said two partnerships making
up part of the group may seek control of the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Comission, the
group of firms said it holds 2,430,100 shares of Digiorgio
common stock. Of the total, 2,059,400 shares are held by GAMCO
Investors Inc and Gabelli Funds Inc. for investment purposes,
the group said.

    Gabelli-Rosenthal and Partners LP and G and R Partners,
which hold the remaining 370,700 Digiorgio common shares, told
the SEC their "purpose is to ultimately obtain control of
Digiorgio contingent upon approval of Digiorgio," according to
the SEC filing. 
    As previously reported, Gabelli and Co Inc, acting as
investment advisor to a group including Gabelli-Rosenthal,
proposed on June 25 to acquire all Digiorgio common shares for
a per share price of 20 dlrs in cash, a subordinated note with
a face value of eight dlrs, 14 pct redeemable preferred stock,
and one common share of the post-buyout company.
    The June 25 buyout proposal, which remains open until July
17, also provides that key members of Digiorgio management and
some of its directors would be invited to remain with the firm
and participate in the group acquiring the company.
    The proposal is also subject to a due diligence review,
execution of a merger agreement, arrangement of financing and
receipt of government approvals, all of which Gabelli and Co
said could be completed within 60 days.
    Between April 13 and June 26, the entire group led by
Gabelli Group Inc made net purchases of 403,600 Digiorgio
common shares at 22.20 dlrs to 26.79 dlrs a share.

<TITLE>BRAZIL MOTOR INDUSTRY SENDS 9,000 ON LEAVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's motor industry, facing the
worst crisis of its history, today sent thousands of workers on
collective leave because of a sharp drop in demand.
    Company spokesmen said Autolatina, which last Friday laid
off 4,000 workers, sent nearly 9,000 of its 56,500 employees in
Brazil on collective leave until July 12.
    General Motors do Brasil said it would give 10 days' leave
to part of its 22,000 workforce from Wednesday.
    Fiat is giving 2,000 workers a month's holiday from July 6.
    Jacy Mendonca, industrial relations director of Autolatina,
a merger of Volkswagen and Ford in Brazil and Argentina, said
last week this would be the worst year ever for Brazil's auto
industry.
    He forecast that 1987 would be worse than 1981, when
domestic sales dropped 40 pct to 580,000 units.
    "This year we'll be lucky if we can sell 550,000 units," he
said.
    Since Friday there have been two positive developments for
the industry. The government announced that it was scrapping a
15 pct surcharge on all new car sales.
    The surcharge, created in July last year, was originally
set at 30 pct to help curb a car-buying boom and was in theory
refundable.
    Brazilian car distributors, which since June 16 had halted
all car purchases in protest against high government taxes,
responded to the government move by resuming purchases.
    But industry spokesmen said taxes on vehicles were still
high, 108 pct, and the sector still faced major problems.

<TITLE>WESTERN DONORS STILL BACKING ZAMBIA, SAYS MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Gibson Chigaga said all
of Zambia's traditional financial backers apart from Britain
had pledged continued backing for the country's new go-it-alone
economic program announced last month.
    Chigaga told Reuters in an interview it was not true that
Western states had threatened to withold financial aid
following Zambia's abandonement of a tough IMF-inspired program
that included the auctioning of the local kwacha.
    "It is only Britain which has openly come out to say it
would withhold funds intended for the auction system of foreign
exchange," Chigaga said.
    "All the other countries have said their relationship with
us cannot be affected by the abandonment of a system that only
lived for 18 months, when they have been supporting us for over
20 years now," he said.
    Chigaga said that Britain was now considering its stand
following representation by the Zambian government.
    Chigaga told Reuters that guidelines on the functioning of
the new economic prgram would be released soon.

<TITLE>STRIKES HIT CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST &lt;cb.to> MILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consolidated-Bathurst Inc said three of
its Quebec newsprint mills have been shut down by strikes which
began over the weekend.
    The company said about 2,000 workers, members of the
Canadian Paperworkers Union and another, independent union,
walked out at its Wayagamack mill at Trois-Rivieres, its
Laurentide mill at Grand-Mere and its Belgo mill at Shawinigan.
    Their contract expired April 30.
    The Laurentide mill has an annual capacity of 200,000 
tonnes, the Belgo mill 350,000 tonnes, and the Wayagamack mill
70,000 tonnes.
    The strikes are the first at Consolidated-Bathurst mills
since an industry-wide walkout in 1976, company spokeswoman
Denise Dallaire said.
    "As far as management is concerned, negotiations are going
on right now," Dallaire said, adding she could not elaborate.
Union officials were not immediately available for comment.
Company officials had said at the annual meeting in April they
expected no labor problems this year.

<TITLE>RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
Inc.
    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
days," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
above normal moisture this week."
    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
pretty good rain," Mohler said.
    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
in early July, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING IN 3RD QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. car production is scheduled to drop
by 10.4 pct to about 1.47 mln in the third quarter from last
year's 1.63 mln as domestic automakers react to a drop in sales
from last year's record levels, trade paper Automotive News
said.
    Automotive News said General Motors Corp &lt;GM> has slashed
its planned car production by 12.6 pct from last year's third
quarter totals while Ford Motor Co &lt;F> is scheduling its plants
to build 5.4 pct fewer cars and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> will be off
18.4 pct.
    But the paper quoted analysts as saying the production
should be cut by at least 200,000 more units to avoid excessive
inventory build-up in view of a relatively soft market for new
cars.
    Through June 20, sales of new domestic-built cars are off
11.9 pct from last year's levels. Only Ford among the Detroit
Big Three is enjoying a sales gain.
    GM and Ford may be working to stockpile cars despite the
market conditions because of the prospect of a strike in
September by the United Automobile Workers union, analysts said.

<TITLE>APOLLO &lt;APCI.O> CUTS WORKSTATION PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Apollo Computer Inc said the price cuts
announced earlier today on its Domain Series 3000 computer
workstations average 35 pct to 50 pct.
    An Apollo spokesman said the cuts bring prices to under
5,000 dlrs for some Series 3000 models.
    In addition to reducing prices, the company said it added
new monochrome and color models to the Series 3000 line that
improve its performance and graphics capabilities.
    The company made the price cuts along with the introduction
of a more powerful family of workstations, the Domain Series
4000.
   
    Industry analysts had expected Apollo to reprice the Series
3000 in response to aggressive price cuts made two weeks ago by
Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> on its competing
workstations.
    But the Apollo spokesman said the reductions had been
planned for some time. "We haven't just cut prices," he added,
noting that the company had improved the Series 3000 models.
    Analysts have said they also expect Sun Microsystems Inc
&lt;SUNW.O>, Apollo's biggest rival in the workstation market, to
cut prices and introduce new models. Sun has scheduled a new
conference on July eight.

<TITLE>FED ALLOWS CITICORP &lt;CCI>, SEARS &lt;S> THRIFT DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board said it
approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its
subsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets
and assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,
Calif.
    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in
deposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs
in assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.
    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and
liabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co
&lt;S>.
    The Fed said that it generally has determined there were
potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
    It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the
permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S
and L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."
    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity
Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs
and operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.
    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches
predominantly in southern California.
    The application, which was approved unanimously, will not
eliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said.

<TITLE>MEXICO GETS 205 MLN DLRS IN WORLD BANK LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved two
loans to Mexico totalling 205 mln dlrs to provide financial
assistance to industrial companies and finance a project
dealing with agricultural extension services.
    Mexico's Nacional Financiera (NF), the recipient of both
loans, will receive 185 mln dlrs to be used to provide
long-term credit and equity funds to small and medium-sized
industrial enterprises, the bank said.
    It said a 20 mln dlr loan is being made to help finance a
project designed to test strategies to improve the quality and
cost effectiveness of agricultural extension services.
    The industrial enterprise project, estimated to cost 350.3
mln dlrs, aims to support companies threatened by high
inflation and adversely affected by increased competition
brought about by bank-supported trade liberalization measures.
    The bank said the 73.8 mln dlr extension services project
will examine strategies in 20 of Mexico's 192 rural development
districts and finance training for personnel and farmers,
office construction and the purchasing of equipment.
    Both loans are for 15 years, including three years of
grace, with a variable interest rate, currently 7.92 per cent,
which is linked to the bank's cost of borrowing funds.

<TITLE>GROUP MAY SUPPORT CARDIS CORP &lt;CDS> BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of companies controlled by
Brookehill Partners Inc told government authorities it may
support a buyout of Cardis Corp as a way to maximize the value
of the company's stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
Cardis common stock, and said it "would likely support" an
acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
party, terming such a move "the most likely means for the
company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
investment."
    Although the group characterized its Cardis stock holdings
as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
Cardis, a Los Angeles-based auto parts distributor.
    The group added its has already had "some contacts" with
others concerning the company, but said no understandings have
been reached.
    "The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity
for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset
value and earnings momentum," the Brookehill group told the
SEC.
    The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common
shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its
two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and
Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter
Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York,
each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners.
    Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net
purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs
a share. The group told the SEC it may continue to purchase
additional Cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell
its shares in the company.

<TITLE>BANK OF NEW YORK &lt;BK> SEES 2ND QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of New York Co Inc said it expects
a second quarter loss of 35 mln dlrs.
    The company said this is partly due to an addition of 135
mln dlrs to its loan loss allowance.
    The 135 mln dlr addition to its loan loss allowance, which
is expected to be 400 mln dlrs on June 30, is in recognition of
recent international debt developments.
    It said its loss projection of 35 mln dlrs for the second
quarter, ending June 30, takes into account the 49 mln dlr gain
from the sale of RMJ Holdings and compares with last year's
second quarter income of 37.8 mln dlrs.
    The first six months should show income of around 12 mln
dlrs, the bank said, with income set to exceed 100 mln dlrs for
the full year.
    Last year's income reached 155 mln dlrs.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 1.3 billion dlrs of debt of Public Service
Company of New Hampshire.
    Under review are B-1 first mortgage bonds, B-2 refunding
mortgage bonds, B-3 third mortgage and secured pollution
control revenue bonds, Caa debentures and preferred stock.
    Moody's cited an uncertain ability to meet fixed-income
obligations due to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's refusal
to grant a low-power operating license because of inadequate
evacuation plans. The firm depends on credit markets to fund
obligations, due to a negative internal cash flow, it said.

    House and Senate Democrats, who control Congress, have been
critical of Reagan's plan but have not decided how or if they
should try to pass legislation to prohibit it.
    Wright, a Texas Democrat, told reporters the Administration
had gone ahead with plans to reflag the Kuwaiti tankers as U.S.
ships without asking Congressional leaders for their advice.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
takeover offer.
    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
    Securities law requires takeover target companies to
promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
said.
    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
tender offer.
    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

<TITLE>U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury Department said it
notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
Aruba.
    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
said in a two-sentence announcement.
    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
said.
    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
spokesman said.
    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
spokesman said.
    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
at lower interest rates.
    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
with lower yields.

over operations of several facilities at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash, the
DOE said.
    It said that Westinghouse replaces Rockwell International
and UNC Nuclear Inc, who have been criticized by the state of
Washington, the federal government and environmentalists for
failing to correct safety problems at Hanford.
    Westinghouse signed a four billion dlr contract three weeks
ago to operate Hanford for the next five years, DOE said.
    The contract provides the company and annual profit between
1.4 mln and 14.6 mln dlrs, depending on the quality of its
performance, the DOE said. "Our first objective is to be safe,"
soid William Jacobi, Westinghouse general manager at Hanford,
adding, "If we can make that (safety) a priority we can have
the production we need."
    Westinghouse's chief mission at Hanford is to produce
plutonium, supervise research for the Strategic Defense
Inititive, SDI, and the cleanup of military nuclear waste
stored in tanks at the site since the 1940's, company and DOE
officials said.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council
of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the
current backwardation in world copper market prices but does
not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources
here said.
    The organisation's executive and marketing committees
reviewed the current market situation during a series of
meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.
    The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of
nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks
and is the longest on record.
   "It's unusual," one official said, but added CIPEC did not
have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.
    The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of
CIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres,
which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.
    Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual
ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in
late September.
    The last three ministerial meetings have been held in Paris
to keep down costs.

<TITLE>ANGLO AMERICAN ATTACKS KEY APARTHEID LAW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anglo American Corp of South Africa
Ltd. &lt;ANGL.J> has attacked a key apartheid law barring blacks
from living in white residential areas as "racially
discriminatory" and "economically wasteful."
    The Group Areas Act, was also a "misuse of resources the
South African economy can no longer sustain," the directors said
in the annual report released today.
    These latest remarks by South Africa's biggest company,
follows past criticisms by the firm that apartheid was
economically inefficient.

    The company said the country's prospects for economic
growth had improved in the past few months after two years of
deep recession, but cautioned that the economic outlook was
heavily dependent on a solution to South Africa's political
turmoil.
    The directors said the resumption of sustained economic
growth was dependent on stable domestic conditions and the
restoration of normal international relationships.
    The South African government this year is targeting three
pct real growth in gross domestic product against an increase
of less than one pct last year.

    "A moderate rate of growth in the year ahead should not give
rise to strains on the balance payments, provided there is not
a substantial deterioration in export earnings or an
acceleration of capital outflows," Anglo American said.
    Anglo American last month reported a 25.8 pct advance in
net attributable profit to 1.5 billion rand in the year to
March 31.

<DATELINE>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nec Electronics Inc said
the U.S. Ninth District Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to
hear the company's petition seeking the disqualification of the
judge presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp &lt;INTC.O>.
    In granting the hearing the court directed Intel to respond
to the NEC petition by July 16, NEC said.
    The petition stems from a suit filed by NEC against Intel
in 1984.
    In its complaint NEC is seeking a judgement stating that
microcode is not copyrightable subject matter and that the
microcode NEC uses in its V-Series microprocessors does not
infringe on any valid Intel corprights.
    During May last year the judge presiding over the case,
William Ingram, submitted a financial disclosure report to the
U.S. Judicial Conference which showed that he owned Intel stock
through an investment club throughout the proceedings, NEC
said.

<TITLE>HOSPITAL GROUP IS AGAINST MANDATORY AIDS TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Hospital Association said
the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS to hospital workers
is for workers to wear protective clothing rather than through
routine tests of all hospital patients for the disease.
    The non-profit advocacy organization, which represents
hospitals and patients, recommended that hospital workers
should wear protective gear whenever there is a chance they
will be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, regardless of
whether the fluids are known to be infected with AIDS.
    The group also said that "reliance on negative AIDS test
results to determine when to take specific precautions can lead
to a false sense of security among health care workers."
    So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workers
contracting AIDS from hospital patients. Despite the low risk
of contracting, the group said, "Hospital workers are
understandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS)."
    There are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals with
nurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact with
blood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.
    Among the Americal Hospital Association's recommendations
were that health care workers exposed to body fluids must wear
gloves, and in some cases, gowns, masks, and eye coverings.

<TITLE>DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEDELLIN, Colombia, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consumer countries should not
intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
    "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the
recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers
want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
    The main consumer country the United States and main
producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in
February.
    Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in
September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
hands of producer countries.
    "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year
we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
are not in a position to do favours."

<TITLE>NBC SAYS PROGRAMMING NOT AFFECTED BY STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Broadcasting Co, a unit of
General Electric Co &lt;GE>, said programming has not been
affected by a strike which began just after midnight June 28.
    "Right now things are running very smoothly," said NBC
spokeswoman McClaine Ramsey.
    The strike by members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees, representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000 workers,
began after the network imposed a contract which the union said
was unacceptable. The union said its main objection to the
contract was that it permitted NBC to employ additional
part-time workers.
    Ramsey said managers had been trained to replace the roles
of many of the producers, news writers, editors and technicians
who walked off the job. She said no reductions in programming,
much of which is summer re-run schedule, were expected.
    NABET executive board member Bill Freeh said many people,
some brought in from foreign news bureaus, had crossed picket
lines set up at NBC television stations and bureaus.

<TITLE>CANADA SETS OFF ITS OWN BIG BANG</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Cooney, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 29 - Echoes of London's Big Bang -- </DATELINE><BODY>stock
market deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadian
securities industry sets off its own fireworks.
    Some companies are quickly taking advantage of
deregulation, but more significant moves are likely to be a
year or more down the road, analysts say.
    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond
trading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which they
have experience under the old rules that allowed them to
provide government debt financing and advisory services.
    "When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,"
said Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. "Then they will eventually
just start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' price
comes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too."
    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage
houses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'
businesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open
competition.
    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed "Little Bang," will
allow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions
to set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.
    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own
securities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a
Canadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100
pct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently
own no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.
    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by
June 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by
foreign and domestic financial giants.
    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a
swirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation
fever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to
four times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,
analysts said.
    "I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower
their asking prices," said financial services analyst Jeff
Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated
talks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.
    "I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch
away from Burns Fry," added Carney. "It is just a lot of money.
When your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult
to pay that amount of cash."
    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was
uncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were
issued and approved only in mid-June.
    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have
focused their deregulation strategy on planning their own
Canadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, Canada's largest equities market.
    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.
Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.
recently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United
States investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs
and Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.
    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms
include agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
to raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10
pct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a
minority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.
    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign
acquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become
familiar with Canada.
    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to
compete in the increasingly global securities market, industry
officials said.
    "That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change
will throw off one or two Canadian global firms," Toronto Stock
Exchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.
    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed
cautiously into the securities field.
    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the
banks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will also
find it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culture
with that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,
they said.
    While the banks have been approached by securities firms
seeking merger partners, they have not yet bought into
brokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.
    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest
bank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.
after several months of negotiations.
    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally
acquires an existing firm, "all the other banks will jump in.
    "They don't want to be perceived as missing out on
something," said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analyst
Albert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensive
a risk for banks.

<TITLE>SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corporate mergers and acquisitions
in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government."
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

downgraded American Healthcare Management Inc's subordinated
notes to D from B, affecting 80 mln dlrs of securities.
    S and P said that this for-profit operator of 34 actue-care
hospitals missed its semi-annual interest payment on the debt.
    The rating agency said the failure to renegotiate terms on
bank obligations was the key to this default. That is because
payments on the notes are prohibited until default under terms
of senior obligations is remedied.

<TITLE>CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron
Corp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
barrels, industry analysts said.
    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
crude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inch
surface choke.
    "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
and Co told Reuters.
    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
pct.
    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
    "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
up," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
showed that it flows well.
    "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
recovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
disclose any reserve figures.
    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
heavy crude it produced.
    "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
lot narrower today," Osborne said.
    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which
include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons
(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd
and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.

announced to cover the next three years.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import
of cotton yarn.
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and
rice along with the state corporations.
    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make
high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and
to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This
would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess
of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this
year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news
conference.
    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to
320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.
    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
produce during the past few months," he said.
    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean
production from March to May this year.
    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC
members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
    "They understood our position and we believe we remain
within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.
    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
    While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
mln barrels of products, Santos said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it has extended
loans totalling 241 mln dlrs to Niger and Zaire to help support
economic reforms through structural adjustment programs.
    The loans have been made through the International
Development Association (IDA), the bank's concessionary lending
arm, and the African Facility, a three-year IDA-administered
fund that supports economic policy reforms in sub-Saharan
Africa, the bank said.
    Zaire's structural adjustment program, supported by a 67
mln dlr IDA loan and a 94 mln dlr African Facility loan, hopes
to lay the basis for sustained economic growth, the bank said.
    Included in the program's goals are strengthening private
sector incentives, aiding macroeconomic management, and
unspecified changes in transportion and agricultural policies,
the bank said.
    Niger's structural adjustment program, supported by a 60
mln dlr IDA loan and a 20 mln dlr African Facility loan, hopes
to aid public spending controls, support pricing reforms, and
encourage private sector competition, the bank said.

<TITLE>U.S. LEADS JAPAN IN FINANCIAL FUTURES BUSINESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Hisanobu Ohse, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. firms are expected to enjoy the
advantage of superior experience over their Japanese
competitors in the new, promising business of bringing asset
rich Japanese investors to the U.S. financial futures markets.
    Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to
start using overseas futures in currencies, bonds and stocks to
help them manage their bulging foreign portfolios.
    "U.S. investment banks are going to take advantage. We've
been in the business for two decades, the Japanese have not,"
said Eugene Atkinson, president of Goldman, Sachs Japan Corp.
   
    Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the
new markets, but in fact participation so far has been slow,
Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said.
    Koichi Kane, Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities
International, said, "They're still in a starting up period."
    "They're testing the water," Atkinson added. But once they
start, the Japanese are likely to become very big players,
opening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.
    U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start is
understandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, are
fairly new to the market.
   
    Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., but
because of the high risks involved American pension funds and
mutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until
relatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analyst
said.
    In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures,
an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed
for the slow start, the Japanese sources said.
   
    Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domestic
financial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers
in Japan for overseas futures markets.
    This may change next year, when bankers speculate that
securities houses will be permitted to enter this line of
business.
    While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americans
have moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc,
Goldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and
PainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.
   
    In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc is
preparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of
Trade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for
futures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.
    Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yet
decided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the
U.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors and
the U.S. futures markets, Kane said.
    The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently to
coincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increased
Japanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issue
is still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.
   
    High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures
market, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime
trading session in Chicago if possible, they said.
    The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and
establishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizing
clerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and
Chicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.
    Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from the
securities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into the
U.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.
    
    One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions,
which was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into the
brokerage business, they said.
    "The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or
to go into a business tie-up," said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda
Trust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.
    One trust bank source said total fees could amount to
around one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets
fully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.
    Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively
many foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth
capital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be a
different story, Japanese banking sources said.
    They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to
difficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.
    In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S.
brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13
dlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.
    Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to
approach Japanese financial institutions about possible
tie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.
    But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small
capital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese
nervous about a capital link.
    Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage
business once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts
growing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.
    But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanese
government would let banks engage in this new risky business.

<TITLE>ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> LISTS MAIN CREDITORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Court documents filed with the U.S.
bankruptcy court by attorneys for Allis-Chalmers Corp &lt;AH>
listed Equitable Life Assurance Co as one of the largest
creditors.
    According to the court papers, Equitable was owed a total
of 468,859 dlrs. Other creditors included Connecticut General
Life Insurance Co, owed 192,520 dlrs, and New York Life
Insurance Co, owed 146,553 dlrs.
    The list of unsecured creditors was headed by KHIC America
Corp, of Rutheford, New Jersey, which was owed 663,950 dlrs.
   
    Second on the list of unsecured creditors was a group of
paving contractors owed 600,000 dlrs.
    Manville Corp &lt;MAN> was third with 471,157 dlrs owed.
    Allis-Chalmers said that on Dec 31 the unfunded pension
liabilities totaled 44 mln dlrs.
    It said that it intended to carry out a reorganization by
disposing of businesses that do not contribute adequately to
cash flow. The company said it plans to eliminate unprofitable
product lines and emphasize more profitable product lines.
    Allis-Chalmers said it intended to obtain workforce
reductions and seek monetary and other concessions from
salaried and hourly employees.
    It said it will eliminate operations of facilities that are
marginal performers. The company said it plans to discontinue
burdensome contracts and leases as well as collective
bargaining agreements.
    The company said it believes creditors will realize more
from a reorganization than from a liquidation.
    The documents said Allis-Chalmers has suffered substantial
losses since 1981 due to sales declines caused by fierce
competition and a sluggish global economy.
    It said a restructuring plan, which it has already 
instituted, adversely affected cash flow because certain costs
including product liability and retiree medical and pension
costs continued as before despite a reduction in the size of
its business.

<TITLE>EPA TO REJECT CLEAN-AIR PLANS FOR 14 AREAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) announced plans to disapprove clean-air plans for 14
metropolitan areas and called for bans in those areas on new
construction of potentially polluting facilties.
    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said in a statement the areas
had not shown they could meet agency ozone or carbon-monoxide
air-quality standards by the end of 1987 or soon after.
    He said the proposed ban on construction would cover such
industries as electric utilities, iron and steel production
plants, industrial boilers and petroleum refineries.
    The areas affected are Chicago; the Indiana portion of the
Chicago area; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Indiana portion of the
Louisville, Ky., area; Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Ga.;
Dallas-Ft. Worth, Tex.; Denver, Colo.; the California south
coast, including Los Angeles; Fresno, Sacramenta, Ventura and
Kern counties, Calif., and Washoe County (Reno), Nev.
    Thomas also proposed major changes to existing sources of
pollution in those areas.  They would effective after a final
assessment of the area's pollution, expected late this year or
early next.
    For Cleveland, the EPA also proposed a restriction on
federal highway funding and clean-air grants because the state
of Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb car
pollutions as required by the Clean AirAct.
    Thomas said:
    "It is clear that the state implementation plans for these
areas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxide
standards under the deadline mandated by Congress. In these
circumstances the Clean Air Act leaves no discretion.  I must
propose sanctions."
    The EPA estimated that another 20 metropolitan areas will
fail to meet the agency's ozone standards by the end of the
year. About 70 are meeting the ozone standards.
    It added that about 80 areas are now not meeting the EPA
carbon-monoxide standards, but only a few will have long-term
problems in meeting the standards.
    The EPA has proposed that car-makers be ordered to install
canisters on new cars beginning in 1979 to capture polluting
gasoline vapors which escape when gas is pumped from filling
stations to a car's gas tank.

<TITLE>FRANCO-GERMAN PARLEY FAILS TO UNBLOCK FARM TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A specially convened Franco-German
meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to
make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has
deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said
    The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign
ministers from both countries and by French President Francois
Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
    The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to
providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the
Community's worst-ever budget crisis.
    "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chirac
told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly
angered as he the hour-long meeting.
    Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for
the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the
EC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translate
common EC farm prices into national currencies.
    Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which
West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the
Netherlands.
    EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the
package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline
tomorrow.
    Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have
injected fresh impetus into those talks.
    The Commission proposed its package to save one billion
dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.
    The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to
alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and
plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
measure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
strength of the petroleum industry."
     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
the measure would become effective.
   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
government debt bonds.                        
    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
government bonds.
  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
repurchasing the bonds.
    PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial
sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>CANADIAN TIRE &lt;CTC.TO> HOPES TO SOLVE DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Tire Corp Ltd said it still
hopes a special board committee can solve a voting rights
dispute between class A and common stock shareholders.
    "Although no such proposal has yet been developed, the
directors hope that such a result can be achieved," chairman
Hugh Macaulay said at the annual meeting.
    The committee, formed last fall, has been trying to
determine the voting rights of class A non-voting shares if
control of the company changes hands.
   
    The Ontario Securities Commission blocked a 270 mln dlr
takeover bid last January for 49 pct of the company's common
shares.
    The OSC said the bid by a group of Canadian Tire store
owners abused shareholders rights by circumventing share
provisions that would convert non-voting stock into voting
shares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership.
    Since then, three members of the Billes family, who agreed
to tender their 60 pct holding of Canadian Tire's common shares
to the pro rata offer, have commenced legal proceedings amongst
themselves.
    Macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation
"while matters remain in an unsettled state".
    At the meeting, president Dean Groussman said the higher
profit trend evident in the first quarter ended April 4 was
continuing. First quarter net rose 10 pct to 21.1 mln dlrs from
19.2 mln dlrs a year earlier.
    Groussman also said the company plans sharply higher
capital spending this year of 103 mln dlrs, compared to 43 mln
dlrs last year, and it will likely maintain high levels of
capital investment in 1988 and 1989.

<TITLE>INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of new single-family homes
tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
    "There should be another month or two of very weak new home
sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
should become more stable by mid-summer," said economist
Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
Department said.
    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
of the market, he and others said.
    "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
unexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist
with Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted to
hold back and see what would happen."
    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
sharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expected
a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," said
James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
homes.
    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."
    Others were less optimistic, however.
    "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
housing," said Chimerine of Wharton.
    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will be
maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."

<TITLE>BRAZIL LAND REFORM PROGRAM FALTERS, TENSIONS RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's land reform program, long
trumpeted by the government as one of its absolute priorities,
is mired in bureaucracy after achieving very few of its aims.
    Officials acknowledge that progress is now minimal. Land
rights activists see no progress at all and say things are
actually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures have
forced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.
    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debated
political issues, is particularly to the fore this year as a
Constituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.
    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does
not give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landless
families, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.
    "We make no secret of our tactics," said one leader of the
land reform movement, Joao Pedro. "The solution is to occupy --
that is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been a
single program of land reform in the world without the people
occupying land."
    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato
Grosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,
according to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linked
to the Roman Catholic Church.
    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after the
civilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimed
to resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up
the country's vast, undeveloped estates.
    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,
described the program as "one of its absolute priorities."
    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped so
far and the government admits that it will not get anywhere
near the original target.
    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was
now slower under Sarney than it had been under the military
government of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).
    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep
frustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in
Sao Paulo and other parts of the country.
    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, far
from improving, have significantly deteriorated.
    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,
said that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers had
been forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.
    He said the exodus had been caused first by the
government's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year froze
prices and hit the income of small farmers.
    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices and
interest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay
debts taken out during the price freeze.
    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left the
countryside in the south had previously been land-owners, while
a minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil's
swollen cities.
    One activist said the number of landless day labourers
called "boias-frias" (literally "cold meals"), most of whom cut
sugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state from
about 300,000 five years ago.
    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, the
land reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it
is sending to the Constituent Assembly.
    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum
permissible holding and the land rights movement does not
expect it to be voted into the constitution.
    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is
composed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly would
probably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection
would be the signal for large-scale land invasions.

<TITLE>U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States responded to an
apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    "I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself," State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome."
    Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

<TITLE>TEXACO (QTX) MAY BENEFIT FROM SEC BRIEF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and
Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion
dlr legal saga, some analysts said.
    Texaco today said the SEC would file a "friend of the
court" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the
case. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since
they said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the
rule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas
courts.
    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four
to 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the
SEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request
for a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been
previously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC
brief but it did not know whether the brief would support the
view of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for
clarification of the reasons for two lower state court
decisions.
    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme
Court to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.
    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a
tender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an
alleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.
    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those
making the offer from entering into contracts for the target
company's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes
SEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could
also have no affect. "If this friend of the court brief is
potent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the
Texas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment
could be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing," Leuffer said.
    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal
battle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court
awarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later
reduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now
totals 10.3 billion dlrs.
    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to
avoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security
bond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.
    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of
July 20.
    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other
analysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a
significant role. "The other argument is the court will ignore
it (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court
briefs," he said.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not
expect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.
"Everyday, you're going to see something like this," Cohen
said.
    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe
that the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it
believed the 10b-13 rule was involved. "I think what the market
sensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that
they may reach for the stars and fall on their face," Sales
said. "They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas," said Joel
Fischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other
analysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal
law that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or
refuses to hear its case.
    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to
the 10b-13 issue.
    Sales said the point was argued and the courts
"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the
legal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we
can correct that misimpression".
    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many
possible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that
Texaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded
by Pennzoil.
    "The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae
(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit
disturbed," said Cohen.
    "What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight
move down the road could have a multiplying effect," he said.

<TITLE>NEGOTIATIONS RESUME IN CANADIAN POSTAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-old
strike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violence
subsided after the federal government changed its mind and
appointed a mediator.
    The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Union
of Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first since
Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of a
mediator yesterday.
   
    There had been little progress between the parties last
week and both sides requested a mediator for the second time.
Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart to
warrant the help on an independent third party.
    Although the postal union said it would maintain its
strategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, only
the Montreal area was affected today and service was normal
elsewhere in Canada.
   
    Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use of
replacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator was
appointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.
    Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160
million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand in
the talks and the two sides remain far apart on wages and
working conditions.

<TITLE>FERC SEEKS STAY OF MIDDLE SOUTH &lt;MSU> RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW ORLEANS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Middle South Utilities Inc said the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has requested a 30-day
stay of a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling ordering the commission
to reconsider its allocation of costs from the Grand Gulf One
nuclear power plant.
    More than two years ago, FERC set the allocation af Grand
Gulf capacity and costs among the four Middle South operating
companies. These allocations, in turn, have become the basis
for contested rate filings the four operating utilities made to
regulators in their service areas.
    In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26, the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987
decision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria for
determining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocation
currently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under that
definition, Middle South said.
    The company said the ruling by the three-judge appeals
court panel "was totally unexpected, especially in light of the
timetable the full 11-member court set in April of this year
when it announced that all judges would rehear the panel's
January decision in which the panel had upheld FERC.
    In essence, Middle South said, "the three-member panel has
adopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, and
the full court has accepted the new decision."
    The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay. The
commission said it needed the time to determine the appropriate
course it should take in light of the new court decision.
    "Given its complexity and the need for clarification by the
FERC, the significance of this latest order will take time to
determine," Middle South said in a statement.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
    "I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
on product quality," Yaacobi said.
    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
currencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"
Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
toward higher U.S. exports.
    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
to achieve its economic potential.
    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
military conflicts "which were imposed on Israel," he said.
    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

<TITLE>CONTEL &lt;CTC> SEES LOWER 2ND QTR, YEAR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, Ga., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Contel Corp said its expects to
report second quarter earnings that are lower than last year's
74 cts a share and 1987 earnings from continuing operations
that are about 15 pct lower than last year's 3.04 dlrs per
share.
    Donald Weber, president and chief executive officer of
Contel, said that lower than expected revenues, higher than
anticipated costs to complete certain contracts and one-time
expenses are behind the lower earnings projections.
    As such, Weber said Contel has begun to evaluate
strategies, budgets and operating direction in each of the
company's divisions "with renewed emphasis on maximizing
shareholder value."
    Weber added that Contel is holding discussions with
&lt;Comsat> on an agreement to terminate the previosuly proposed
merger between the two companies.
    Weber added that the results of the evaluations of certain
parts of the company may be reflected later this year in a
combination of one-time gains or losses not in the anticipated
lower earnings.
    Webber said, however, that he was encouraged by the
continued strength of Contel's telephone businesses and the
strong showing from certain of the company's non-regulated
sectors.
    But, he added, that results for other parts of the company
will still be unsatisfactory.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> TO SELL GENERAL TIRE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of
Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an
agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc
subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
    Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
on or before November 30, 1984.
    The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
employees under the agreement.
    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and
Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
components businesses.
   
    Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
including general tire.
    "The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
reevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.
    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
the sale of General Tire "represents a critical accomplishment
in our plan to restructure GenCorp."
   
    Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
its other businesses are "proceeding satisfactorily."
    Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSING DEPT. BACKS PRIVATIZING FNMA &lt;FNM></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) said it backed an eventual severing of
the link between the government and the Federal National
Mortgage Association -- better known as Fannie Mae.
    But the department, in a long-awaited report requested by
Congress in 1984, shied from setting a timetable for the giant
housing finance institution to end its government ties.
   Instead, it said specific recommendations would come in a
second report, to be issued jointly by Fannie Mae and HUD by
Oct. 1.
   "The basic policy directive underlying FNMA's history has
been consistent -- a gradual movement toward fully private
status. There appears to be no need to change that policy," the
HUD report said.
    Any change in Fannie Mae's status would be up to Congress.
    The HUD report said the options open to Congress ranged
from doing nothing to full and immediate privatization.
    "Whatever option is selected, the combination of the
favorable economic environment, FNMA's recent move to financial
health, the current strength of the housing market and the
evolution of FNMA's role in the mortgage market from
contributor to competitor would all indicate that the time is
ripe for a positive move toward privatization," the report
concluded.
    Fannie Mae operated as a part of the federal government
from the time it was created in 1938 until 1968, when it was
rechartered by Congress and put under private ownership with
government backing.
    However, "it was always intended that FNMA would eventually
become fully private," the HUD report said.
    Fannie Mae's critics, including some Reagan administration
officials espousing a free-market philosophy, say government
sponsorship of the agency allows it to compete unfairly with
private lenders and investors.
    But its backers claim mortgage rates would be pushed up as
higher agency costs were eventually passed on to home buyers.
    Fannie Mae was created by Congress to make capital
available for housing by buying mortgages from lenders and
packaging them as securities to sell investors.

<TITLE>HOUSE RESOLUTION URGES TREATY TO PROTECT OZONE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Representatives passed a
resolution urging President Reagan to negotiate a world-wide
treaty to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons which are
depleting the earth's ozone layer.
    Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals used in aerosol sprays,
refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insultation, fire
extinguishers and cleaning solvents. They were banned in the
United States and Canada in 1978, but are still widely used in
Europe and Japan.
   
    The ozone layer of the atmosphere protects the earth
against ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.
    Scientists have warned that if chlorofluocarbons continue
to deplete the ozone layer, the additional ultraviolent
radiation striking the earth will cause a higher rate of skin
cancer.
    The non-binding resolution was passed by voice vote.

Canada by an average of between two and eight pct, in line with
a ruling by Canadian regulators.
    The company said it does not expect any change to net
revenues.
    The company said it will cut rates for calls within 
Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Northwest Territories by an
average of between two and three pct and by an average eight
pct for other parts of Canada, effective Wednesday.
   
    The changes will decrease the charges for longer distances
and increase shorter distance rates, Bell Canada said.
    The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission ordered Bell Canada to reduce its phone rates
because it said the company, which has a monopoly in certain
areas, was making more than the allowable rate of return.

<TITLE>SENATE REPUBLICANS BACK HINEMAN FOR CFTC POST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two leading Senate Republicans have
urged the White House to name Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Kalo Hineman to replace outgoing
Chairman Susan Phillips, congressional sources said.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen.
Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking minority member on the Senate
Agriculture Committee, both have endorsed Hineman for the top
CFTC post, the sources said.
    In addition, Lugar has urged White House Chief of Staff
Howard Baker to recommend Mark Sullivan, White House associate
personnel director, as CFTC commissioner, they said.
    Phillips's departure July 24 will create a vacancy on the
five-person commission and require the White House to appoint a
new chairman.
    Earlier this month, Sullivan emerged as a leading candidate
to replace Phillips, according to industry and congressional
sources.
    But Sullivan's lack of experience in commodity markets has
been cited as a liability by industry representatives.
    Hineman, a Kansas farmer, has drawn support from Dole and
other members of the congressional Agriculture Committees who
are eager to have farming interests well represented on CFTC.

<TITLE>A.H. ROBINS &lt;QRAH> TO CONSIDER RORER OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A.H. Robins Co said its board
has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group
Inc &lt;ROR> merits further consideration.
    At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend
until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.
Robins.
    After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last
Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds
control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
    But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
Shield related liabilities.
    After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
dlrs.
    Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
Dalkon Shield interuterine device.

<TITLE>PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistani government allowed freer
cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech the government had also decided to allow
duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
Pakistani products.
   
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s.
    But Haq said now the private sector would also export
cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
long-standing demand of the local traders.
    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
compete effectively in the world market, he said.
   
    Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
reviewed every year.
    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
longer period.
    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
countries on soft credit terms.
   
    Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
    He said the government policy was to rationalise and
streamline import controls.
    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
to smuggling and hampering of exports."
   
    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
from import restrictions.
    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

<DATELINE>     DALLAS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>First RepublicBank Corp said it will add
325 mln dlrs to its loan loss reserve for the second quarter.
     The company said the move, which is being made to cover
loans to developed countries, will result in a loss of around
313 mln dlrs in the second quarter ending June 30.
    First RepublicBank Corp said the increase in its loan loss
reserve will lead to a loss for the full year. Figures for last
year are unavailable as the bank was formed in June this year
after a merger of two Dallas-based banks, RepublicBank Corp and
InterFirst Corp.
    The company said the 325 mln dlrs provision will increase
its reserve to 1.1 billion dlrs, out of which it will allocate
275 mln dlrs to cover its loans to 18 developing countries.
    The company said it took the action in light of recent
action taken by other major banking organizations on developing
country loans.

<TITLE>LIMITED IMPACT SEEN FROM U.S. TAX ACCORD ACTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Barry, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. decision ending a forty-year
tax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely to
have a major impact on the Eurobond market, tax experts said.
    Most U.S. firms stopped using financial subsidiaries
incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to the
Eurobond market in July, 1984, the experts said.
    But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984
involving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and will
probably mean those bonds will be called before their maturity
date, they said.
    Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium,
calling them in early will mean a loss in market value for the
bondholders, according to a Treasury official who asked not to
be identified.
    The official said the Treasury Department was currently
unsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market.
    "We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports from
investors and issuers," the official said.
    Earlier, the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands of
the termination of the treaty effective January 1, 1988.
    For years, U.S. firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholding
tax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands
Antilles to sell Eurobonds, which are bonds issued abroad by an
overseas financial subsidiary.
    But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984
change in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interest
that allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market and
avoid the withholding tax.
    The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of U.S.
companies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds,
said Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co.
    Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreigners
investing in the U.S. through the Netherlands Antilles will
lose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios, Hannes
said.
    He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investors
who sought tax advantages because they reside in countries
which do not have a tax treaty with the United States.
    These investors typically reside in countries in the Middle
East, Central and South America, he said.
    Some of them may withdraw their U.S. investments or seek
tax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland, but
the choices are limited, Hannes said.
    "It is conceivable their investment may stay here. They
would bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the
past," Hannes said.
    U.S. domestic bonds are not affected by the change.
    U.S. companies with Eurobonds issued through the
Netherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid
the tax liability, a Treasury Department spokesman said. But
they could refinance at lower rates because of the general
decline in interest rates, so the Department does not expect
U.S. firms to be hurt by the decision, the spokesman said.
Negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands
continued without success since the late 1970's. The
differences centered on U.S. concern over residents of third
countries avoiding U.S. taxes by using the treaty with the
Netherlands Antilles.

<TITLE>CITICORP &lt;CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OAKLAND, Calif, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citicorp has extended its reach
into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,
bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
CitiCorp Savings said.
    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows
its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
    "This marks our first major expansion in California,
particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings President
Edward Valencia, in a statement.
    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
Sears was in that market.
    "We do believe they will be a better competitor than
Sears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.
    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
convert the branches to banks at that time.
    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson
and Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American
First Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund said
it approved a 48 mln dlr loan to assist Ecuador in meeting its
foreign exchange needs following the earthquakes that struck in
March.
    The loan, which the IMF provides countries under special
circumstances, is equal to 25 pct of Ecuador's quota, or
economic standing, in the Fund.
    The IMF said that according to recent estimates, the
earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this
year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of
part of the oil pipeline.

consenting to a distribution of certain assets of the company,
clearing the way for BCI's planned reorganization.
    Under the previously approved reorganization, BCI will be

acquired Beatrice Cos Inc in April 1986, will remain a
privately-held, primarily food company.
    Consent of the debt securities holders was necessary to
distribtute shares of E-II common stock plus 57.4 cts a share
to BCI shareholders and warrant holders, BCI said. Shares will
be distributed when a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective.
    Holders of 11 pct Ten Year Senior Notes who consented to
the amendments will receive 12.50 dlrs in cash for each 1,000
dlrs principal amount of debt securities. Consenting holders of
the other three issues of debt securities will receive 10 dlrs
in cash per 1,000 dlrs principal amount, BCI said. Total
principal amount outstanding is 2.5 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    STERLING, Va., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Star Technologies Inc said that a
settlement of a 1985 shareholder lawsuit has produced a 1.3 mln
dlr charge, which the company recorded in its fourth quarter
earnings.
    The company said it will pay the settlement with company
stock, subject to court approval.
    To reflect the settlement, therefore, the company said it
has revised its fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, earnings
by 1.3 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share on a primary basis.
    As such, the company said it is recording a net loss of
580,000 dlrs, or four cts a share, versus the net income of
740,000 dlrs previously reported.
    For the year to date ended March 31, net income was reduced
to 1.4 mln dlrs, from the 2.7 mln dlrs previously reported on
May 28.
    The class action suit, filed in a federal district court,
charged the company with various violations of federal
securities laws with regards to the company's initial public
offering in December, 1984 and certain subsequent filings.

    The company, forecasting a 15 pct drop in 1987 operating

all operations in an effort aimed at "maximizing long-term
stockholder value."
    Analysts also said Contel's federal systems division, which

    Contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of
selling any operations. However, the company indicated in a

<TITLE>SCOTT PAPER &lt;SPP> SEES IMPROVED EARNINGS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gary Seidman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Scott Paper Co, one of the leaders in
the tissue and coated paper business, said it expects 1987
earnings to be between 5.75 dlrs and 6.25 dlrs a share, within
the range proscribed by most Wall Street analysts.
    "We have put together five or six years of pretty
respectable growth and three consecutive years of record
earnings and I see no reason why this growth pattern should be
interrupted," Scott's chairman and chief executive officer
Philip Lippincott told Reuters in an interview.
    Last year, the company reported earnings of 4.96 dlrs a
share, reflecting the impact of a a strike at its Mobile,
Alabama, plant.
    Earlier today, Lippincott outlined his bullish growth
scenario for analysts, emphasizing that the company is dealing
with the growing capacity in the industry by developing new
products and modernizing plants. He said that capacity
increases in the industry, particularly tissue paper, have
stymied price hikes but Scott has boosted sales by providing
more distinctive products that meet the needs of consumers.
    "Scott Paper has shown tremendous growth in the last five
years, but I think that improvement is largely unappreciated by
the market," said analyst Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers who
noted that the stock is selling at a relatively low
price/earnings ratio.
    "They have been striving for a return on equity of 14 to 17
pct, but today they were talking about a much higher objective.
They are raising their financial objectives," Chao said.
    Sales of consumer products increased about four pct last
year and showed growth of about five pct pace in the first
quarter, eclipsing the overall industry wide sales pace of less
than two pct, Lippincott said.
    "The most favorable thing I came away with today is that
their Sommerset, Maine, plant which makes number four coated
paper, is sold out through September. That means their coated
paper business is looking particularly good," said Lawrence
Ross of PaineWebber Group Inc.
   
    Analyst George Adler of Smith Barney was equally
optimistic. "They don't have anything that is going to set the
world on fire right now but I am at a loss to find anything
negative either," Adler said.
    He said Scott Paper is continuing to gain market share by
emphasizing their strategy and developing distinctive products.
    Lippincott also noted that the company stands to gain from
the depressed level of the dollar. "The bottom line impact of a
lower dollar was about 15 cts a share in 1986, and we could
have a similar impact this year," he said.

<TITLE>U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects appear slim for a summer
meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
to last February. However, any delay this year should not
endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
    "It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
meeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz said.
    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
next talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.
   
    There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
    "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
or before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.
    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
year's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. It
would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."
    Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
logistics and production outlooks.

<TITLE>JUSTICE OPPOSES QUICK GREYHOUND-TRAILWAYS MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Justice Department said it asked
the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
    Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
plan.
    Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
    "Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
operations," Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
of interstate bus companies.
    But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
immediately.
    "The department has just begun to receive relevant
information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
process of assessing the correctness of the company's
allegations," acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
said in comments submitted to the ICC.
    Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
    Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
    The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
Trailways "could collapse in a matter of days."
    They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
    The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
bankruptcy "at any time."
    Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

<TITLE>SURVEY SEES U.S. MANUFACTURERS SHIFTING OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>More leading U.S. manufacturers plan to
increase the proportion of their U.S.-based production
vis-a-vis their overseas output over the next two years,
according to a Boston University School of Management survey.
    The Manufacturing Roundtable 1987 study showed 32 pct of
manufacturers plan to shift output to their domestic plants
from their overseas ones, or simply increase the production in
their U.S. plants.
    That was up from 19 pct expecting to make that shift in
1986, and only 12 pct in 1984.
    The Boston University survey canvassed 207 firms.
    The largest group of those surveyed, 44 pct, planned no
changes in their U.S./overseas operations, while 23.7 pct said
they would boost the ratio of overseas output, the poll said.
    Jeffrey Miller, professor at the School of Management and
director of the Roundtable Survey, said that exchange rates
favored plans toward increased domestic production. But he
added that increased competitiveness seems to be behind the
move towards greater production in the United States.
    "What's peculiar about this group is that it's the most
successful in terms of profitability, decreasing costs, and
increasing quality," he told Reuters in an interview.
    Those companies increasing offshore production are at the
opposite end of the spectrum, he said, not meeting the
production goals they set for themselves.
    He cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large,
unusually profitable businesses representing a diversity of
industries and regions. The typical respondent was a large
manufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said
it closed down the insolvent United Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Durant, Okla, and turned its insured deposits
and other assets and liabilities over to a newly created,
federally chartered thrift.
    It said the failed thrift's four offices would reopen
tomorrow under Bank Board management.
    United, with assets of 9.31 mln dlrs, was closed because it
had substantially dissipated its assets and earnings due to
federal law violations and unsafe and unsound practices, the
thrift regulatory agency said.
    The Bank Board faulted the failed thrift for its large
holdings of substandard loans made in 1984-85 due to "imprudent
underwriting policies and controls on loans for construction
and other purposes throughout the United States."
    It also charged the thrift had violated federal rules
governing conflicts of interest, loans to a single borrower and
changes of control.
    The thrift was the 27th federally insured savings and loan
to be closed down by the bank board so far this year.

<TITLE>U.S. COULD APPROVE EGYPTIAN M-1A TANK PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Defense Department said it
has given preliminary approval for Egypt to produce the M-1A
tank, the main battle tank of the United States.
    The State and Defense Departments said talks were going on
between the two countries dealing with Egypt's ability to build
the tank and protect its high technology secrets.
    The U.S. Army signed a contract four weeks ago to pay
General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD> 3.5 billion dlrs over the next four
years to build 3,299 of the tanks.
    Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, told
Reuters Congress probably will not be officially notified of
any final plan until after October 1. Congress would then have
30 days to veto Egypt as the first foreign co-producer of the
M-1A.
    U.S. defense officials said Congress could approve the plan
because Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace
treaty with Israel. But they said the issues of technology
transfer and a possible loss of U.S. jobs could raise problems
for the plan while Israel would also be expected to lobby
against any production agreement.

<TITLE>STATE TO CONTROL 70 PCT OF PAKISTAN TEA IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   ISLAMABAD, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan announced a new tea import
policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through
the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).
   Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television
broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct
allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from
any one country.
   The new policy was announced some three months after the
government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry
into tea purchase policy.
   Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya,
which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual
tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.
    Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever
Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders
said.
   Haq, who is also Planning Minister, was outlining a new
three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on
July 1.

<TITLE>JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO RECORD 3.2 PCT IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the
government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953,
the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct
marked set in January and April this year. It was also up
sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up
from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier.
    An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the
strong yen for the rise in unemployment.
    The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose
to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set
in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a
year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up
180,000 from a year earlier.
    The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from
April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct.
Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.
    The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in
manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell
210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS G-7 STILL SUPPORTS LOUVRE ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre
Accord to stabilise currencies.
    He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting
that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to
meet for talks.
    The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock
market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock
market. "There is no special worry about the stock market in
Tokyo," he added.
    Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely
affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London
because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan
and stability of exchange rates.
    Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock
market plunge in New York, Miyazawa said there was not any
contact.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA SEES FLAT OIL PRICE DESPITE U.S. ATTACK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>World oil prices would remain stable
despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and
growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo
Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He described the situation as "extremely tense," but said
Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
because supply and demand were roughly equal.
    Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5
mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now
pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
continued.
    Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries were "overproducing in an
exaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.
    OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.
