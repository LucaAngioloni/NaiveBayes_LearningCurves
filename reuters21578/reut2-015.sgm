<TITLE>DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roughly half of this year's expected
130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start," he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPECTS SUBSTANTIAL DEMAND FOR ROLLS SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Demand for shares in state-owned engine
maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> is expected to be substantial when the
government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark
of the group's bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said.
    He told a press conference after the release of an initial
prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to
U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.
    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be
made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.
    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond
saying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.
    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would
be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April
28.
    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment
in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous
privatisations.
    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls
was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted
that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had
several operations -- such as spare parts and military
equipment -- that evened out the swings.
    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986
was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary
according to changes in turnover.
    He noted that net research and development expenditure was
written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received
"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant
forecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.
    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to
120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.

<TITLE>VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.
    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
around three billion marks at end-1985.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian government has no immediate
plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
official of the ruling party said.
    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
which at least 15 people died.
    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
a practice discouraged by the IMF.
    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of
Agriculture economist said.

<TITLE>MEDICAL JOURNAL REPORTS NEW INTERLEUKIN PROMISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Promising new findings in the use of
a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a
cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a
Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the
magazine.
    Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp
&lt;CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp
&lt;IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.
    The journal, to be released late today, contains two
articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.
    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding
that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search
for a successful immunotherapy for cancer.
    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally
produced by living cells in the laboratory.
    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as
a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its
effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year
later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its
ravaging side effects.
    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of
Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly
significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after
it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer
patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers
and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart
Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.
    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no
remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side
effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital
care, according to the article.
    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers
administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct
remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in
melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.
    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four
patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness
of the drug's side effects as originally administered.
    "Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search
for successful immunotherapy for cancer," said the editorial,
signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.
    "These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely
did not describe successful practical approaches ready for
widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients," the

<TITLE>REPORT SEEKS TO DISALLOW SOUTHERN &lt;SO> COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATALANTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>An audit submitted to the Georgia
Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and
1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power
station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.
    Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct
interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would
cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant's
owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost
passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.
    The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report
by O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said the
report was released yesterday by the state attorney general.
    Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman
Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn
by the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same
bias against nuclear power that these auditors have
demonstrated in similar cases accross the country."
    Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without
fault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wish
we had done differently."
    Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submitted
to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power
would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.
    Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in
commercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latest
report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no
credit for the completion and "actually penalized us by
suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."
    Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could
have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts,
seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.
    He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for
another year "and it would have cost several hunderd million
dlrs more."
    Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by
schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we have
the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new
government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident
significantly increased construction time.

<TITLE>FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain producers adjusted
their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
crops, including soybean.
    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln.
    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
previously.
    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
tonnes.
    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
Buenos Aires in mid-April.
    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
mln tonne crop.
    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
7.1 mln.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
sown in 1985/86.
    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
this were not available.
    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
not been as intense as in previous years.

<TITLE>DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600
at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March
1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
    The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for
women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier
and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
    On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was
725,000.
    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
building industry. He said this explained the increase in the
adjusted statistics.
    Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at
end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

affirmed the long-term debt ratings but cut the commercial
paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1 of Avco Financial Services Inc, a
unit of Avco Corp.
    Avco Financial has 2.5 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    For the paper cut, Moody's cited a higher risk profile
inherent in the company's core business. Moody's said the
affirmation reflected its assessment of a less diversified risk
profile in the company's receivables.
    Affirmed were Avco Financial's A-3 senior debt, Baa-2
senior subordinated debt and Baa-3 junior subordinated debt.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top officials of leading industrial
nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a
meeting of the Group of Five.
    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.
    Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and
British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor
Robin Leigh Pemberton.
    There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian
officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of
the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when
a communique is expected to be issued.
    Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
    At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful
decisions.

temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs

two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. Some also look
for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures
via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.
     The Federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at

<TITLE>FORD &lt;F> EXTENDS INCENTIVES ON LIGHT TRUCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DEARBORN, Mich., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co said it extended
its buyer incentive program on light trucks to April 30 from
April 6, the program's previous expiration date.
    Ford, which saw a 23 pct rise in its March truck sales over
the March 1986 level, said the incentives were extended to
"maintain its truck sales momentum."
    The program itself was not changed. Customers have a choice
of 3.9 to 9.9 annual percentage rate financing or a cash rebate
of 300 dlrs or 600 dlrs, depending on the type of transmission
chosen.
    Ford last week extended to April 30 from March 12 its
incentive program on its compact trucks and the Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable cars.

<TITLE>FAO REPORTS BETTER CROPS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>World output of staple foods maintained
growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and
most of the increase was in developing countries, the director
general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
said.
    Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security, Edouard
Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production
increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to
increase production.
    Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face
problems in paying for all the food they need, he said.
    Saouma said many of the developing world's food problems
were the result of "chaotic" world trade.
    He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the
"food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms in
developing countries to remove existing disincentives to
production so that agriculture could play a greater role in
stimulating economic growth.

<TITLE>ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
major company executives predicted.
    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
the old ones."
    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
by as much as 300 pct, he said.
    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
history.
    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire
chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
Oreffice said.
    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
U.S. chemical exports.
    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
in the early 1980s.
    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
    "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually
kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.
    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman
cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be
ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."
    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
along the Texas Gulf Coast.
    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
are the building blocks of specialty products.
    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand
is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

<TITLE>JAL BOEING CRASH CAUSED BY FAULTY REPAIRS-REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company
&lt;BA.N> was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd
&lt;JAPN.Y> 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people,
the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says.
    There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed
into a mountain north of Tokyo.
    The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by
Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the
crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the
disaster.
    The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in
late May. Under an international convention the draft must be
submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities.
    Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4,
a Boeing spokesman at the firm's headquarters said the company
would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation
team's report until it was officially released.
    On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the
1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did
not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the
crash.

filed a coutersuit in the U.S. District Court in Detroit
against Advanced Voice Technologies and that it denied all

enter the market and compete with Advanced through a public

<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Victorian Corporate Affairs
Commission, CAC, said it had suspended the futures trading
licence of G H Shintoh (Australia) Ltd after a receiver was
appointed to the company's South Australian branch.
    The one month suspension followed consultation with the
Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh
concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said.
    The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of
a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an
associate member of the SFE, the CAC said.
    Shintoh's is the first licence suspended under a Futures
Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1,
1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters.
    Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated
with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in
receivership earlier this year, he said.

<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> RECOMMENDED BY FIRST BOSTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Boston Corp analyst William
Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying
"the discount that investors have made in the share price to
reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone
relative to how we expect the case to conclude."
    Texaco's stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8.
    On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme
Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texaco's bond
in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> to
one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary
injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week.
    The current litigation arose from Texaco's buyout of Getty
Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to
buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoil's
position.
     Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in
the two years since the litigation was filed, said "we
recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone
it."
    He said "the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value,
and we think it represents a good value at this level."

    But an average dollar rate of only 2.07 guilders against

turnover for January to March this year in guilder terms to

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain intends to negotiate further
agreements on international securities regulation to match
those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources
said.
    The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had
concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japan's Finance
Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information.
    The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds,
but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not
come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover
some transactions on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges.
    The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with
other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The
meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the
U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany
and Holland.
    Government sources said the deal with Japan completes
arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K.
Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) was signed last September.
    Today's agreement will deal with requests for information
on a "case by case" basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is
not legally binding and comes into force immediately.

<TITLE>DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a
published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington
Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
    "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman Michel
Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
    "All the information that has been given out publicly is
that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an
acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
starting all sorts of rumors," he said.
    Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
was out of town and unavailable for comment.
    Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
    Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"
U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
Industries was one of them.
    Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher
Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
takeover offer.
    Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has
repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. 
   The company has said it plans to diversify into new product
and market areas in addition to expanding its textile
operations.

3.55 billion dlr U.S. defense contract was awarded shortly
after the close of the first quarter.

<TITLE>COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    YAOUNDE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major cocoa exporters are likely to
limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
Alliance (CPA) said.
    The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
11-member CPA which began on Monday.
    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
effort to support prices.
    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
market soon.
    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
to buy cocoa under stock rules.
    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"
commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
commodity marketing boards.
    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Storage problems with Brazil's record
grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

<TITLE>REUTERS CHAIRMAN URGES FREER INFORMATION FLOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exchanges and telecommunications
authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free
dissemination of information to the investment and banking
communities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> chairman Sir
Christopher Hogg said.
    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges
for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
through Reuter services.
    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.
    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
information restrictions protected their interests.
    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
to their own commercial information businesses.
    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
sectors.
    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire
economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.
    Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from
the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues
to 620.9 mln stg.
    Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The
annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.

<TITLE>PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of White Metals has
decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per
100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was
introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for
some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals
association said.
    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and
Tuesday's at 4,790.
    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a
tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin
trading on October 24, 1985.
    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a
French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was
reliable, the spokesman said.
    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a
minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway
station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
    The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various
metal associations including the Association of White Metals.

<TITLE>SHAD WANTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition
of insider trading but thought action should wait until the
Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case.
    "I'd like the benefit of the Winans decision before
deciding on a definition," Shad told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee hearing.
    Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street
Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider
trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he
was going to write about in his column.
    The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on
Winans' recommendation.
    He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of
the SEC's enforcement activities last year despite the
publicity given to recent major cases.
    "Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct
of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading," Shad said.
    Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge 
its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal
with all types of securities fraud.
    Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S.
Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know
when his successor would be named by President Reagan.

<TITLE>MONTEDISON'S AGRIMONT UNIT 1986 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Montedison SPA> of Italy said net
consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
    Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
    Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
    The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
    In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
1986, Montedison said.
    Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
created position of president of Agrimont.
    Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing
director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing
director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members
of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's
board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison,
the company said.

<TITLE>MILLER SAYS REAGAN WILL REJECT TAX INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Office of Management and Budget
Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax
increase called for in the House Budget Committee's 1988 budget
proposal which is before the House for a vote today.
    "It's just completely unacceptable," Miller told a House
Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and
General Government Appropriations.
    The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget
committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of
which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing
committees.
    The House committee's budget proposal includes some
increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in
taxes.
    Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit
would jeopardize the U.S. economy.
    "If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this
economic expansion that we've had in the last five years at
risk," Miller told the subcommittee.
    "The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase
substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an
end," Miller said.

<TITLE>DUTCH CHEMICAL FIRM DSM TO BE PRIVATISED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HEERLEN, Netherlands, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch state-owned chemical
firm NV DSM &lt;DSMN.AS>, the former Dutch state mines, which
today reported a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 412 mln
guilders, said it was poised to be privatised, possibly next
year.
    DSM chairman Hans van Liemt told journalists "We have done
our homework. We're ready. It is up to the state now."
    He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSM's assets in 1988 was
not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in
the hands of Parliament.
    Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a
proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government
coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy
declaration last autumn.
    Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price,
but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98
mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit.
    "We ought to be able to match our German competitors on
price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally
has a lower ratio than the world's major exchanges, " he said.
    The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.

abroad fell to 11.2 billion marks in 1986 from 13.6 billion in
1985, but investments in developing countries rose to 683 mln

    Foreign investments in West Germany were a net 5.8 billion
marks in 1986, up from 3.6 billion in 1985, with higher
European investments largely responsible for this increase.
    The ministry noted that, despite last year's rise in West
German investments in developing countries, the 1986 level was
below the investments of over two billion marks seen in 1981,
1982 and 1983.

<TITLE>CME ADDS COMPLIANCE CHIEF, EXPANDS SURVEILLANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will
expand its regulatory surveillance program.
    Paul O'Kelly, currently assistant regional administrator of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named
vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said.
    The expanded compliance program, which calls for an
increase in the exchange's compliance budget and addition of
staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CME's
current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased
demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said.
    The new surveillance program calls for the addition of
three floor investigators and five compliance investigators,
the CME said.
    Some of the new staff will monitor the exchange's new
Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start
July 1.
    In addition, three computer programmers will be added to
assist in regulatory support for the exchange's management
information system department.
    Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CME's
Standard and Poor's stock index futures and options division.
    A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members
from filling customer orders and trading for their own account
in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13.
    In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and
Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to
reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules.
    Included in the rule changes was the requirement that
futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal
trades to the nearest minute, intended to "enhance the
effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions,"
    "We made a promise to our members that we have kept,"
Melamed said in a release today.
    He said the new surveillance program "represents a
commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy."

<TITLE>POLAND REASSURES CREDITORS ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economy
by reducing central government control would help reassure
Western creditors that the country's economy was safe to invest
in, a senior Polish official said.
    "The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a
business as you might imagine," senior Polish government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.
    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at
the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that
Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state
companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.
    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in
the coming weeks, he said.
    Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt
burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges
but  the long term looked more secure.
    He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,
grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortly
solve the problem of short term servicing.
    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the
expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for
economic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."
    He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western
governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political
considerations ahead of economic co-operation.
    "After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish
economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed,
but that has not been the case," Urban said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran decided to continue its operations
east of Basra to destroy Iraq's forces, Iranian Prime Minister
Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio.
    "That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction
of (Iraqi President) Saddam's forces. This is why it was
decided that the operations would forcefully continue there," he
said.
    "At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act
throughout the length of the fronts," Mousavi told the radio,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
    Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as
Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early
yesterday.
    Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded
yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the
latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties.
    Mousavi told Tehran radio that "on the whole, our advances
have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam."
    Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehran's
forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on
Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraq's second city.
    In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today
destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at
Iran's Ahvaz field.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The largest U.S. textile maker focused
on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make," she said.
    "You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past," Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>
rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.

<TITLE>JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
variety of Japanese electronic exports.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
including television and audio equipment and computers.
    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
Japan was not honoring the agreement.
    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
provide American industry with free and fair trade."
    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To
stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."
    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

<DATELINE>    SOMERVILLE, N.J., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp> said it
sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its
polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South
Carolina.
    The company did not disclose any prices.
    The report describes the facilities in Darlington County,
S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also
decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and
technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer.
    Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of
Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place
after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade
Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets
of the combined companies would be divested, it said.
    Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either
the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or
a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former
Celanese.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Treasury official said there are no
plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing
yen-denominated bonds that would become known as "Reagan bonds."
    "It simply isn't something that we are planning to do," the
official said.
    He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports
suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as
the former Carter administration did when it sold "Carter bonds"
denominated in West German marks.
    But he said the situation was greatly different now.
    "If you look at the differences between the treasury market
now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more
global market now," the official said.
    "There was not the same ease then for the holder of another
currency to buy other countries' securities," he added, "But
there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy
U.S. securities."
    The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay
its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue
yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.

dispute with Union Rural Electric Association of Brighton,
Colo.
    The company said, "The tentative agreement protects Union's
boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of Union's
membership, which could lead to acquisition of Union by Public
Service Co."
    Union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members
in cities and rural areas north of Denver.
    The company said the settlement, which is pending before
the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, is under review by
the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which
supplies power to Union, and is subject to approval by the
Public Service Colorado board and Union's membership. It also
will be discussed with the Colorado Rural Electric Association.
    It said legislation that would halt the acquisition of
electric utility service territories by annexation will remain
active in the Colorado House of Representatives until Union and
Public Service assure legislators they are in agreement.

<TITLE>ADVANCED MICRO &lt;AMD> UNVEILS COMPUTER CHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Advanced Micro Devices Inc said it is
developing a set of five computer chips for use in digital
communications systems.
    The company said the new chips support the integrated
services digital network, or ISDN, the international standard
for digital voice and data communications.
    Advanced Micro also said it has signed a licensing
agreement with American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> under
which ATT has provided it with certain digital communications
specifications.
    Today's announcement follows the company's introduction
last week of a 32-bit microprocessor.
    "We have now reached a key point in the development of
communications devices that implement a worldwide ISDN
standard," said John East, group vice president for Advanced
Micro's logic businesses.
    He said the company's new computer chips, to be available
by the end of this year, should boost the acceptance and
implementation of ISDN services.
     The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unit
quantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25
dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are already
being sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp
&lt;INTC>, ATT, Rockwell International &lt;ROK> and a joint venture
between Northern Telecom LTd &lt;NT> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT>.
    The ISDN standard, portions of which are still being
defined, will provide for the simultaneous transmission of
voice, data and video.
    Advanced Micro chip sets will be used in equipment such as
private branch exchanges and desktop computers.
    The company also said it is developing an ISDN protocol
controller. It said the controller will connect directly with
its current line of ISDN devices.
    The device supports several digital communications
protocols, including ones from International Business Machines
Corp &lt;IBM> and ATT.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Budget Committee
ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single
vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles
to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year.
    The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the
committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie
vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11.
    Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles
added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified,
agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with
higher user fees.

<TITLE>QUEBEC GOVERNMENT TO OFFER HELP TO NORANDA MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUEBEC, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said
the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open
(Noranda Inc)'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by
fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure
until damage estimates have been completed.
    Federal member of parliament for the region, Charles-Eugene
Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared
to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as
possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about
10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more
specific estimate by the end of the month.
    Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but
has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access
to the burned-out area.
    Noranda said the mine was not insured.
    "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all
of Noranda's underground operations would have been
prohibitive," Larry Taylor, Noranda's risk management and
insurance director, said.
    Taylor said before last week's fire, the company had only
had one previous mine accident many years ago.
    Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other
underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have
started on a new conveyor system.
    Noranda has said it would take four to five months to
return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced
72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,
taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg
from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International
Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.
    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to
150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.
    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over
a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability
had warranted a cut in deposit rates.
    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after
consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the
spokesman said.
    The cuts were likely to attract more business to the
market, he said.

suspicion of espionage in a growing sex-spy scandal involving
security at both the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the American
Consulate in Leningrad, the Pentagon said.
    Sgt. John Joseph Weirick, 26, was arrested yesterday in
California and jailed for questioning on suspicion of espionage
while he served as a guard at the U.S. consulate in Leningrad
for a year beginning in October, 1981, Pentagon spokesman

    Two other Marines were earlier charged with espionage at
the Moscow Embassy and a third Marine, Staff Sgt. Robert
Stufflebeam, was charged yesterday with failure to report
contacts with Soviet women in Moscow, Sims told reporters.

<TITLE>PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC &lt;PE> NUCLEAR COST ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philadelphia Electric Co will have
to spend an average of about five mln dlrs a day to replace the
electricity which would have been generated by the Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant, Chairman J. Lee Everett said.
    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the utility to
close the plant early last week.
    "This is the first time an operating plant has been shut
down by the NRC specifically because of plant operator
problems," Everett told the company's annual meeting.
    He did not say who would pay for the replacement power --
rate payers or shareholders.
    Everett told the meeting Philadelphia Electric can not give
a definitive answer on the cost of the shutdown until it gets
Peach Bottom back in service.
    He said the utility had been aware for some time it had
attitude problems among the operating forces at Peach Bottom
and thought it had been making progress toward improvement.
    "While the attitude of operating personnel at Peach Bottom
has been rated poor, the attitudes or our personnel at
Limerick, our other nuclear plant, have been rated excellent.
We have asked ourselves over and over how two plants, managed
by the same company, can be so different."
    Everett said "Limerick has been the model for improvements
we set out to accomplish at Peach Bottom, and remains so."
    He said a special committee composed of Philadelphia
Electric's outside directors will monitor and direct the
company's investigation of the problem.

<TITLE>HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
to extend world penetration.
    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We
have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that
while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
regionalized.
     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
important beer growth markets in the long term.
     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
1986 sales.
    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
have been looking at other possibilities.
    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not
possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.
    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
money.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombia government trade official has
urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
    Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
Colombia's major export.
    The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.

<TITLE>TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey said today its disputes with
Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, should be solved through negotiations.
    A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between
the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
economy and other rights of both countries.
    "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has
repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
International Court of Justice.
    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.
    A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to
territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic
opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,"
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
    Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to
meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek
reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.

<DATELINE>    HAVANA, APRIL 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuba will continue to develop its economy
despite the need to cut imports from hard currency nations by
half this year, President Fidel Castro said.
    The Cuban economy is going through a difficult period due
mainly to two years of drought, low sugar prices, a fall in the
price of petroleum and the fall in the value of the dollar,
Castro said in a published weekend speech delivered to a young
communists union congress.
    Castro said  cuba will continue to prospect for oil, build
thermo-electric generating stations, a large petroleum refinery
and a nuclear power plant in 1987.
    He said work would also continue this year in developing
the chemical and mining industries. Among the main projects in
mining are two nickel processing plants built with Soviet and
Comecon aid .

<TITLE>GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The official in charge of
agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
Reagan administration officials.
    Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
with members of the House Agriculture Committee.
    Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over
protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers
noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan
rates, committee staff said.
    "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan
rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source
said.
    De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with
Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended
the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by
subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.
    Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture
members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.
    Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means
Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before
visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
    De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North
America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in
the key GATT member states.
    The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting
in February and is expected to meet again in May.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates."
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

<TITLE>MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
1988.
    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases," he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets."
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry."
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition."
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

<TITLE>IBM &lt;IBM> NAMES NEW PRESIDENT FOR ROLM UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ARMONK, N.Y., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business Machines
Corp said IBM vice president Ray S. AbuZayyad has been named
president of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D.
Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.
    The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has been
named president of the IBM General Products Division,
succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardo
has been named president of IBM's General Technology Division,
succeeding Low.
    A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down for
personal reasons.
    His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move last
month to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into its
own marketing corps.
    That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm's
independence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing and
product development site within IBM.
    "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said,
adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.
    Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makes
telephone exchanges and other communications equipment, since
it was acquired by IBM in 1984.
    Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more than
a year ago.
    Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack of
coordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate the
unit lost money last year.
    But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the way
things are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its best
fourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter.

industry is expected to rise to 1.4 billion stg this year, a
three pct increase on the 1986 level after inflation, the

    A further increase to 1.52 billion stg is expected in 1988,
but there will be a decline to 1.38 billion in 1989, the
association found in its latest investment intentions survey.
    Even so, the estimated total fixed capital spending for the

six pct on the previous three years, the report said.
Eighty-one firms took part in the survey.

November that it would close 11 plants. At that time, General
Motors said the line would be closed "by August."
    At Flint, "layoffs could reach 2,000," the automaker said.
Some 1,400 workers on the line will be transferred to other
locations or put in a job placement program. The second line at
the plant is not affected.
    General Motors also said it will close the truck and bus
plant in St. Louis on August seven.
    General Motors did not specify how many of the 2,200
workers at the facility would be laid off, but said "many of
those employees will be transferring toother General Motors
operations in the area."
    In the automaker's previous announcement, it said the
facility would be closed by "mid-1987."
    General Motors said the full-size pickup trucks currently
being built of Flint's Line One are being replaced by a new
full-size pickup truck being assembled at Fort Wayne, Ind., and
at renovated plants in Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ont.
    The St. Louis plant makes full-size pickup trucks,
including crew cab models. The production is being phased out
as the Fort Wayne, Pontiac and Oshawa plant begin to produce
General Motors' new redesigned 1988 full-size pickup. Crew cab
truck output is being shifted to Janesvile, Wis.

<TITLE>TALKS CONTINUE ON TIN AGREEMENT EXTENSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Discussions on the possible extension of
the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the
quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but
the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member
states.
    A number of producer governments in particular have not
decided their final position on whether the ITA should be
extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on
June 30, according to delegate sources.
    Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to
back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which
undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.
    Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member
countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT
after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC
coordination meeting.
    The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although
delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor
technical matters and the main issue will probably not be
discussed before the afternoon session.

Tariffs on Japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as
scheduled on April 17, despite an all-out effort by Japan to
avoid them.
    Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one
day before U.S. And Japanese officials are to meet under the
emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to
discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.
    Fitzwater said: "I would say Japan is applying the
full-court press...They certainly are putting both feet forward
in terms of explaining their position." But he added that "all
indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."

<TITLE>EC PLANS FOR CASH PAYMENTS TO FARMERS IMPEDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Controversial plans to pay
Western Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grants
to leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meeting
of the European Community (EC) Commission, officials said.
    They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runs
the Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over the
proposals which some people argue could lead to national
capitals having too much say in EC farm policies.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing paying
farmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leave
the land. EC member states would be permitted to top up
payments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the average
national farm income.
    The package would also include an early retirement scheme,
details of which have yet to be unveiled.
    Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy --
the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted food
production -- more acceptable to countries with large farming
communities.
    With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budget
swallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in the
long-run the payments would lead to considerable savings.

<TITLE>SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showboat Inc will take a
charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

<TITLE>SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Security Pacific Corp said it is
placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a
non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first
quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
taxes.
    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
reported for the first quarter of 1986.
    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
February.
    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
country's export revenues.
    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
interest income only as it is received in cash.
    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
later in 1987.
    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
debt that matures on April 15.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its troops were pushing
Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied
when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
Basra early yesterday.
    A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a
significant victory and were continuing to advance.
    Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
(six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three
divisions attacked.
    The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under
assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery
and tanks.
    "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge
the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.
    (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
    The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil
installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot
down.
    Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of
the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore
terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to
attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

    It said the rules apply to unregulated brokers and dealers,
who must be registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by July 25.
    NASD said it could guarantee brokers and dealers would meet
the July 25 deadline if it received application materials by
April 15. After April 15, it said it will make every effort to
meet the July 25 deadline, but could not guarantee it.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is
preparing a proposal that would require all foreign meat
products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the
United States, a USDA official said.
    Donald Houston, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, FSIS, told a House Agriculture subcommittee
USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would
put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat
products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another
port.
    Houston said the requirement would be phased in over
several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."

<TITLE>UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
area.
    "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices," the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
well as petrochemical-related businesses.

<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc may have a response this
afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    "The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
said Pettee.
    "What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody," he said.

<TITLE>HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hartmarx Corp, following a year of
restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal
1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
    Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
    The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
ago.
    Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to
take advantage of acquisitions."
    In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
    He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

<TITLE>SALOMON &lt;SB> SEES MORE STOCK GAINS WORLDWIDE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc say
the outlook for stock markets worldwide is postivie, although
total returns in the U.S. stock market are not expected to
exceed 10 pct over the next 12 months.
    The report by Robert Salomon Jr and Caroline Davenport said
that after a strong first quarter, which saw U.S. stock market
indices rise more than 20 pct, the direction of the market is
still upward because slower economic growth will stretch out
the recovery period. The firm expects profits for companies in
the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index to rise 17 pct in 1987
and 18 pct in 1988. 
    The bullish global outlook is underpinned by continued but
subdued economic growth, fiscal restraint, good liquidity and
increasing profits, Salomon said.
    The Salomon analysts say potential risks which must be
monitored include any shift toward protectionism and foreign
buying of U.S. stocks particularly by the Japanese. "A sharp
run-up in stock prices in secondary stocks" would be a warning
sign, as would a big increase in enthusiasm for the initial
public offering market," Salomon said.
    Salomon said global diversification of equity markets has
reached a new peak.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well," he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future," he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets," Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
said.

afternoon.
    Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said on entering
the meeting the ministers would review the Paris agreement.
Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese
stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more."
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile,
confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the

    Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain, FRance,
Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents
returning to a Treasury building.
    Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier
Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time
(1800 gmt).
    There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose
position was thrown into question this morning by the
resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's
Socialist-led government.
    European monetary officials said later that the Italian
delegation was inside the building.
    This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
consumers charged.
    "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
    "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute.
    "Company management is less concerned about the risk to
health than about raising plant output and company profits,"
Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in
the entire inspection system."
    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to
flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
their noses."
    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected
public health programs in the world."
    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
billion chicken and turkeys every year.
    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
the meat and poultry supply has increased.
    He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
and much money to contain the growing problem.
    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
    "We certainly really have not found an effective means of
turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
detecting microoganisms.
    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
would cost too much.
    "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,
executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
Purveyors, said.
    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
legal recourse."
    Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
April 23."
    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward
a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: "There are no glitches."
    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I
can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

<TITLE>GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric Corp said its
first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
communications and related services.

<TITLE>TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Teck Corp> said it
was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at
Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco
Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when
negotiations would be completed.
    Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in
reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long
time." He declined to speculate on the outcome.
    Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is
optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don
Townson told Reuters.
    "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be
resolved," Cominco's Townson said.
    "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he
added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.
    Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January
1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley
copper operations.
    Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management
of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct
share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.
    For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture
officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore
milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct
copper, Townson said.
    Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of
copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum
in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of
gold, he said.
    A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM
(Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired its
Cominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP>.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>Angered by late flights and
complicated restrictions on discount air fares, a senator has
introduced legislation to make airlines provide more details on
fares and schedules in their advertisements.
    Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the bill's sponsor, said airline ads
now are often misleading because they do not give prospective
passengers enough facts about discount fares.
    "Air travelers are lured by low advertised fares which
simply aren't available," the New Jersey Democrat said in a
statement. "It's the old bait and switch."
    Airline advertisements usually say discount seats are
limited, but Lautenberg said more information was needed.

<TITLE>XEBEC &lt;XEBC> TO REPORT 2ND QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS GATOS, Calif., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Xebec Corp said it expects to
report a loss for its second quarter ended April three, due
principally to a decline in sales to International Business
Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, the company's largest customer.
    Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln
dlrs.
    The company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9
mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.
    Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct
of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during

delivered at its annual meeting in San Francisco, reiterated
its expectation of a loss in the first quarter.
    It said results would be hurt by a 25 mln dlr one-time
charge by Caterpillar Mitsubishi, a 50-pct owned affiliate. The
company said it expected profit from operations for the full
year to improve over 1986.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, President
Peter Donis said Caterpillar's targeted five pct cost reduction
in 1987 "will be difficult to achieve because the weaker dollar
has limited opportunities to obtain lower material costs."

<TITLE>AIRBUS SIGNS ACCORD ON CFM ENGINE FOR A340 PLANE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortium
today formally signed an agreement with the Franco-U.S. Group
&lt;CFM International> for an improved version of the CFM56-5
engine to power the A340-200 and A340-300 aircraft, an Airbus
statement said.
    Airbus said yesterday that it chosen the CFM56-5-S3 engine,
to be produced by &lt;General Electric> of the U.S. And &lt;SNECMA of
France, because the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) high
technology superfan engine would not be ready by early 1992,
when the A340 plane is due to become operational.
    The five-nation IAE consortium has decided not to go ahead
with the proposed launch of the superfan, a spokesman for
consortium member &lt;Rolls-Royce Plc> said today, adding that the
project had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.
    Airbus said the CFM56-5-S3 will have a thrust of 30,600 lbs
and an improved fuel burn of four per cent compared with the
CFM56-5A1 which is now being operated on the A320 flight-test
aircraft. It will be available for deliveries of the A340 in
May 1992.
    At the same time, the Airbus statement said Airbus
Industrie and General Electric have concluded an accord for an
improved version of the GE CF6-80C2 engine, with 64,000 lbs of
thrust and a three per cent improvement in specific fuel
consumption, to power the A330 aircraft which will be
introduced in spring 1993.
    "This continues the long-standing history of all Airbus
launches being made with either GE or CFMI engines," Airbus
Industrie president Jean Pierson said in the statement.
    "Airbus Industrie has already worked with CFMI to launch one
new aircraft programme - the A320 - in early 1984, and is happy
to build on this relationship by launching the A340 with an
improved version of the same engine," Pierson said.
    Airbus Industrie said it has so far received a total of 128
commitments for the A340 and A330 from nine customers.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
tonnes from the United States.
    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Group of 24 developing countries
said in a communique that some kind of debt relief is necessary
and called for "a new attitude" on the part of the banks.
    The communique, released in conjunction with the semiannual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
said the very low income countries needed a cancellation of
debt to industrial countries, a conversion of part of their
debt into grants and a rescheduling on concessional terms.
    For some other countries, the communique said, the debt
cannot be properly serviced if the countries are to grow at the
same time.
    "The debt overhang effects the capacity to grow as it
reduces the ability to import," the communique said.
    It added: "Some kind of debt relief and a new attitude on
the part of the banks is necessary."
    The communique added that debtor countries and banks have
to explore new market mechanisms, debt into equity swaps,
capitalization of interest and writeoffs.

their interest rate would be set by the central bank. Textile,
commercial and fishing canneries with sales over 1.24 mln intis
would have to buy bonds equal to 20 pct of profits.
    The firms would have to buy the bonds between April and
December 1987.
   The decree said the government adopted the move to obtain
financing for high-priority investment projects, which it did
not specify.
    The economy ministry says it aims to keep the public
sector's budget deficit to between five and six pct of the
gross domestic product (gdp).
    Last year, the deficit was six pct of gdp, according to the
central bank.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>All steers imported into the United
States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the
right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for
bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to
identify Mexican steers.
    The requirement is not expected to affect the number of
Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand
will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of
entry.
    Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export
quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87
season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.

results will show a loss, Chairman Lloyd I. Miller told told
the annual meeting.
    The company reported a profit of 365,883 dlrs, 23 cts a
share, for the first quarter last year with one cent a share
coming from non-operating factors, a spokesman said.
    Miller attributed the expected loss to completion of the
purchase transfer and consolidation of operating assets of the
O'Sullivan Rubber Division, saying this was proving more costly
and taking more time than originally anticipated.
    Vulcan is working to resolve the problems, Miller told
shareholders, adding it appears it will take most of 1987 to
find solutions.

seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
collateral or under price support programs.
    The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
    The department said it is possible that producers could be
encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
the premiums and discounts.
    Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
required by law by May 10.

<TITLE>WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve will promote lower
interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.
    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

<TITLE>CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada plans to monitor steel shipments
flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease
concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel
exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.
    "To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,
the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not
used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"
Carney said.
    Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to
exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were
considering establishing a joint commission to study the
growing steel problem.
    Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an
amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the
monitoring program.
    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the
level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.
    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic
steel industry.
    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
American market be limited to 2.4 pct.

<TITLE>U.S.SENATE LIFTS SOME BANS ON NATURAL GAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate unanimously approved
legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
plants.
    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
pay higher than market prices.
    "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
Lousiana Democrat said.
    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
    "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
Johnston said.
    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
fuel.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LAND VALUE DECLINE MODERATES--USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of U.S. farmland declined
again last year, but less than in the previous year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Agricultural Resources Report, the
department said on February 1, 1987, the average value per acre
of farmland stood at 548 dlrs, down eight pct from a year
earlier. Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.
    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, also
declined less than in 1985, because of the low rate of
inflation in 1986.
    Real values fell 10 pct compared to 14 pct in 1985, it
said.
    The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,
which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declines
appear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stable
values in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.
    The continuing downturn in values reflects the large
acreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern 
about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,
the department said.
    Those factors tend to offset the effects of relatively high
cash farm income, lower interest rates, and reduced operating
expenses, it said.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> SEES FLAT PIPELINE VOLUMES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said it expected oil and
fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
charge was incurred.
    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ministers from the Group of 24
developing coutries said that the debt crisis was entering a
new and dangerous phase and called for the formation of a
ministerial committee to examine solutions to the problem.
    In a statement following a meeting of the ministers, they
said that the "existing (debt) strategy offers no prospect for a
lasting solution to the debt problem."
    The statement said that there should be a new attitude and
approach in respect of the existing stock of debt and called
for current flows and future credits to be examined by
governments, multilateral and banking institutions.
    The statement also said that the prospects of the least
developed countries continue to deteriorate and "will improve
only if commensurate financing on concessional terms is made
available."

reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of
Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said.
    Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the
reasons was that the market was already saturated and that
producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln
(60-kg) bags in 1987.
    Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> STAYS ON S/P WATCH, NEGATIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it is
keeping 230 mln dlrs of debt of Caesars World Inc and Caesars
World Finance Corp on creditwatch with negative implications.
    S and P cited Caesars World's proposed recapitalization
plan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank and
other debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend and
the repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.
    It said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenants
in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of
those issues. Caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possible
downgrade March nine following investor Martin Sosnoff's bid.
    Sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the
86.4 pct of Caesars World stock he does not already own,
Standard and Poor's noted.
    The rating agency said an increase in Sosnoff's offer is
possible. If successful, the stock bid would markedly raise
Caesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net
income and cash flow, S and P said.
    Caesars World currently carries BB senior debt and B-plus
subordinated debt. The finance unit's subordinated debt, which
is guaranteed by the parent, is rated B-plus.

<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, Ga., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>HBO and Co said it sent a letter of
strongly urging shareholders not to sign any proxy cards sent
by Andover Group.
    ON March 30, Andover Group, a two-man general partnership
which owns about seven pct of HBO's stock, filed preliminary
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission
seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the
company's April 30 annual meeting.
    Andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
September 1986 but HBO has never received an offer from them,
it said.
    In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
implemented in 1986.
    It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
    For the year ended December 1986, the company reported a
loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.

    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period."
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
survive as a going concern," the report said.
    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
operations, it said.
    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet
these requirements. However, the company "believes it will be
able to do so," Hawkeye said.

<TITLE>S/P SEES STABLE CREDIT QUALITY IN FIRST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said that
corporate credit quality stabilized in the first quarter of the
year, even though downgrades outpaced upgrades.
    S and P said it reduced 79 debt ratings, affecting 63
billion dlrs of debt securities, and raised 28 ratings,
affecting 12 billion dlrs of debt.
    However, the rating agency pointed out that last quarter's
number of downgrades was the lowest since first quarter 1986.
It also said the upgrades were the fewest since early 1986.
    It said rating changes quieted in the oil and insurance
sectors, while utilities provided a positive influence.
    Standard and Poor's said its major downgrades last quarter
were of Denmark, USX Corp &lt;X>, Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>.
    It said the most negative influence on rating changes
occurred in the financial institution sector, where there were
22 downgrades versus five upgrades.
    Notably, ratings were reduced for several of the largest
U.S. bank holding companies, reflecting lower asset quality and
weaknesses that were specific to those firms, S/P said.
    Among industrials, S and P cut 43 ratings and raised 10.
Lower ratings prevailed in steel and health care, it said.

<TITLE>DOME &lt;DMP> PLAN MAY FORCE SALE OF ENCOR STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's proposal to
restructure debt of more than 6.10 billion Canadian dlrs
includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42
pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Inc>, Dome said in a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
    Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making
payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose
debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.
    After the five years are up, "under certain circumstances
the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed," the company
said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.
    Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell
the stock to pay down its debt.
    Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on
March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.
    As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in
principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the
filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in
early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.
    Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its
existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the
interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning
agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.
    "The company believes that the negotiation and
implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is
realistic and achievable," Dome said.
    "However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be
predicted at this time," it said.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. signed a
letter of intent with Agip Carbone and Arco Coal Co, a unit of
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> to exploit the coal deposits at
Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA officials said.
    The Carbozulia project will include open-pit mining of the
low sulphur content coal, as well as the construction of a
railroad and port facilities, at an estimated total cost of 500
mln dlrs.
    The Agip/Arco consortium will own 48 pct of Carbozulia,
while PDVSA will have 49 pct, with the remaining three pct to
be held by private investors.
    Carboulia President Luis Urdaneta said work will begin this
month on a preliminary test mine with a capacity of 500,000 mt
a year. A first shipment is scheduled to be ready by third
quarter 1987, he said.
    "The purpose of this trial shipment is to let potential
customers know about the quality of the Guasare coal," Urdaneta
said. Long-term plans call for Carbozulia to produce 6.5 mln mt
a year of by 1995, at which time coal exports are expected to
bring Venezuela some 200 mln dlrs a year.
    Agip Carbone President Francesco Coffrini said yesterday 60
pct of Carbozulia's coal will be exported to European markets.

<TITLE>DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial analysts say they are
pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
year.
        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley
Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander
said in an interview.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
with danger.
    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
should be stabilized at around current levels.
    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
agreed to cut its budget deficit.
    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
States.
    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
that any deficit reduction was better than none.
    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
from plunging further in world exchange markets.
    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.
    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
most vexing and persistent problems.
    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
federal budget.
    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,
said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that
would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."
    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now
look like a failure to Wall Street."
    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
anticipated spending levels for next year.
    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia's coffee export registrations
remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
association said.
    "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told
Reuters.
    On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and
May for an unlimited amount.
    Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters
had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
average in recent years.
    He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total
of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
Colombia.
    "The only change that could happen is, because of the
volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL'S CREDITORS MUST TRUST HIM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two
months ago, said creditors had to trust him when he said Brazil
would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue
servicing its debt.
    Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro said
he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside
his country, but added, "At the same time we show credibility,
you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."
    Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing
needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund, Funaro said, "What other options do
they have?...They have to try to see our program."
    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the Interim
Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank
and IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the
major creditor banks in New York yesterday.
    According to Funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the need
to find a solution to the crisis." He did not elaborate.
    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need
for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that
Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net
capital that it transferred over the past three years.
    He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to
ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11
billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.
    Administration officials familiar with the negotiations
said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense
based on current conditions in that country, and added that
they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.
    Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., told
Reuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bank
creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the
end of the year.
    But Preston, who did not attend the meeting between Funaro
and creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on Brazil
to put its economic house in order first.
    "They haven't even come up with a plan yet," Preston said
after Morgan's annual meeting in New York today.
    Funaro, however, said most creditor banks had
representatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's new
economic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation and
spending and a sharp drop in exports.
    Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and very
strong, adding that "it is very different from other years,
there has been a tremendous change."
    Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspension
of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pct
inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every
year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.

<TITLE>MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PATTI DOMM, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs
acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor
business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by
the tobacco company, analysts said.
     "They were very frustrated with their inability to get
Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It
doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said
Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.
    American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to
buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
    "This is just typical," said George Thompson of
Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come
here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"
he said.
cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
type of acquisition they envisioned.
    "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"
said Thompson.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term," Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
    "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
spokesman told Reuters.
    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
farm talks.
    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
Control Act.
    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
justified, it said.
    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

<TITLE>N.Z. GOVERNMENT POPULARITY RISES AHEAD OF ELECTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pritchett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's ruling Labour Party
government has just completed its three-year economic reform
which threw thousands of people out of work, yet its popularity
has risen as the September deadline for the election draws
closer, a recent poll shows.
    An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll, conducted for Television New
Zealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2, showed Labour
had the support of 50 pct of voters compared with the
opposition National Party's 46 pct.
    The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier.
    The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought the
economy would improve over the next year, up 12 points on last
month's result.
    The increase came in a week when the government turned
seven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run by
businessmen who promptly sacked some 4,000 employees, including
half the country's 1,700 coal miners.
    The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour's
days were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to its
traditional backers, the workers, political analysts said.
    The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party and
the arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas, who has
presided over the deregulation of the economy and the
construction of one based on market forces without subsidies or
currency controls, the analysts said.
    The economic reforms, by a party increasingly regarded in
New Zealand as more akin to the West European-style Social
Democrats than working class socialists, have rattled the
National Party, which is now regretting it was not as
innovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon was ousted in 1983, one analyst said.
    The National Party was further shaken, the analyst said,
when the Press, a Christchurch daily, said on April 2 the party
was "on the verge of flying apart" with the prospect of a coup
attempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said the
article was an April Fool's joke.
    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax
revenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, an
improvement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreign
debt and improved productivity, economists said.
    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended
March 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.
    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the most
dramatic was the "corporatisation" of seven government
departments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stage
step towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.
    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state will
retain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to be
financially self-supporting and pay dividends.
    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,
Electricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion
dlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.
    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the
former forest service, the analysts added.
    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had
been losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it now
employed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new
corporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln
dlrs in its first year.
    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the
only shareholder, retaining the right to order the new
corporations to undertake certain projects although the full
cost must be met by the state, the analysts said.
    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would
be held accountable for performance, with the government paying
for projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.
    This policy has already caused problems, the analysts
added. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several
hundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,
further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under
construction in Central Otago.
    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs
had decided last year that Luggate be built and it was
important that the government honour its promises.
    "But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see
many more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we
would save by having that promise honoured to the last," he
added.

the company for 47 dlrs a share.
    Based on 82 mln outstanding shares, the offer is worth
about 3.85 billion dlrs. But the company said that it would
take more than five billion dlrs to consummate the merger and
retire certain company debt.
    It said it does not believe the offer is in the best
interest of shareholders, but added that it is referring the
matter to its board for discussions and would respond in due
course.
    Hospital Corp of America said the letter was sent by
Charles Miller and Richard Ragsdale, two former officers of

Dallas law firm.
    The investors' letter stated that based on discussions with
several major financial institutions they were confident
financing for the transaction could be arranged, Hospital Corp

the investors had made arrangements to obtain financing.
    It said no further significant details were outlined in the

    Hospital Corp of America, a manager and owner of hospitals,
earned 174.6 mln dlrs or 2.08 dlrs a share, on revenues of 4.93
billion dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
they said.
    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"
said one diplomatic source.
    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source
said.
    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
said.
    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
face the situation."
    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    "What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.
"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view," he said.

<TITLE>MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of prime minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned
his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.
    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidate
in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several
conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry
against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.
    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down
before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10
if the LDP lost too many major local seats.
    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his
party to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and
analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.
    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of
polling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.
    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the
governorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre
parties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,
who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist
parties.
    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.
    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about
1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the
incumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,
professor of political science at Dokkyo University.
    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if
the LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.
    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the
governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.
    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei
University, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if
the LDP loses only in Hokkaido."
    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales
tax proposal.
    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to
overhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36
years.
    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese
domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax
revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating
the economy.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN SHARE MARKET CLOSES AT ALL-TIME HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Keen demand for gold stocks and quality
industrials pushed the Australian share market to all-time
highs in active trading, brokers said.
    A higher close on Wall Street, a strong local dollar and
easier domestic interest rates boosted sentiment in the
industrial sector, while demand for gold stocks continued
despite a slightly softer bullion price.
    Brokers said Western Mining featured in trading, gaining 30
cents to 9.00 dlrs after announcing a five-for-eight bonus
issue. By the close of trading, the all ordinaries index had
risen 12.5 points above yesterday's close to a record 1,771.6.
    The all industrials index gained 20.8 points to 2,639.3 and
the all resources 6.2 to 1,110.2. The gold index passed
yesterday's record close by 73.6 points to reach 3,156.2.
    National turnover was a high 206.7 mln shares worth 376.3
mln dlrs, with rises outnumbering falls five to three.
    Turnover was boosted by a large number of special sales,
including one for 5.0 mln Kalimantan Gold at 65 cents, 5.95 mln
Minora Resources at 23 cents, 3.57 mln Barrier Reef at 65, and
about 13 specials in Elders IXL totalling more than 2.0 mln
shares, brokers said. Elders rose 14 to 5.64 as more than 6.0
mln traded following news it will float Courage hotels.
    Elsewhere in the industrials sector, investors concentrated
on banking and insurance stocks and those in the food and
alcohol and tobacco sectors. ANZ gained 12 cents to 3.70 dlrs,
Westpac and National Australia four each to 5.06 and 5.64, and
FAI 10 to 10.60 after reaching a high of 10.90.
    Goodman Fielder advanced 10 to 4.60, Southern Farmers 20 to
8.40, and Arnotts 10 to 4.70. Amatil gained 10 to 10.70 and
Rothmans 20 to 7.20.
    Others to gain included Bell Group, up 15 to 10.85, IEL, 16
higher at 5.36, and Wormald, up 20 at 3.65. Coles Myer rose 20
to 7.00 after reports it plans to expand overseas.

<TITLE>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<TITLE>CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is likely to succeed in joining
GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
pct of world trade.
    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
application supported by the United States, Japan and the
European Community for political and economic reasons.
    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
Soviet Union," he said.
    "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet
Union. GATT is not a political body."
    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
and often contain subsidies.
    "Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try
to find out the real cost of something, officials do not give
you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do
not want to answer," he said.
    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in
February, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to
bring prices in line with real production costs and replace
administrative controls with market ones.
    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies
such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China
would not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as
a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.
    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are
small, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.
    "It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for
instance," the diplomat said. "It could have a very large impact
on world trade."
    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its
companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for
vitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.
    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of
grain it exported, because it had to make up the difference
between a low world price and a high domestic price.
    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade
bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies
might be as high as 100 pct for some products.
    "When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole
country, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with
a grin that they would not tell me," he said.
    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of
the sensitivity of the subject.
    "Unless something is done to change this, China will find
many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from
China," the diplomat added.
    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning
Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.
    "While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign
exchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and
reduce the cost of exports," he said.
    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign
trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT
principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has
said there will be no major price reforms this year following
widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to
stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.
    "So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China
reform its economy?," the diplomat said. "How can it balance the
requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?"
    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the
end outweigh these problems.
    "China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a
part of the world economy," he said.
    "Just as China would get increased access to foreign
markets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic
market to foreign countries."

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by two leading central bankers
sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity."
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

<TITLE>SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
pct.
    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
to grow in 1986.
    Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
West.

<TITLE>RTZ SEES RISING U.S. OUTPUT AIDING 1987 RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
    Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
    The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
    RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
oil prices.
    Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
minerals also aided performance.
    Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The maximum export rebate granted at
yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
Commission sources said.
    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
the sources said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
operators protesting that rebates are too low.
    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange

<TITLE>CBOT SEES YEN BOND FUTURES LISTING IN SIX MONTHS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will
list yen bond futures contracts once the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission gives its approval, which could come within
six months, CBOT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said.
    Mahlmann earlier told a press conference he would visit
Kyoji Kitamura, director-general of the Finance Ministry's
Securities Bureau, to express the CBOT's concern that Japanese
financial institutions and individuals are not permitted to
trade on the CBOT. Mahlmann is on a two-week tour of Hong Kong,
Tokyo and Sydney.
    Mahlmann urged Japan to boost Tokyo's status as a world
financial center by promoting the internationalisation of its
financial industry.
    The Finance Ministry is expected to allow local banks,
securities houses and insurance companies to use overseas
markets from this month, bond market sources said, but
officials would only say the issue was under study.
    Initially, the ministry is likely to bar corporate and
individual investors due to their relative inexperience, and to
limit trading to instruments like currency, stock indexes, time
deposits and government debt futures, the sources said.
    Mahlmann told reporters the CBOT will start evening trading
to coincide with Far East morning activity on April 30. But he
added night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forming
links with Far Eastern exchanges, although nothing had been
decided.
    Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate,
he cited products concerning debt and equity.
    The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M.
Chicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT), which is 8:00 to 11:00 A.M. In
Tokyo, and trading will be limited to four contracts -- U.S.
Treasury note and bond futures and options, he said.
    Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and the
London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE),
combined with yen bond futures listings on both, would multiply
volume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders.
    Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseas
is a prerequisite for expanded futures trading, traders said.
    LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead from
September, possibly coinciding with the CBOT, traders said.
    The CBOT applied for permission to offer a long-term
Japanese government bond futures contract on March 17, and the
authorities must rule on the request within a year.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss
the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in
Washington, government officials said.
    Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to
secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very
seriously, said an official travelling with him.
    Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions
on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up
its markets. The U.S. Has already imposed higher tariffs on
computer microchips imported from Japan.
    Michael Howard, the British minister for consumer and
corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before
leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during
which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese.
    Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union
last week. Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week.

<TITLE>G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
&lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo
said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
Stock Exchange.
    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
from which it was previously exempt.
    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
the tax decision.
    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
in the country.
    In Manila item "Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split"
please read in page 3, first para, "the company's profits are
likely to be substantially cut" (inserting dropped word). This
replaces  "the company's profits are likely to be substantial"

<TITLE>MALAYSIA SEEKS 42 BILLION YEN PIPELINE LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42
billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas
pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said.
    OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told
reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan.
Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve
the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."
    If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four
pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be
disbursed over three years, he added.
    The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the
Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's
national oil company.
    The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and
around the eastern oil town of Kertih.

<TITLE>CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Credit Commercial de France &lt;CCFP.PA>
reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
denationalisation around the end of this month.
    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,

planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
    The sources said it was too early to give details of the
planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
likely date for the flotation launch.
    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
ten shareholders before the flotation.
    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"
CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
at between four and five billion francs.
    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
the same number of investors as &lt;Sogenal>, another recently
privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
    The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also
included the sale of Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere
de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA>. The sale of &lt;Banque du Batiment et des
Travaux Publics> and &lt;Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee>
should be completed this month, while third largest French bank
Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA> will be privatised later this year.

<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Development
Association (IDA) is lending 18.6 mln dlrs to Sri Lanka for
agricultural research and development, the World Bank said in a
statement.
    The loan is part of a 26.5 mln dlr project to improve
production of commodities, mainly rice, and raise farmer
incomes. Other financing for the project will come from Sri
Lanka (7.1 mln dlrs) and West Germany (800,000 dlrs).
    The IDA credit is interest-free and for 50 years. It
includes a 10-year grace period but has annual charges of 0.5
pct on the undisbursed balance, and 0.75 pct on the disbursed
balance, the Bank statement said.
    The project envisages the creation of a Council of
Agricultural Research to formulate a national agricultural
strategy and introduce a contract research programme to finance
research activities, the Bank said.
    The Washington-based IDA is the World Bank's affiliate for
concessionary lending.

<DATELINE>c    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lex Service Plc &lt;LEXL.L> said it had
acquired &lt;Sears Motor Group Ltd>, the retail motor distribution
arm of Sears Plc &lt; SEHL.L>, and an 11.9 mln stg loan note
payable by Sears Motor for 33.4 mln stg.
    The purchase will be through 1.4 mln stg in cash and the
issue to Sears Plc of 8.0 mln new Lex ordinary shares.
    The company said in a statement that immediately following
the acquisition of the motor group, its car and commercial
vehicle contract hire fleet of some 3,000 vehicles was sold to
&lt;Lex Vehicle Leasing Ltd> for 14.3 mln stg in cash, a sum equal
to the net book value of the vehicles transferred.
    Lex Vehicle is owned equally by Lex Services and &lt;Lombard
North Central Plc>.
    Lex said the shares involved in the transaction were today
being placed for Sears Plc with institutions at 400p. These
shares will not qualify for the final Lex dividend on 10 April.
    Lex said in a statement that its acquisition of Sears Motor
Group represents a major development for its automotive
activities. The enlarged retailing operations of the Lex
Automotive group now have a turnover of 530 mln stg. Lex's
existing automotive interests include Volvo Concessionaires,
the sole importer of Volvo cars and parts into the U.K.
    Lex said the turnover for Sears Motor Group in the year to
31 December 1986 was 242 mln stg and that at the date of the
acquisition the group had about 50 mln stg in external
borrowings.
    Lex shares fell on the announcement to trade around 409p
from a 419p close yesterday.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES TO IMPORT CEMENT FROM INDONESIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will import 250,000 bags
of cement worth 375,000 dlrs from Indonesia by the end of the
month to meet growing demand from the construction sector,
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said.
    He told reporters that local cement manufacturers had
stepped up production but were falling short of demand. "The
only solution is to import," he added.
    Concepcion said average monthly requirements of cement in
1986 were 6.7 mln bags while supply hovered around 9.3 mln
bags, but this year demand had grown to 10.4 mln bags per
month.
    Trade and Industry sources said construction sector
representatives estimated an additional 70,000 bags would be
required daily to meet demand.
    Cement is officially priced at 48.50 pesos per bag, but
construction industry sources said it was selling at black
market rates of up to 65 pesos a bag in some areas.
    The sources said falling interest rates as well as a
government budget of four billion pesos in 1987 for low-cost
housing had fuelled a construction boom.

<TITLE>MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to
discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and
ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.
    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the
four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.
    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a
meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not
be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber
exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading
centre.
    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and
contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be
discussed.
    Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries
adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.
The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its
predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing
the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
opened, dealers said.
    Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
    The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
levels reflect economic fundamentals.
    One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.

<TITLE>JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.
    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,
head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "They
see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch
up with them."
    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to
adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital
equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two
countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.
    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little
hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new
regulations governing capital ratios last May.
    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a
capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of
overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for
Japanese banks with overseas branches.
    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's
banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of
Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.
    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have
capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are
well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking
climb of Tokyo share prices.
    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too
high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to
realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell
the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.
    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying
that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show
that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.
    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up
applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial
institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of
their hidden reserves.
    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the
Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks
on the subject.

<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Netherlands' largest insurer
Nationale Nederlanden NV &lt;NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at
least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net
profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in
1985,
    Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders
after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was
raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
corrected on a capital increase.
    The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
Australian dollar and sterling.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
NatNed said.
    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
compared with 52 pct in 1985.
    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln
guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,
tighter interest margins and increased investment.
    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the
previous year.
    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders
in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.
    Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss
the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in
Washington, government officials said.
    Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to
secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very
seriously, said an official travelling with him.
    Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions
on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up
its markets. The U.S. Has already imposed higher tariffs on
computer microchips imported from Japan.
    Michael Howard, the British minister for consumer and
corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before
leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during
which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese.
    Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union
last week. Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
near term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.
    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
should not have produced disappointment.
    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
remedy?" he asked.
    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
support the Paris accord.

<TITLE>GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish drug firm AB Astra &lt;ASTS.ST>
shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading
on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into
anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy
institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic
assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which
was released this week.
    Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month
that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.
    Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough
in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now
discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.
    "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral
research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease,"
the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken &lt;SEBS.ST>, said.
    Company officials could not be reached for comment on the
causes of today's share rise.

<TITLE>EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community launched an
investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
an intensification of world trade strains.
    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
imports into the U.S.
    The EC Executive Commission said today the European
Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
order to compete with the Japanese.
    The Commission said it believed the Association had given
sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
the complaints were justified.
    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
access to the Japanese market.

<TITLE>FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including
an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures."
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

<TITLE>AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

<TITLE>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<TITLE>G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

<TITLE>YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The yen is likely to start another
uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,
currency and bond analysts here said.
    "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said
one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.
    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The
market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."
    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying
bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting
of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
industrialized nations in Washington.
    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a
communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's
view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
should be fostered around these levels.
    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.
    "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line
when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked
Republic's Cohen.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled
speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.
    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
authorities' permissible range.
    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop
up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
intervention and public comments.
    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of
Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade
data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

<TITLE>G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
long term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.

<DATELINE>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Privately-held software
developer SAPC Inc said it has filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Boston against Lotus Development Corp, alleging the
infringement of a copyright and the misappropriation of trade
secrets and is seeking 100 mln dlrs in damages.
    The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program
1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developed
by SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when
the firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts sold
rights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.
    The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor,
who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached a
confidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as a
defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to
VisiCalc before founding Lotus.
    The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately sought
to make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a number
of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.
    Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, which has long
sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
to stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
meetings of leading industrial nations.
    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
foster exchange rate stability.
    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
years.
    Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary
Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the
light of the Japanese announcement.
    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
differences in past meetings.
    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
trade deficit have already taken place.
    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
reafffirmation of Paris.
    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
    The United States and France, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
account balances.
    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
consultations between the countries on whether corrective
action should be required.
    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
relatively free currency markets of recent years.

<TITLE>FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>EC SHELVES LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THREE AIRLINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission said
today it has shelved threatened legal action against West
Germany's Lufthansa &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia of Italy &lt;AERI.MI> and
Olympic Airways of Greece after they agreed to change practices
that restrict competition in the heavily-protected EC sector.
    The Commission had also written to seven other Community
airlines, including British Airways &lt;BAB.L> and Air France,
last summer warning them that agreements such as capacity and
revenue sharing accords broke EC competition rules. The seven
have already agreed to hold talks with the Commission on
bringing such practices into line with the rules.
    In a statement, the EC's executive authority also spelled
out tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks on
liberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares,
warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused to
comply.
    As a first step, the Commission wanted the 10 carriers to
eliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused by
the current practices and agreements.
    The latest demands go further towards liberalisation than
proposals that are currently the subject of difficult
negotiations between by EC Transport Ministers. REUTER

<TITLE>INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's private businessmen say they
have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from
the capital market because government companies are wooing
investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.
    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although
equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms
provide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast
losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth
and income taxes.
    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into
government company bonds because of their tax-free status and
easy transferability.
    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue
equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal
1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public
sector bonds, a merchant banker said.
    They included equity shares and rights issue worth one
billion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata
Fertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed
indefinitely.
    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on the
private sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,
president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry.
    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with
and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise
resources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.
    A senior Finance Ministry official said government and
private firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding
it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were
preventing private firms from raising money on the stock
market.
    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies
still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in
stock exchanges," the ministry official said.
    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani
said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or
about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and
non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.
    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees
mobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,
mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing
their surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.
    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the
bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going
for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a
selective basis," the spokesman said.
    The maturity period of government company bonds varies
between seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are
payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct
interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M
exceeds 7,000 rupees a year.
    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and
12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private
companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from
the tax on income earned from them.
    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on
India's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on
the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can
only be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.
    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in
the stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax
concessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.
    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first
government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion
rupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private
companies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was
oversubscribed three times, brokers said.
    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies
have been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have
sought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming
months.
    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51
billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the
Finance Ministry.
    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees
last year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the
Indian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription
totalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.
    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to
maintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.
    Goenka said that government bonds are making it
increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new
equity or debenture issues. He said the government could at
least "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through
such bonds by the public sector."
    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state
companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial
support to them.
    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has
reduced the budgetary support to development investment in
about 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in
1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures
show.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.

<TITLE>PHYSIO TECHNOLOGY &lt;PHYT> SEES LOSS, IN DEFAULT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOPEKA, Kan., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Physio Technology Inc said it
expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
    The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
    It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
chief executive officer.
    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
    The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
the end of any 30 day period.
    Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
"significantly reduce its fixed overhead."
    Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
affected by the move.
    The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue
to serve as a director, it added.

open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near
yesterday's lows.
    Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker
tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude,
which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below
yesterday's New York close.
    Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April
Brent appears to have ended.
    Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to
open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.
    Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but
said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support
since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off
1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in
thin conditions.

<TITLE>CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is likely to succeed in joining
GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
pct of world trade.
    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
application supported by the United States, Japan and the
European Community for political and economic reasons.
    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
Soviet Union," he said. "China's agreement will be seen as a
model for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body."
    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
and often contain subsidies.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association is expected to report the sixth straight increase
in its three-month average book-to-bill ratio, reflecting a
continued modest recovery in the computer chip industry,
semiconductor analysts said.
    Semiconductor analysts contacted by Reuters put the March
book-to-bill -- which is the ratio of new orders to actual
sales -- at around 1.15, up from a preliminary 1.13 in the
three months ended in February. The association is expected to
release its estimates later today or on friday.
    The analysts said they expect strong March performance both
in new orders and actual sales.
    Michael Gumport, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc,
projected the three-month average of new computer chip orders
at about 835 mln dlrs, up from 788 mln dlrs in February.
    He put three-month average sales at about 720 mln dlrs,
also an increase from the 700 mln dlrs reported last month.
    Gumport said average new orders over 850 mln dlrs would be
a plus for semiconductor industry stocks, while orders under
800 would be interpreted negatively on Wall Street.
    Gumport said cut backs in Japanese computer chip production
are aiding U.S. chip maker orders and sales.
    Edward White, analyst with E.F. Hutton Group Inc, said
while Japanese cut backs may be a small factor, their effect
should be more readily apparant in April and May.
    White, who put the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.15-1.16,
said the ratio might hit 1.20 later this spring, before showing
a normal seasonal decline during the summer.
    He forecast three-month average orders at 825 mln dlrs for
March, with three-month average billings at about 711 mln dlrs.
    "This says the industry is still in a phase of moderate
recovery...it is not dramatic yet," said White.
    He said the industry still has not seen a pick-up in high
technology capital spending needed to create a strong recovery.
    He said a boost in spending on such big-ticket items as
mainframe computers would enhance the recovery, which is now
focused on personal and small business computers.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak agreed the
industry is showing a recovery trend, that while encouraging,
is not dramatic.
    Kubiak projected the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.14. He
said the three-month average for orders will be up about 4.5
pct from last month, while shipments rise about one pct.
    He noted, however, orders during the month of March alone,
a statistic the Semiconductor Industry Association does not
publish, should show a 15-20 pct rise from February orders.
    Kubiak said a book to bill ratio of 1.14 would have little
or no effect on semincondutor industry stocks, while a ratio of
1.13 would be negative for the market and a ratio of 1.16 would
likely cause the stocks to rise.

<TITLE>LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moderately active grain fixing was
reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
said.
    A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
dlrs.
    Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
    Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
was obtainable.
    On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
paid 22 dlrs.
    Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.

<TITLE>EUROCHEQUE EXPECTS AROUND 10 PCT CARD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The number of cards in the Eurocheque
system, Europe's biggest personal payments system, grew by 11
pct to 39.1 mln last year and is expected to continue
increasing by around 10 pct in coming years, Eurocheque
International Secretary General Mark Van Wauve said.
    He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be used
in 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurocheques
written in local currency and, where facilities are available,
as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000
automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed to
have 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.
    Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.
    Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already accept
Eurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issue
Eurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible these
would be launched in Italy this year if the Rome government
agreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writing
cheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.
    Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-based
coordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from the
Soviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.
    Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them to
charge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and Van
Wauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded such
commissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.
    Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency for
goods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28
countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the system
this year. East Germany last year became the 40th country to
accept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.
    Eurocheque International estimated the total of Eurocheques
used nationally and internationally at over one billion a year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    "Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded," he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable."
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

    It said Bank President Barber Conable at a meeting with Sri

economy, battered by five years of separatist disturbances.
    Officials said Sri Lanka's budget deficit this year is
expected to surpass the projected 28.7 billion rupees while
defence spending, already up by two billion rupees from a
targetted 10 billion, is also likely grow.
    The Ministry said de Mel asked the World Bank to give Sri
Lanka 6.5 billion rupees balance of payments support.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, which has long
sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
to stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.
    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
meetings of leading industrial nations.
    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
foster exchange rate stability.
    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
differences in past meetings.
    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
trade deficit have already taken place.
    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
reafffirmation of Paris.
    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
    The United States and France, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
account balances.
    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
consultations between the countries on whether corrective
action should be required.
    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
relatively free currency markets of recent years.

<TITLE>GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The global economy is expected to
weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
additional concern.
    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
pct from 3.5 pct last year.
    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
with growing mounds of debt.
    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
states for markets for their products as well as financial
assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
economies poses fundamental worries.
    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
including the key one of exports.
    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
slower than expected.
    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has
to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
to get a resonably complete effect."
    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
more time on this occasion."

<TITLE>SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The head of Spain's employers'
federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
about the government's monetary policies because high real
interest rates were hampering investment.
    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
11.8 at end-1986.
    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
pct wage ceiling.
    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
increase over the corresponding period last year.
    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
peseta to correct the imbalance.

<TITLE>LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Bradshaw, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lead prices have risen this week against
a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
said.
    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying
or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.
    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at
a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
prices tending to drift lower.
    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
said.
    The lower supply levels result from a number of different
factors around the globe.
    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries
because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish
exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at
Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant
additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
been drawing on LME stocks.
    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,
South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet
commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks
and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
a regular supplier to the world market.
    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,
have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported
in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the
first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
order was filled by merchants in March.
    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices
this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in
Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often
a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.
    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp
and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
and this is believed to be in strong hands.
    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest
level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses
which are not popular with merchants putting together
shipments.
    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to
secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
the transport of used batteries.
    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important
part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,
Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.
    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of
strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting
speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at
midsession.

Tuesday to discuss measures to cover the state Social Security
Fund's deficit before the summer, Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac's social affairs adviser, Marie-Helene Berard, said.
    Employment Ministry officials say the fund, in surplus
until 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of this
year, largely because of rising unemployment. Budget Minister
Alain Juppe said the fund needed more resources and a
management overhaul. The government was not in favour of
introducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the 
previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, he
said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc said the tender
offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for
Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday
without the purchase of any Purolator common stock.
    Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger
agreement with Purolator.
    Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the
tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about
two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because
the minimum number of shares was not tendered.
    Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC
Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.
Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division,
in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common
stock shares for 35 dlrs a share.
    Following that move, PC Acquisition planned to merge a
subsidiary into Purolator, converting all outstanding Purolator
common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal
amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to
purchase 15 pct of a Purolator unit comprised of Purolator's
U.S courier operations.
    Hutton said as of 2400 EDT yesterday about 181,000 shares
of Purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding
shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.
    PC Acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer
to return promptly the Purolator stock deposited by, or on
behalf of, tendering shareholders, Hutton said.

<TITLE>INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's national foodgrain target has
been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
annual report for 1986/87.
    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
sub-divisions of the country.
    The report gave the targets for various crops with
estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
mln.
   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
development plan ending March 31, 1990.
    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
good weather, the report said.
    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
vigrously pursued," it said.

<TITLE>REICHHOLD CHEMICAL &lt;RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WHITE PLAINS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.
    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,
1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.
    Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
to stockholders.

January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank
of Spain figures show.
    Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared
with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil
imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159
mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
    Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with
February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last
February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.
    Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with
1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large
ammount of investment goods entering the country with the
recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
    Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655
mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and
502 mln dlrs in February last year.

<TITLE>UK, FRANCE TO URGE DEBT RELIEF FOR POOREST LANDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain, France and other European
nations will make a strong plea in high-level meetings today
for urgent debt relief for the very poorest countries, European
monetary sources said.
    The request will be put to the International Monetary
Fund's policy-making Interim Committee, which meets here as
part of semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.
    But it is likely to run into opposition from the United
States, which regards debt relief, even for the world's poorest
nations in Sub-Saharan Africa, with distaste.
    "If all creditors agreed, (Britain and France) would be
prepared to consider below market interest rates " for the
countries, one source said.
    A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on the
plan earlier this week, however. "We are not willing to enter
into arrangements that would forgive debt or provide
concessional interest rates," the official said.
    At the heart of the American objection is the fear that
once such a concession is made for the very poorest nations,
then sooner or later Latin debtors will be demanding similar
relief.
    African nations owe foreign creditors, most of them
governments, over 70 billion dlrs. Over 21 billion dlrs is debt
owed by poorest Sub-Saharan African nations.
    In addition to interest rate concessions, the sources said
European countries wanted repayment of these loans to be
stretched out for up to 20 years, with a substantial delay
before capital repayments start.
    The issue was inconclusively discussed in yesterday's
meetings of the major industrial nations -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    It is already under consideration by the Paris Club of
western creditor nations, to which the United States belongs.
    "There are quite obviously differences about it," one source
said of the American attitude. "But it is perfectly clear that
(debt repayment) is an abiding problem for a small number of
the poorest countries."
    The plan would also involve the conversion of bilateral aid
to these countries into outright grants, a policy already
adopted by Paris and London.

<TITLE>VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Losses for Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp, the parent of American
Airlines, rose sharply in active trading after analyst Roland
Moreno of Smith Barney upgraded his opinion of the stock to buy
from accumulate and added it to the brokerage house's
recommended list, traders said.
    AMR climbed 1-3/8 to 55-5/8.
    A spokeswoman for Smith Barney said the recommendation was
made because the airline group looks cheap relative to the
broad market and the analyst feels AMR is the best in the
group.
    In a related action, Moreno downgraded his opinion of UAL
Inc &lt;UAL> to accumulate from buy and took it off the firm's
recommended list, Smith Barney's spokeswoman said. The stock
slipped 1/2 to 71-1/2 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    She said the Moreno's downgrade of UAL was because the
"stock had risen to a level beyond what current fundamentals
can support." The stock has risen more on merger speculation
than on fundamentals, the opinion continued.
    In recent weeks, rumors UAL stock was being accumulated for
a possible takeover bid shored up the stock, traders and
analysts said. In addition, pilots of UAL's United Airlines
unit proposed a buyout of the airline for 4.5 billion dlrs.
    The Smith Barney spokeswoman said the postive
recommendation of AMR emphasizes the company's strong marketing
ability, its good management and customer loyalty to the AMR
name. She said the company has been the best financial
performer of the airline group.
    The AMR recommendation includes earnings expectations of
4.35 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to earnings of 4.63 dlrs
a share last year, the spokeswoman said. In 1988, the company
is expected to earn six dlrs a share.
    Traders said other airline stocks moved higher today
primarily as a result of fare hikes announced Wednesday by
Texas Air &lt;TEX>, United Airlines and AMR.
    Delta &lt;DAL> rose 1/2 to 56-7/8, NWA Inc &lt;NWA> 3/8 to 66,
and Pan Am &lt;PN> 1/8 to 4-5/8.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Computer Systems Inc
expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
revenues."
    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
discontinuance of products last year.
    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
shares outstanding.
    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

<TITLE>FED MAY ADD RESERVES TO BANKING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve may intervene in
the government securities market to supply temporary reserves
indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.
    They said that while the Fed faces no great urgency to add
reserves at the start of the two-week maintenance period today
it would probably do so in order to offset a relatively high
federal funds rate.
    Fed funds opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained there in early
trading. Yesterday, they averaged 6.45 pct, after rising as
high as seven pct at the close.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
necessary."
    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
speech to the British Parliament.
    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
still a risk," he said.
    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a
need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
be a rise in interest rates in the United States."
    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
reducing its budget deficit.
    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
continue year after year," Lawson said.
    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been
no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
... but one has to be vigilant."
    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the
same thing," he said.
    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
weakness for that agreement.
    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
domestic demand.
    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
the second half of this year.

<TITLE>U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading on the London potato futures
market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the
London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement
to floor members.
    It was in response to strong representations by the Potato
Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of
price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
physical market when the April futures position expires.
    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures
trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the
relationship between futures and physicals.
    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations
by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the
International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other
parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
    The main complaint from some sections of the physical
market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this
morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's
average price of 104 stg.
    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is
a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality
potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser
quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
against the April futures contract between now and the end of
the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management
committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

    Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May

offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined
to end April metal at 4,225 stg.
    Small-scale spot business was reported by West German

<TITLE>DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar drifted down to end one
pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
attempts to push it lower through the day.
    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
as "soft as wax."
    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
current reason to change monetary course at present.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may be under consideration.
    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
pct after 3.80 yesterday.
    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
runup recently, still present some short term investment
opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
soon. They recommend taking profits.
    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said
Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be
strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
(order rates) are starting to dive already."
    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel
Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.
    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
make them more efficient.
    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
they've come a long way," he said.
    "We think the stock will do moderately better than the
market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
against losses last year.
    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
said.
    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy
on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
it," he said.
    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot
depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
come from oil and natural gas.
    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot
(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
for," she said.
    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
1986.
    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
been recommending the stocks since last November.
    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
third quarter.
    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)
prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"
he said.
    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than
negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
a field report.
    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
affected quality, the report said.
    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, APRIL 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
boost world prices, trade sources said.
    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
    The traders were responding to questions whether they would
follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
criteria.
    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been
orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.
    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong
domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
fall.
    "We should pay particular attention to the lack of
continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

    Iraq said today it repelled an Iranian assault near its
southern port of Basra last night, inflicting thousands of
casualties on the attackers.
    An Iraqi field commander told a correspondent of the
official Iraqi news agency INA that four Iranian divisions were
destroyed in the fighting. He said "Our forces are still engaged
in repelling the enemy offensive, inflicting on them intensive
losses, but (they are) in full control of the situation."
    A Baghdad war communique last night said Iraq had foiled a
three-pronged thrust some 10 km from Basra while admitting Iran
had occupied some fresh territory.

    "We believe that significant increases in taxes would not

Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.
    He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of
gradually reducing deficits through restraining government
spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting
the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.

<TITLE>JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cutthroat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.
    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,
head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "They
see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch
up with them."
    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to
adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital
equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two
countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.
    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little
hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new
regulations governing capital ratios last May.
    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a
capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of
overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for
Japanese banks with overseas branches.
    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's
banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of
Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.
    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have
capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are
well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking
climb of Tokyo share prices.
    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too
high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to
realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell
the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.
    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying
that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show
that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.
    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up
applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial
institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of
their hidden reserves.
    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the
Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks
on the subject.

<TITLE>NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    "I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LLOYD'S OFFERS CASH IN BID TO END PCW AFFAIR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyd's of London has offered to meet
part of the 235 mln stg in claims that investors in PCW
Underwriting Agencies face due to fraud and mismanagement,
chairman Peter Miller said at a press conference.
    Miller urged 3,000 PCW members to accept the offer so that
the five-year-old affair could be closed.
    The members have until May 30 to accept the offer,
involving a 103 mln stg payment by Lloyd's and some of Lloyd's
underwriters in exchange for a 34 mln stg contribution from PCW
members, he said.
    Miller said that at end-1985, PCW syndicates had gross
liabilities of 680 mln stg.
    To offset this, they had assets, including cash and
payments from reinsurance policies on some of the risks
underwritten by the syndicates, of 445 mln stg, leaving net
liabilities of 235 mln, he said.
    The total sum on offer, including a 48 mln stg payment from
Lloyd's 311 mln stg contingency fund and 55 mln stg from
Lloyd's brokers who could otherwise face court cases for their
involvement in PCW, is designed to cover the full reinsurance
cost for those 235 mln stg of net liabilities, Miller said.
    Under the offer, which requires 90 pct acceptance, Lloyd's
itself would take over all members' future obligations
connected with the PCW syndicates, Miller said. Members would
have to agree not to pursue the matter in court.
    Miller said a rejection of the offer would probably lead to
protracted litigation in court which, even if succesful for
members, was unlikely to produce a better deal for them.
    He added that acceptance would mean members could continue
underwriting in the Lloyd's market and qualify for tax relief
on the cash payments they would make towards the settlement.
    Miller denied that PCW members would face bills of over
200,000 stg.
    He said only 34 members would be asked to pay between
100,000 and 200,000 stg, and about 100 between 60,000 and
100,000 stg. Special arrangements would be sought for those who
accept the offer but are unable to pay.
    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's accepted
responsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of
1982 when "it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) Peter
Cameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetrated
theft upon members," he said.
    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered and
repaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairs
of PCW syndicates "in a state of chaos which led to a sharp
deterioration of their underwriting results," Miller said. Both
were fined by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee and expelled
from membership.
    He said Lloyd's would continue to seek reparation in
British and U.S. Courts "with the utmost vigour ... To bring to
a close one of the most shameful episodes in the history of
Lloyd's," and was contemplating claiming the full amount of the
settlement now on offer from Cameron Webb and Dixon.
    In a reaction, insurance brokerage Sedgwick Group Plc
&lt;SDWK.L> said it supported Lloyd's proposals and had
contributed 10 mln stg towards the proposed settlement.
    It said in a statement, "as largest broker in the Lloyd's
market, the company has an essential interest in maintaining
the reputation of the market. That reputation has been damaged
by problems at PCW and will continue to be so as long as they
remain unresolved." It had contributed to the proposed
settlement to avoid costs related to the defence of some of its
subsidiaries which had been named as potential defendants to
litigation by PCW members, it said.

signed franchise agreements with banks in Louisiana and
Washington D.C.
    The banks, Citizens Bank and Trust Co of Thibodaux,
Louisiana and National Enterprise Bank of Washington, will
change their names to First Interstate this summer.
    Citizens Bank has assets of 267 mln dlrs in eight offices.
National Enterprise has 53 mln dlrs in assets in one office.
    Under its franchise system, member banks offer a variety of
First Interstate financial services, but are not owned by First
Interstate.
    First Interstate operates 24 banks in 12 states, but its
franchise operation extends the geographic area through its
affiliate banks to 19 states, plus the District of Columbia.
    First Interstate, the nation's ninth largest bank, has 42
banks with 138 offices under its franchise system.
    Today's move is its first into the east coast and southern
portion of the nation. Most of its other franchise system banks
are located in the western region.
    First Interstate Chairman Joseph Pinola told Reuters in a
recent interview the lagging agricultural economy in the
Midwest continues to inhibit expansion into that region.

    "They don't ask the question, 'Is it right or is it wrong?'
They ask the question, 'Can you pull it off?'" Rep Edward Markey
(D-Mass) told a state securities administrators meeting here.
    Markey, Chairman of the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee which oversees U.S. securities markets,
said this ethic permeated Wall Street as well as the Reagan
administration.
    He cited as examples a number of administration officials
tainted by charges of wrongdoing including ex-Reagan advisor
Michael Deaver, former national security aide John Poindexter
and former Environmental Protection Agency official Rita
Lavelle.
    Some Wall Street critics have blamed the insider trading
scandal on the so-called "Yuppie mentality", in which young
professionals strive for financial reward and neglect social
values.
    But Markey said the inspiration for this attitude came from
the administration.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Based on field travel in the
Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
    It said generally favorable weather from early December
through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
report said.
    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
serious storage problems, the report said.
    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
expected to be above average, it said.
    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
crop has been harvested.
    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
report said.
    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
for the decline are expected reduced government support price
and good summer crop harvests.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia has secured total borrowings
this year for 1.95 billion dlrs, of which 1.40 billion
correspond to loans arranged before 1986, Director of Public
Credit Mauricio Cabrera said.
    Cabrera said about half of the borrowings would come from
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
    He was speaking at a forum for industrialists upon his
return from London where he attended the signing of a 50 mln
dlr floating rate note, Colombia's first such offering on the
euromarket.
    Cabrera reaffirmed that Colombia has no intention of
rescheduling  its foreign debt, which he put at 14.35 billion
dlrs, of which 11.35 billion are from the public sector.
    For the international banking community, Colombia continues
to be "the best house in spite of being in the worst
neighbourhood," he said.
    He said debt servicing will remain a burden in 1987 and
will amount to 34.6 pct of total exports.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve was detected buying
dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a
40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading,
currency dealers said.
     They said the size of the intervention was relatively
modest so far but it was a clear indication that the U.S.
remained committed to the late February Paris currency
stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in Washington last
night.
    A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.
    The dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.

served notice that they would block a move in the
U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions against South Africa
in a bid to end its rule of Namibia (South West Africa).
    Their vetoes would repeat the joint action they took on
February 20 to bar selective sanctions against Pretoria over
its apartheid policy.
    "Measures of this sort would be counterproductive, giving
South Africa the excuse to remain intransigent," John Birch, the
British delegate, said. Vernon Walters, the U.S.
representative, said Washington flatly opposed mandatory
sanctions.

the bulk carrier Mykon Wave will be able to continue using
temporary arrangements, Tate and Lyle said.
    The Mykon Wave arrived in the port recently with about
18,300 tonnes of bulk sugar from Maputo in Swaziland. About
1,600 tonnes remain to be discharged.
    Five other ships loaded with raw sugar are awaiting at
Silvertown to be discharged, Tate and Lyle added.

    The company said the plan, originally adopted February 18,

    GenCorp said the rights plan makes it more difficult for an
outside company or person to takeover the company. The plan has
been extended indefinitely and to no person acquiring 20 pct or
more of the common stock prior to April 13, the company said.
    The plan calls for the attachment of one preferred stock
purchase right to each common share outstanding.
   On Monday, GenCorp announced it will buy up to 54 pct of its
own outstanding common shares for 130 dlrs per share. It said
details of the plan will be announced by the end of the week.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, said
he introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes on
beer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.
    His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27
dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents per
six pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17
cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs per
gallon respectively, he said in a statement.
    "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirely
justifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would also
modestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Corp's G.D. Searle and Co unit
said it will report an operating loss for 1987, mainly due to
expenses for research and development.
    Searle chairman Sheldon Gilgore said Searle's operating
loss in 1987 will be less than the 87 mln dlr operating loss in
1986.
    He said Searle's first quarter sales will be up 21.8 pct to
179 mln dlrs from 147 mln dlrs in the year ago quarter. In 1986
Searle's sales were 665 mln dlrs.
    Gilgore said the company intends to have sales of three
billion dlrs by the mid-1990s.
    He said the company anticipates approval in Japan, the
U.S., Italy, Spain and the U.K. for its ulcer treatment drug
Cytotech.
    He also said that in a paper not yet published the drug was
shown to prevent a flare-up of ulcers for a longer period of
time than Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beckman Corp &lt;SKB>.
    Other drugs in Searle's pipeline include tissue plasminogen
activator (TPA), made by a different process than Genentech's
&lt;GENE> TPA, expected to be approved for marketing this year.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN AIRLINES REPORT RECORD PASSENGER RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European airlines, hit by a drop in
business across the North Atlantic for much of last year, today
reported record passenger traffic for February.
    The 21-member Association of European Airlines said
passenger traffic in February was 11 pct higher than a year
earlier, allowing carriers to fill just under 60 pct of seat
capacity, the highest ever recorded in the month.
    On the North Atlantic route, where 1986 business suffered
because American visitors were deterred by the falling dollar,
fears of terrorism and the Chernobyl nuclear accident,
passenger traffic was up 15.5 pct.
    Improvements were also registered on South and
Mid-Atlantic, European, Asian and Middle East routes.
    "If the momentum is maintained AEA airlines can anticipate
sustained growth this summer -- in marked contrast to last
year," Henderson said in a statement.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States will push for a
strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June
economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations
on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm
subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.
    "Agriculture has really become the number one international
economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.
    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders
identified agriculture as a major international problem but
made no specific recommendations.
    This year, Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statement
instructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue,
and include domestic programs.
    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will
not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a
push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"
negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic
policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission was authorised
to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
in the second half of June, although sales into intervention
normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
    They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC
and the United States.
    The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
    The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
    They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
    They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April
30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
implementation of the accord with the United States.

<TITLE>CORROON/BLACK &lt;CBL> SAYS UNIT IN LLOYD'S FUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corroon and Black Corp said &lt;Minet
Holdings PLC>, of which it owns 25 pct, agreed to participate
in a 103 mln stg fund set up by Lloyd's of London to cover part
of the claims faced by PCW underwriting agencies.
    The company said Minet and several other companies were
involved in the syndicate, which faces 235 mln stg in claims
due to fraud and mismanagement.
    The fund was proposed by Lloyd's to cover a portion of the
claims in return for a contribution of 34 mln stg from PCW
members. The offer is subject to acceptance by 90 pct of the
PCW members by May 30.
    Lloyd's 103 mln stg offer, including 48 mln stg from
Lloyd's and 55 mln stg from brokers, is designed to cover the
reinsurance costs on the 235 mln stg of net liabilities.
    Minet was unable to disclose the amount of its proposed
contribution to the fund, Caroon and Black said. However, Minet
was confident that the losses could be funded from existing
cash resources.
    Under the terms proposed, Lloyd's would take over all
members' future obligations connected with PCW, and members
would agree not to pursue the matter in court.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The consumption of some base metals,
along with dollar prices, are showing signs of modest
improvement, according to Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc (RTZ).
    However, the company said, iron ore markets have weakened.
    RTZ commodity specialist Philip Crowson told reporters he
thought base metals industry forecasts for 1987 were erring on
the side of caution, whereas forecasts for the last several
years had proven over-optimistic.
    RTZ said it expected to benefit from a rise in U.S. And
industrial production in 1987. Earlier, RTZ reported 1986 net
attributable profit of 245 mln stg against 257 mln in 1985.

    The targets, three buildings on the outskirts of Ain

    Holders of fewer than 455 Southmark shares who would
receive rights to acquire fewer than 100 American Realty shares

    In order to get the dividend for these rights a Southmark
shareholder must own common stock on the ex-dividend date,
April 27, the company said.
    After that, Southmark said its common stock will be traded
on an ex-rights basis.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States will push for a
strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June
economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations
on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm
subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.
    "Agriculture has really become the number one international
economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.
    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders
identified agriculture as a major international problem but
made no specific recommendations. This year, Wallis said the
U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to
begin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.
    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will
not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a
push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"
negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic
policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.
    "They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic
policies, as well as trade arrangements," Wallis said.
    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit
statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an
overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm
talks.
    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the
Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.
    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will
repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting
next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda
of the trade ministers "quadrilateral" talks among
Japan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.
    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will
highlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.
    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic
farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies
among industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous
in the EC and United States.
    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which
allows farm aid to be compared across countries.
    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister
Michael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method
of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.
    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE
can be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and "its not
definitive."
    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration
has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture
proposal to present to the GATT.
    "I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,"
after the series of international meetings, Wallis said.
    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,
the United States has pushed for the so-called "freeze and
rollback" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current
levels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.
    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade
analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian
prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke
unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce
the gap between high farm price supports and world prices.
    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13
coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.
    "The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming
up with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is
not what we think is what's called for here," Wallis said.
    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a "long-range"
solution to the agriculture problem.
    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal
because they said it deals primarily with the difference
between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,
but fails to focus on the question of market access.
    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian
"quick fix", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for
a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed
"expeditiously", or within two years.
    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep
the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement
program and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a
sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.

<TITLE>U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
recovery in April.
    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
weeks later than last year.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
5.7 pct last year.
    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
holiday nears.
    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
sportswear were also excellent.
    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
    J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
southwest."
    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
Stearns.
    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
than last year.
    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
the year.
    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
May.

<TITLE>LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
pct.
    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
in aftermarket activity.
    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
currently associated with owning dollar securities.
    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
at less 1.75 less 1.55.
    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
144 yen.
    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

<TITLE>LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reducing the amount of crop base a
farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as
one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year
1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the
planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be
reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.
    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,
but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture
spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be
discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.
    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage
base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would
receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.
    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency
payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.
    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400
to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop
programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year
1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.
    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially
offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget
reconciliation bill.
    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut
one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing
acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,
implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the
use of generic in-kind certificates.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northern Trust Corp said its first
quarter earnings were reduced by 875,000 dlrs by placing 53.2
mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and six mln dlrs in loans to
Ecuador on a cash basis.
    Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the
rest of 1987, net income for year will be cut by about 3.2 mln
dlrs, the bank said.
    Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln
dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a
share.
    Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,
up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March
31, 1986 the bank said.
    The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct
of outstanding loans, higher than the 56 mln dlrs of 1.65 pct
of loans outstanding at March 31, 1986.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR MORE TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A further cut in West German taxes to
overcome the current weakness of the domestic economy has been
called for by Thomas Wegscheider, management board chairman of
Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG.
    He said in  an interview due in tomorrow's Die Welt
newspaper that tax cuts already decided by the government
should be expanded by implementation of the "Stability Law,"
which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.
    Wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowing
resulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according to
excerpts of his remarks released early by Die Welt.
    In line with a pledge made at the Paris monetary conference
in February, the government announced in March that 5.2 billion
marks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of some
nine billion marks already scheduled for next year.
    Wegscheider said the Bundesbank should pursue its policies
aimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in money
market rates could encourage private capital market investment.
    Earlier today the Bundesbank's vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason to
change its monetary course.

<TITLE>SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Conradi</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must
be provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference
in information requirements between notes and public bonds,
according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.
    The convention requires that lead managers draw up a
prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain
details about the borrower.
    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must
merely be made available to clients on request via all
syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in
printed form.
    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this
month, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and
deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly
anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.
    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the
amount of information that should be provided by borrowers,
heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on
recent occasions .
    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss
francs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with
customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.
    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the
unchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.
    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage
that the new requirement would present them with problems or
push up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been
providing more than the legal minimum of information.
    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were
also known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000
francs and placed largely with institutional investors.
    They were normally not brought onto the open market and
never quoted on the stock exchange.
    But over the years the distinction between notes and the
publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The
National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining
restrictions on maturities and denominations which still
formally divided them.
    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank
to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely
as before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,
have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,
virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with
"information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.
    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says
each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:
    - The precise terms of the issue
    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six
months since the last annual report
    - Naming of all guarantors
    - The source of the information
    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made
    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's
shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the
last three years.
    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to
provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the
progress of his business.
     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note
issues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs
last year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the
form of public bonds.
    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.

<TITLE>BRAZIL GOVERNORS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF FUNARO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's political crisis appears
to be deepening as powerful state governors are calling for the
removal of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of
economic policy.
    Commentators said their call, front-page headlines in
today's press, laid bare President Jose Sarney's political
weakness and highlighted Brazil's economic planning turmoil.
    The demand for Funaro's resignation came last night from
four governors with much combined political clout, those of Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. At
a news conference in Sao Paulo, they delivered a blunt message
-- the economy was in crisis and they wanted a new ministerial
team to shape policy. Otherwise there was a risk of social
chaos.

<TITLE>SONY CHAIRMAN PLAYS DOWN TRADE CONFLICT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLMAR, France, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio
Morita played down the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict, saying
that direct investment abroad was the most effective way to
reduce Japan's trade surplus.
    Morita was speaking at the official opening of a 100
million franc (16.4 million dollars) compact disc player
factory in eastern France.
    He said trade friction between the U.S. And Japan over
high-technology was a very complicated and delicate issue but
that Sony intended to invest directly throughout the world.
    Referring to the European Community's stance against
turnkey plants, he said: "I know Brussels is not very favourable
to these so-called new Japanese 'screwdriver factories', but in
Sony's case our policy is quite different."
    The Colmar plant, Sony's third in France, would eventually
use local components and be a purely French factory, he said.
     Sony France SA was established in 1973. Its 1986 sales
were two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says it
expects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987.
Sony's other two French plants, in the south west of the
country, export over 80 per cent of their production.
    Company officials say that production from Sony's European
factories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of the
group's European sales and they expect this to increase. In
1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwide
sales were made in Europe.
    At the beginning of 1987, Sony employed about 1,100 people
in Europe. The group plans to open a compact disc software
factory in Austria this summer and an audio cassette plant in
Italy next year.

<TITLE>UGANDAN ASKS FOR MORE MONEY TO KEEP up SERVICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ugandan Finance Minister Chrispus
Kiyonga has asked the National Resistance Council, the
country's interim parliament, to approve 1,000 billion
shillings (714 mln dlrs) in extra government spending over the
last three months of this financial year, council sources said.
    Kiyonga told the council that because of high inflation,
estimated to be running at over 150 per cent a year, the
government needed extra money to keep its services running
until the financial year ends on June 30.
    The new appropriation requested by the minister is almost
as much as the 1,127 billion shillings (805 mln dlrs) the
government expected to spend during the whole year.
    Kiyonga said the government was having trouble keeping to
the deficit target of 350 billion shillings (250 mln dlrs)
contained in the original budget announced last August. The
deficit was to be financed by borrowing.
    The minister did not give a new budget deficit estimate.

measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion
francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the
goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.
    The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion
francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose
slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.
    Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher
deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.

<TITLE>WARD CRITICISES GUINNESS'S FEE COMPLAINT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> director Thomas
Ward told a High Court hearing that the company's action
against him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give the
impression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg fee
in connection with the Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> takeover, the
Press Association news agency reported.
    In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinness
had failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March had
offered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, into
an escrow account where it could only be touched under agreed
circumstances.
    Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt to
belittle his services, the PA reported.
    "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was,
when considered out of context, admittedly very large."
    But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of the
target, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potential
damage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised and
the cost for all services - were not merely large but virtually
unprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.
    Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100
mln stg, he added.
    Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement with
Distillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bid
costs, the PA reported.
    Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer Peter
Curry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end a
temporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputed
amount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying to
recover.
    Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7
billion stg battle during 1986. The U.K. Government is also
probing the affair and has yet to report.

<TITLE>MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of prime minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned
his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.
    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidate
in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several
conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry
against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.
    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down
before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10
if the LDP lost too many major local seats.
    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his
party to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and
analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.
    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of
polling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.
    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the
governorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre
parties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,
who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist
parties.
    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.
    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about
1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the
incumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,
professor of political science at Dokkyo University.
    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if
the LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.
    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the
governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.
    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei
University, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if
the LDP loses only in Hokkaido."
    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales
tax proposal.
    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to
overhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36
years.
    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese
domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax
revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating
the economy.

<TITLE>DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
revenue.
    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.
     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the
seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be
identified.
    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States said a new attack
by Iran in the Gulf war against Iraq does not appear to be a
major offensive.
    "We don't believe that what has been called Karbala-8 is a
major offensive," State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said.
    He was responding to Iran's announcement that it had
launched its second offensive in three days against Iraq.
    Karbala-8 is the code name for the attack in which both
sides have reported heavy fighting on the southern front near
the major Iraqi port of Basra.
    Redman said the offensive "appears to have been an Iran
attack which has not made much of an advance."
    Detailed information is lacking, he said, "but this seems
to be largely a repetition of the kind of fighting we had seen
previously in the same area east of Basra."
    Redman restated the U.S. call for an immediate end to
hostilities and said Washington "deplored the loss of life in
this tragic war."

in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a

    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
last month.
    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

last week to a total of 752, against 987 working rigs one year
ago, Hughes Tool Co said.
    In Canada, the rig count continued falling last week
because of the government's annual springtime ban prohibiting
heavy equipment from being transported over rain-softened
highways. A total of 85 rigs were working in Canada, down 46
from the previous week, Hughes said. At this time last year, a
total of 109 rigs were working in Canada.
    Among individual states, Louisiana and New Mexico each
reported drilling declines of 10 rigs and Kansas was down by
seven. Gains were reported in Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas which
increased by 20, seven and one, respectively.
    Hughes said the total of 752 working rigs in the United
States included 17 in inland waters, 74 in offshore waters and
661 on land.

<TITLE>ITALIAN TREASURY BILL OFFER MEETS MIXED DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Market response to the Italian Treasury's
3,000 billion lire offer of short-term bills (BOTs) was mixed,
with six month paper oversubscribed but 12-month bills little
in demand, Bank of Italy figures show.
    Rates were unchanged on those indicated at the time the
offer was announced on April 4.
    The market was assigned all the 1,500 billion lire worth of
six-month bills on offer after requesting a total of 1,660
billion. Effective net annualized compound yield on the bills
is 9.19 pct, against 9.24 pct at the end-March auction.
    Of the 1,500 billion lire of 12-month paper offered,
operators requested and were assigned 911.975 billion lire at a
net annualized compound rate of 9.02 pct.
    The Bank of Italy took up the remaining 588.025 billion
lire of 12-month paper.
    The bills replace maturing paper worth 2,485 billion lire
of which 1,985 billion was in the hands of market operators and
the remainder with the Bank of Italy.

heavy trading in UAL Inc, traders said.
    UAL rose 1-5/8 to 73-5/8 on volume of more than two mln
shares, after trading with little upward movement earlier in
the session.
    Traders said rumors, which began yesterday, added to
speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover.
    They said it was believed Coniston Partners and the
Pritzker family of Chicago were buying the stock.
    Coniston declined comment and the Pritzkers had no comment.
    Traders said there was speculation a bidder might appear,
and also that real estate developer Donald Trump, who holds a
stake in UAL, might participate in a takeover bid. UAL pilots
said they would be willing to pay 4.5 billion dlrs, which
includes debt, for the company's United Airlines unit.

<TITLE>GREYCOAT GROUP SEEKS TWO FINANCINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Property company Greycoat Group Plc
is seeking two financings, one for 120 mln stg and the other
for 16 mln stg, in connection with its Embankment Place
development above and around Charing Cross station in London,
banking sources said.
    The first transaction, a 120 mln stg credit, will be
arranged by N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd and Bank of Tokyo
International Ltd on behalf of a special purpose Greycoat
subsidiary yet to be incorporated.
    It matures in June 1993 but will be extendible by up to two
years to June 1995 at the option of the borrower.
    The first credit, a project financing, will carry a basic
margin of 5/8 point over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR), with an additional 1/4 pct per annum payable on
outstanding amounts to the extent that the property is not
substantially pre-let.
    In addition, if the property is pre-sold while amounts are
still outstanding, the basic margin will be reduced to 1/2
point over LIBOR, the banking sources said.
    For a one year extension of the maturity an extra 1/8 point
margin will be paid, with a further 1/8 point if the maturity
is lengthened for the optional second year.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on
available amounts and of 1/8 pct on unavailable amounts, the
sources said. Rothschild is sole agent for this transaction.
    The second transaction, a 16 mln stg credit for the purpose
of working capital, is being arranged by Rothschild alone on
behalf of the Greycoat Group Plc itself. It will be secured on
a property called Brettenham House.
    The margin will be 1/2 point over LIBOR in years one to
four, 5/8 point over LIBOR in years five and six and 3/4 point
over LIBOR thereafter. The credit will mature in June, 1995.
    The sources said that a commitment fee of 20 basis points
will be payable on the available tranche, with 10 basis points
on unavailable amounts.

<TITLE>SULPETRO AWAITS GOVERNMENT APPROVAL ON DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Sulpetro Ltd> said it had not
yet obtained Canadian government approval of a previously
reported agreement to restructure its 505 mln dlr debt, and
remaines dependent in the interim on support from its principal
banker.
    Sulpetro said it was operating as if the restructuring were
implemented, and was required to pay interest only on the term
loan part of its debt.
   It earlier said its net loss for the first quarter ended
January 31 fell to 9.9 mln dlrs from a restated year-earlier
loss of 17.3 mln dlrs.
    Sulpetro president Michael Williams declined to speculate,
in reply to a query, on when government approval of the
restructuring deal was likely.
    The company said first quarter costs fell to 25.4 mln dlrs
from year-ago 45.5 mln dlrs, due partly to lower sales costs
and reduced depletion because of its fiscal 1986 writedown.
    First quarter revenues fell to 14.7 mln dlrs from
year-earlier 29.8 mln because of lower wellhead prices, reduced
gas and natural gas liquids sales, disposal of its British
properties and surrender of part of the Irish-Lindbergh heavy
oil properties, Sulpetro said.

International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal
agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin
Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.
    Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
an extension, delegates said.
    This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
discuss internal matters.
    Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association
of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.
    The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after
a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.

<TITLE>FUNARO SHRUGS OFF CALLS FOR RESIGNATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro shrugged off demands by a group of Brazilian governors
that he resign.
    "At this moment I am discussing something much more serious
for Brazil and it's absolutely indispensible in a negotiation
like this one that I dedicate myself entirely to the
discussions," Funaro told reporters.
    Funaro, who spoke today to the International Monetary
Fund's interim committee, was referring to talks he began
Tuesday with creditor banks in New York in which unveiled
Brazil's economic targets and financial needs.
    The governor of Sao Paulo state Orestes Quersia and other
governors last night called on Brazilian President Jose Sarney
to assume direct control of the debt negotiations.
    Asked if the governors' demands for his resignation would
affect negotiations, Funaro said: "We are building a new
refinancing position and that is what we are doing now. The
rest is secondary."
    He added that Brazil's economic program clearly
demonstrates the intention to renegotiate the countries
international financial committments, and added: "The domestic
problems are our business."
    Funaro said discussions on Brazil's refinancing proposals
were well under way with private creditor banks and added World
Bank President Barber Conable had also accepted the proposals
as "a good plan" at a meeting they had last night.
    But Conable, who was also present at today's IMF interim
committee meeting told reporters that the World Bank wanted
further clarifications on Brazil's economic programs.
    "We wish further clarification about the program with
respect to adjustment lending," Conable said.
    He added that a World Bank mission would travel to Brazil
early next week to explore the state of Brazil's new economic
measures.

    As previously reported, Texaco Inc is seeking a court order
to block Pennzoil from taking action to secure a 10.3 billion
dlr judgement against Texaco.
    In reply to a query, Bijur said Texaco Inc has imposed no
spending retraints on Texaco Canada as it continues previously
reported efforts to make an energy-related acquisition.
    After considering making an acquisition for several months,
Texaco Canada set up a "business development team" of five people
about one month ago to increase its efforts, Bijur said. The
company has also widened the scope of its search to include
candidates involved in refining and marketing as well as
production segments of the industry.
    "We're going to widen the scope of our view. We're going to
look at the downstream and we're going to look at the entire
petroleum business," he said.
    Bijur declined to specify how much money Texaco Canada
would spend on an acquisition.
    Bijur said the company was not close to concluding any
acquisitions and declined to specify when he expected a
transaction might be made. "We're not in a hurry," he said.
    Texaco Canada said in the annual report it had a cash
position of 808 mln dlrs at the end of 1986, and Bijur said the
company's cash fund has not changed materially during the first
quarter.
    Commenting on earnings results, Bijur said he expected
first quarter profit to be lower than last year's earnings of
84 mln dlrs or 70 cts a share, due to lower profit contribution
from production because of lower oil prices.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Seagram, Seagram Co Ltd's
U.S. marketing arm for Joseph E. Seagram and Son's distilled
spirits and wine coolers, said it is replacing its four current
national spirits companies with a single sales force, one
marketing unit and a centralized finance and administrative
function.
    Effective May four, House of Seagram said its sales force
will operate nationally through seven, equal-sized regions,
five in open states and two in control states, Seagram said.
    The change reflects a more aggressive marketing and sales
focus on the local level, the company said.
    A vice president-general manager will head each region,
reporting to Jerome Mann, executive vice president, Seagram
said, adding that Sales, Seagram Distillers, 375 Spirits,
Perennial Sales and Summit Sales will cease to exist as
companies.
    "We will no longer have individual spirits companies, the
resulting internal competition for distributor and retailer
attention or centalized decision making on virtually all
issues," Edgar Bronfman, House of Seagram president, said.
    Seagram said the group that markets Seagram's line of wine
coolers, the be caled the Seagram Beverage Co, will not be
affected by the reorganization.
    The company added that Seagram Beverage will remain inside
the House of Seagram, but separate from the spirits unit.

<TITLE>IRT PROPERTY LAUNCHES DEBENTURE IN EUROMARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>IRT Property Co, a real estate investment
trust based in Atlanta, Georgia, has launched a 30 mln dlr
convertible subordinated debenture in the Euromarket, a partner
of Chandler Partnership Ltd said.
    The issue is unique in several respects and is only one of
a handful of such deals to be brought to this market, he said.
    Unlike most eurobonds, the issue will not be underwritten.
Instead, IRT mandated Chandler Partnership to find potential
investors with whom the issue can be preplaced and to then
place on a "best efforts" basis what ever amount may not be
subscribed.
    Chandler itself was set up in the Isle of Jersey in the
middle of last year as a partnership, whose members have been
involved in financial markets.
    The deal has two sponsors who assist in the placement--
Interallianz Bank Zurich AG and Nivison Cantrade Ltd, a small
U.K. Trading firm that formerly was broker R. Nivison and Co.
    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual
coupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted
into shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.
    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock
Exchange at 19-7/8.
    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are
callable at the company's option after the first two years.
    On or after August 1989 the company can call half the
debentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the
conversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the
conversion price, Nivison said.
    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the
bonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of
7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a
yield of 7.383 pct.
    The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will be
listed in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.
    Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent which
states that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds two
to one the debentures cannot be converted unless the company
obtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.
    Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is less
than one to one.
    The Chandler partner said that this type of deal gives the
borrower funds that are less costly than if it had done an
issue in the U.S. Domestic market.

    Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an

freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
    An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
the government had refused for legal reasons.
    The official denied trade reports that the government might
have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
original tender.

<TITLE>HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over
decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
management was counter-productive, he said.

<TITLE>CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's trade picture has brightened
considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
dlrs.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory."

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting
higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on
the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in
Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the
entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.
    The banking firm said the non-performing status of these
loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.
    Earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs
or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in
the year-ago period.
    Nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate
were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514
mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1
mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at March 31, 1986.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln
dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when
there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.
Net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year
earlier.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Salomon, managing director of
Salomon Inc, said rumors the Wall Street firm suffered bond
trading losses in the first quarter are not true.
    Salomon said the rumors affected the company's stock and 
are "unequivocally denied."
    The Salomon share price was off 5/8 at 37-1/2, but it had
been off more than one dlr on heavy volume earlier in the day.
    Analysts said the rumors have been circulating in the
market for several days.
   
    Salomon said the firm will report first quarter results on
April 22 or 23.
    Analysts said the stock would have reacted poorly today,
even without the rumors, because of the decline in the stock
and bond markets.
    Other brokerages were also down today. E.F. Hutton &lt;EFH>
fell one to 41-1/4. Bear Stearns and Co &lt;BSC> slipped 3/8 to

<TITLE>CLEVITE &lt;CLEV> AMENDS RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GLENVIEW, ILL., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Clevite Industries Inc, which
earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.
Industries Inc &lt;JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
company and stockholders.
    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
price.
    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
approval.
    The company said it acted inview of the proposed
acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
its ability to redeem the rights.

    The indicated totals include reported commitments to both
named and unnamed destinations, sales on exporters' own account
and optional origin sales plus actual exports already made
during the respective marketing seasons.
    The USDA cautions that reported outstanding sales are
subject to modification, deferral or cancellation and it is
unlikely that all reported quantities will be exported.
    USDA gave detailed breakdowns for the 1986/87 and 1987/88
seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
 (A) - Firm sales to a declared destination.
 (B) - Ultimate destination not yet declared.
 (C) - Sales made on exporters' own account.
 (D) - Exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
from origins other than U.S.
 (E) - Accumulated exports since season began based on data 
reported by exporters.
 (F) - Indicated total for season.
 (G) - USDA-projected exports for season.
 Note -- Totals may not add due to rounding.

<TITLE>HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said that under the measures passed by the
committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence
over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
management was counter-productive, he said.

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA WARNS ABOUT CURRENCY SHIFTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shifts
could damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and called
for cooperation in exchange markets.
    In a statement to the International Monetary Funds Interim
Committee, Miyazawa said it was imperative that current account
surplus countries follow policies designed to strengthen
domestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining price
stability. He said Japan intended to carry out policies
announced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers to
stimulate its economy.
    Miyazawa said that, given the massive external imbalances
and serious unemployment in some countries, "there are very real
fears of a protectionist uprising."
    In addition, "we are most concerned about this very serious
problem of exchange rate instability," Miyazawa said.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in
the European/Mediterranean area continued to show strong gains
last week, increasing nearly two percentage points to 46.1 pct,
Offshore Data Services said.
    The total number of working rigs in Europe and the
Mediterranean region was 71, reflecting an increase of three
during the week, compared to a total of 111 working rigs at
this time last year. In the previous week, the area also gained
three working rigs.
    Offshore Data Services said the worldwide utilization rate
for the week remained steady at 53.9 pct, reflecting a total of
392 working rigs. Last year, a total of 479 rigs were working
throughout the world.
    In the Gulf of Mexico, the utilization rate decreased
slightly to 35.5 pct, from 35.6 pct the previous week because
of the addition of one rig to the Gulf fleet. A total of 83
rigs were working last week in the Gulf out of a fleet of 234.

<TITLE>SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
month.
    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
USDA said.
    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
average winter-kill," USDA said.
    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
grain recently.
    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

<TITLE>DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
securities.
    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
    The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that
would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
    The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
    Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
    "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
including price," it said in its April 8 letter.

<TITLE>RAI RESEARCH &lt;RAC> SEES LOWER SALE IN NEAR TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAUPPAUGE, N.Y, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>RAI Research Corp said it appears
that the reduced level of sales may continue for the near term.
    Earlier, RAI reported that third quarter net declined to
17,806 dlrs on sales of 1.3 mln dlrs from net income of 328,290
dlrs on sales of 2.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
   It said sales declined as a result of reduced sales of
permion battery separators to Japanese customers and it does
not know the duration or extent of these factors.

<TITLE>SONY CHAIRMAN FORECASTS LOWER PROFITS THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLMAR, France, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio
Morita said Sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a
result of the dollar's decline.
    Sony Corp posted net consolidated income of 41.89 billion
yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's
73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).
    But Morita added that Japan would benefit from the strong
yen by saving on its energy import bill and he expected profits
to recover from 1988 onwards.
    He was speaking to reporters at a sony factory opening
here.

<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department's
latest estimates on 1986/87 Florida orange production and
orange juice yield are bearish for the frozen concentrated
orange juice futures market because the yield increase was
greater than expected, FCOJ traders and analysts said.
    The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJ
per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.
    The government estimated Florida orange production
(excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last
month. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.
    Traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield
increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

<TITLE>NORANDA BEGINS SALVAGE OPERATIONS AT MURDOCHVILLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Toronto, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as
24 hours before they were brought to safety.
    Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed
6,000 feet of conveyor belt.
     Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp
leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company
said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation
along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
     Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone
will not be completed before the end of April.
    Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the
Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting
an investigation into the fire.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until the
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680
people.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter

<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, WIS., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diana Corp said it organized the
Stockholders Protective Committee of Freedom Federal Savings
Bank to nominate two candidates for election to the Freedom
board at the April 20 annual meeting.
    It said the committee's nominees, Richard Fisher, Diana
chairman and Harold Sampson, a Diana director, will oppose
nominees of the present board of directors.
    Diana, which is 60 pct owned by Farm House Foods Corp
&lt;FHFC>, owns 105,554 shares of Freedom Federal common stock.
    Diana noted that Freedom Federal's board recently declared
a distribution of Preferred Stock Purchase Rights "with the aid
of which such directors might disapprove, and perhaps prevent,
possible acquisition offers or substantial stock accumulations,
regardless of how beneficial they might be to the
stockholders."
    The company said "we want to increase the responsiveness of
the (Freedom Federal) board to stockholder concerns."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said its auction of

554 mln dlrs in non-competitive bids from the public.
    The average price of the one-year bills was 94.014 and the
range was 94.055 to 94.004.

and sent to the Senate a trillion dlr spending budget that
calls for domestic and defence cuts and higher taxes to reduce

    The measure proposes cutting the deficit from 171 billion

Budget Office calculations, or to 108 billion dlrs using more
optimistic assumptions of President Reagan--whose own budget
was defeated earlier.

<TITLE>KIDDER, PEABODY DEFENDS EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kidder, Peabody and Co vice president
Edward Weihenmayer said his company was giving drug tests to
all employees to make sure its funds and assets were being
handled properly.
    "Drugs are easily available in the Wall Street area,"
Weihenmayer told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We move
billions of dollars around in tens of thousands of transactions
daily and have a legitimate interest in the safety and security
of those assets."
    He said customers had a right to expect that their funds
were being handled by sober and drug-free professionals.
    Weihenmayer said almost all Wall Street firms were testing
new employees and many were testing all workers.
    He said Kidder, Peabody would try to help anyone found to
be using drugs, but those who failed a second test would almost
certainly be fired.
   "Our objective is to strive for a drug-free enviroment," he
said.
    Committee chairman Joseph Biden said drug tests posed a
difficult problem in balancing the rights of workers with the
need for companies to eliminate drugs from the work-place.
    "There is no easy answer," the Delaware Democrat said.

Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government
securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI
Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.
    Acquisition documents have been signed and are being held
in escrow pending the receipt of certain consents, it said.
    In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased
brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.
    Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental
was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage
division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.
    Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly
used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the
most active Treasury issues.
    By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the
heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be
facilitated, the company said.
    "The new system is expected to substantially enhance the
liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.
    The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around
April 20.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA WARNS IT MAY CUT OFF TALKS WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Hume, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's Economy Minister Juan
Sourrouille said the "narrow interest" of creditor banks was
holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned
Argentina may break off negotiations.
    "It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some
banks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a
policy we have agreed with the international community,"
Sourrouille said.
    Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim
Committee meeting, Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample
proof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.
    "Today, with that same responsibility, we are clearly
stating that it will be imposible for us to continue
negotiating on that basis."
    A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a
vantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,
said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names
of banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.
    "Let's give them a call right away," the source quoted Baker
as saying.
    Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF
last February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a
longer-term credit, known as an extended Fund Facility for
another 500,000 dlrs.
    But he said that despite Argentina's "disciplined effort" to
achieve inflation-free economic growth, it was unable to obtain
IMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and
settlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks.
    Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a
long-established practice under which debtor countries which
reached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a
good credit risk for the banks.
    "In other words, facts are demonstrating that the current
debt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak
signal for the beginning of another discussion (with the
banks)," he stated.
    He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also
demonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program
had to join in a bridge loan for his country.
    Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements
regarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal
policies.
    Despite this Sourrouille said, "What we are facing is the
inexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking
negotations."
    Argentina, with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs, has been
seeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in "old debt" and another
4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985.
    The minister also said there were two issues separating
Argentina from an accord with creditor banks, one was a minimum
difference on the interest rate margin above international
levels.
    The other condition, of more concern, were suggestions by
the banks that would upset the country's financial system.
    Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering
Argentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct, which
they gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement.
    The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the
lower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor.

announced the prevailing world market price, adjusted to U.S.
quality and location, for Strict Low Middling, 1-1/16 inch
upland cotton at 50.57 cts per lb, to be in effect through

    The adjusted world price is at average U.S. producing
locations (near Lubbock, Texas) and will be further adjusted
for other qualities and locations. The price will be used in
determining First Handler Cotton Certificate payment rates.
    The department said since the adjusted world price is above

no First Handler Cotton Certificates will be issued during the
period.
    Based on data for the week ended April 9, the adjusted
world price for upland cotton is determined as follows, in cts

<TITLE>ROCKY MOUNT &lt;RMUC> HOLDERS SEEK BOARD CONTROL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A shareholder group controlling 48.3
pct of the stock of Rocky Mount Undergarment Co Inc told the
Securities and Exchange Commission it will try to take control
of the company by taking over its board of directors.
    The group, which includes David Greenberg, Rocky Mount's
former president, and several other members of the Greenberg
family, said it had been close to an agreement with the company
on board representation when talks broke down.
    As a result, it will propose its own slate of directors and
vote for that slate at the company's April 24 annual  meeting,
the group said.
    David Greenberg had been president and chairman of Rocky
Mount until May 1986 when he resigned at the board's request.
    David's younger brother, Herbert Greenberg, was a vice
president until November 1986, when he was fired by the board.
    However, Herbert refused to resign his board seat and
remains a company director.
    Rocky Mount sued the group in federal court in North
Carolina earlier this month, charging that its accumulation of
Rocky Mount stock amounted to an illegal tender offer in
violation of the federal securities laws.

<TITLE>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

Douglas Danforth said he was encouraged by first quarter
results for fiscal 1987, and said the company was positioned to
capitalize on the economy's modest growth for the rest of the
year.
    "I am encouraged by the continuing improvement in
earnings," Danworth said. "The first quarter met our
expectations."
    Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of
151.6 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, on revenues of 2.32
billion dlrs.
    Danworth attributed the results to an increase in the
operating profit in the energy and advanced technology,
industries and commerical segments.

<TITLE>AMR (AMR) TO START INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp's American Airlines will start
its own information campaign in its dispute with the
Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000
attendants since late last year, will give out information
brochures at its terminals, outlining its position, according
to L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.
    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA was
conducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at the
company's terminals. The union says it was trying to win public
support by presenting its position.
     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants for
handing out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The
union is fighting the move in court.
     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's
latest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was
offered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,
whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those
hired before 1983.
     However, the union has contended that the company's
proposal keeps the system in a disguised form.
     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to
American's announcement.
     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of
a federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was
triggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer
of binding arbitration.
     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to
strike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its
latest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.
     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not
strike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received
permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up
the hiring of new attendants.
     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was
thinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.
     "It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,"
he said.

in the U.S. of its "Europe on Us" for travel from the U.S. due
to disapproval by the U.S. Department of Transporation on
grounds of reciprocity.
    Under the promotional program, customers would buy a round
trip from the U.S. to London and would receive a free round
trip ticket from London to one of 45 cities in 16 countries.
    A company spokesman said the Transportation Department's
contention was that American carriers could not compete in this

decision.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.

<TITLE>NORANDA BEGINS MURDOCHVILLE MINE SALVAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TORONTO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noranda Inc said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor
belt.
    The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe
rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.

<TITLE>LTV &lt;QLTV> TO MAKE ONE-TIME BENEFIT PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>LTV Corp said it will seek approval from
the U.S. bankruptcy court to make one-time hardship payments to
retired steelworkers who lost some pension benefits when their
retirement plans were terminated.
    The payments would range from 100 dlrs to 750 dlrs per
person for more than 9,800 steel company salaried and hourly
retirees, LTV said.
    The company's steel unit retirement plans were terminated
in January by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which
said the plans were insolvent.
    LTV filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July 17.
    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors
while it works out a plan to pay debts.
    While most regular pension payments were continued after
LTV Steel Co's pension plans were terminated, some retirees got
a reduction in their supplemental early retirement benefits or
other payments that were more than maximums guaranteed by the
federal agency.
    LTV also began talks with the United Steelworkers union,
and both sides have made a commitment to reach a new labor
agreement by May 1, the steel, aerospace and energy concern
said.
    LTV has the right to renegotiate its labor contracts while
operating in Chapter 11. At issue are pension and health
benefits for active and retired employees and other items, such
as use of manpower and equipment.
    The company plans to present a comprehensive proposal to
the U.S. bankruptcy court in May to deal with pensions and
health care benefits for steel and energy retirees and health
care benefits for aerospace retirees, it said.
    All LTV retirees are currently receiving health and life
insurance payments mandated by federal laws passed in October
that have been extended until May 15.
