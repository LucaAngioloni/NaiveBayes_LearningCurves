<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,
soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill
to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains
producers.
    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter
wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility
of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support
payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.
    He also said his bill would protect program participants
from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose
above the loan rate.

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS U.S. OPPOSES SOVIET BANK MEMBERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund.
    Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think
our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support
and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the
IMF."
    Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified and
unconditional."
    The secretary observed that he has written to congressman
Jack Kemp, a New York Republican who is also a presidential
contender, outlining the U.S. position.
    Baker was responding to a questioner who noted that World
Bank President Barber Conable has in the past suggested future
Soviet membership could take place.
    Ever since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev suggested Soviet
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade --
which was also rejected -- there has been speculation Moscow
was interested in joining the international institutions.

<TITLE>SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson
Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks
today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in
holding to its prescribed production quotas.
    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota
restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.
    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to
higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes
said he recommends Imperial Oil &lt;IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,
Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON> one to
83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.
    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic
Richfield &lt;ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is
still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose
1-3/4 to 77.
    He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a
barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is
positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher
oil prices."
    He noted that belief that the government is interested in
raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil
stocks today.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
invited the European Community's 17-man Commission for talks in
Bonn next month in a bid to repair strained relations, EC
diplomats said.
    The Commissioners, led by President Jacques Delors, will
pay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due for
a meeting with the principal West German cabinet members.
    The meeting, the first of its kind between the Commission
and the government of a member state, was originally meant to
focus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution.
    But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated by
Commission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances and
its costly farm policy, which have provoked strong opposition
from Bonn.
    Kohl has written two letters to Delors, complaining that
the plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farm
minister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two German
members of the Commission for failing to oppose them.
    This caused protest from Brussels where the Commission
tries to guard the independence of its members from the
governments that nominate them.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala
confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South
Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had
closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an
interview the government was diverting all mineral exports
along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in
Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper
and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,
but he said there had not been any problem with the new
arrangements.
    "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations
without hindrance," he told the Times.
    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia
exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and
17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic
sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's
ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam
without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in
Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes
to get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said that he had given that message to Brazilian
officials earlier this month when they met for talks in
Washington.
    He said that the so-called Cruzado Plan had worked for a
while, but that new efforts by the government are now required.
    Baker made it clear that he backed the decision by the
Paris Club official creditors to reschedule loans to Brazil,
even though the country later froze its payments to commercial
bank creditors.
    He said that the official loans are being serviced and that
this was a result of the rescheduling.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell
65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real
estate to F.W. Woolworth Co &lt;Z> have ended.
    Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the
talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to
give a reason.
    Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain.
The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.
    "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
    The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country
in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
    Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores.
"The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made
is that we will continue to operate them," he said
    Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.

<TITLE>U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct
at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by
the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged
when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,
Lawson said.
    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling
M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be
taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as
the exchange rate.
    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to
the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the
corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business
sector in particular.
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the
PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.

in 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German Feed
Stuff Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs
sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around
75 pct in 1986.
    He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk
quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to
cheaper imports from abroad.
    "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"
Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production to
decline steadily."
    The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by
0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes
from 3.23 mln, he said.
    Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairy
cattle will decline even more this year because of the further
cut in milk output from April.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The &lt;New York Stock Exchange> said it
is undertaking a review of the long-term effects on securities
markets of computer-driven trading techniques known as program
trading.
    The NYSE said, "The study will review major new trading
techniques involving programmed portfolio hedging and index
arbitrage for their potential benefits and risks to the
financial system.  It will also explore the regulatory
implications of these trading techniques and whether their
increased use could possibly lead to market abuse."
    The exchange said a final report is expected before the end
of 1987.  It said program trading is becoming increasingly
important as a market factor.

<TITLE>PHOENIX CANADA OIL TO APPEAL RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Phoenix Canada Oil Co Ltd> said it
intends to appeal a ruling in U.S. Federal District Court of
Delaware on its suit against Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, Chevron Corp
&lt;CHV>, Chevron's Gulf Oil unit and their Ecuador subsidiaries.
    The court ruled against Phoenix's claim that a royalty it
held should have entitled it to a share of the 160 mln U.S.
dlrs paid to the defendants when they sold 62.5 pct of their
working interest in Ecuador oil operations, Phoenix said.
    However, the court did award Phoenix 1,250,000 Canadian
dlrs in underpayments, the company said.
    Phoenix Canada Oil said the fiduciary relationship that
existed between Phoenix, as the royalty owner, and the
defendants, as the working interest operators, was fundamental
in the oil industry and was not reflected in the court's
ruling.

<TITLE>CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Haydon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conservative gains in Finnish general
elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets,
though there will not be a radical economic restructuring,
conservative officials and economic analysts said.
    The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after
the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political
commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is
likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.
    International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: "we are
willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible."
    Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition
had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its
period of government between 1983 and 1987.
    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to
other European conservative movements and had, for example,
shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.
    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties
with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right
coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.
   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade
must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January
agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.
    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude
oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.
    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-
Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim
exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.
    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the
election news, with little movement in the markka or on the
Helsinki stock exchange.
    Securities analysts said the market would respond positively
if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too
early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would
hang on to power.
    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation
governing the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."
    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment
of an internal market between the Nordic countries.
     International capital markets were becoming more and more
important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the
development of Finland's capial markets.
   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties
with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be
studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade
Association ( EFTA).
    Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties
are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new
government will probably not be established before the start of
April.
    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained
three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56
seats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp may place its
long-term loans to Brazil on nonaccrual status if Brazil
continues to defer interest payments on the loans, the bank
holding company said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Brazil currently
total about 2.7 billion dlrs, including about 1.5 billion dlrs
in long-term loans and 1.2 billion dlrs in short-term loans.
    The Brazilian government announced in February its
intention to stop paying interest temporarily on its long-term
public and private sector commercial bank debt.
    "Continued deferral of interest payment on these obligations
could result in the loans being placed on nonaccrual status,"
the banking firm said.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Mexico currently
total about 2.5 billion dlrs, of which about 215 mln dlrs of
loans have been reported as either nonaccrual or past due 90
days or more.
    Outstanding loans to Venezuela currently total about 1.3
billion dlrs, of which 241 mln dlrs of loans have been reported
as either nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more, it said.

<DATELINE>    LINZ, Austria, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned &lt;Chemie Linz AG> is
likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings
compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said.
    Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were
largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the
effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S.
Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters.
    The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not
been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary &lt;Merx
HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from
the oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July.

<DATELINE>    BONN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The proposed European Community (EC) tax
on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the
agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the
West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
the West German feed industry believes the EC does not
seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it
would end in another transatlantic trade war.
    "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the
Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."
    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne
Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers
were confident the tax would be rejected.
    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on
a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on
Thursday and Friday.
    There are indications the Bonn government will also reject
the proposed tax, Wagner said.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil
company, said in a published interview today that it was
reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
close on of its french refineries.
    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
during the interview.
    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
improvement in the European refining situation, its future
profits there should be good.
    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
earnings," Mlotok said.
    "Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the
highest grade refiners in Europe," he added.
    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
these producers move further into downstream operations.
    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
refineries.
    PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last
year."

<TITLE>ITALY STANCE ON EC OILS TAX NOT ENCOURAGING-ASA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's response to protests by U.S.
Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC)
tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging,
American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George
Fluegel said.
    Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer
delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told
Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the
Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded
much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the
proposed tax.
    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative
response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the
attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."
    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.
Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.
    Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against
the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information
we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans,
hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation also
hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.
    Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might
take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved,
Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could
be involved.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC
yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the
tax.
    ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The
Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed
tax would be rejected.

<DATELINE>    TEL AVIV, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Israel has drawn up a five-year plan
for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs
to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli
Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be
increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.
    The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level
of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in
80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985
level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in
force, the ministry said.
    Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000
tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82
pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or
48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Societe Generale de Belgique &lt;BELB.BR>
said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large
part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.
    The company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit
of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said
its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving
further figures.
    However, it added in a statement that the company made
major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular
from the sale of Genstar shares.
    Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's
annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5
billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco
Limited &lt;IMS.TO>.
    He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion
francs after a rough balance in 1985.
    In today's statement, Societe Generale gave no figures for
extraordinary gains.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal by two U.S. House
Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and
medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a
House subcommittee today.
    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said
Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the
first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."
    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
years, protect family farms and eliminate government
accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
halted.
    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
family farmer is."
    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.
    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and
therefore eligible for payments.

computer-driven trading techniques known as program trading.
    The NYSE said, "The study will review major new trading
techniques involving programmed portfolio hedging and index

    "It will also explore the regulatory implications of these
trading techniques and whether their increased use could
possibly lead to market abuse."
    The exchange said a final report is expected before the end

important as a market factor.

U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a
preliminary injunction, enjoining &lt;Zico Investment Holding
Inc's> tender offer for Bancroft.
    It said the Court order prevents Zico from buying any
shares tendered to them during the offer, which began on Feb.
17, 1987.
    In the tender offer blocked by the Court, Zico offered to
buy 500,000 shares, or about 22 pct of Bancroft's outstanding
stock, for 30 dlrs a share.
    Previously, Zico had bought 965,000 Bancroft shares for 31
dlrs a share, giving it about 28 pct of the company. If the
recent offer had gone through, the Zico would have owned
slightly more than 50 pct of Bancroft's outstanding shares.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia will reintroduce a modified
foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a
new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard
Chivuno said.
    Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks
of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that
there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions
and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types
of business.
    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to
distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine
the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end
of January.
    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was
suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation
and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had
resulted.
    Business and banking sources said another reason for
suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on
foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful
bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system
was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15
per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.
    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of
about nine kwacha per dollar.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil
producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
not immediately available against other development
expenditure, the statement said.
    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
basin for which development
consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
liability.
    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
Revenue said.
    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
encourage general research into ways of reducing field
development costs, it said.
    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
stg a year, it calculated.
    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
    These included measures to allow companies to balance their
shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
past periods of allowance utilisation.
    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its
continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
might also be encouraged, he said.
    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
year.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Eastern Corp's Texas Eastern
Gas Pipleline unit President Howard C. Homeyer said the company
is committed to cleaning up polychlorinated biphyenyls PCBs
from its pipeline system.
    In testimony before Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.),
oversight committee on Environment and Public Works, a press
statement said Homeyer said the company will work with the
Environmental Protection Agency to immediately clean up
contaminated sites.
    The New York Times today reported that the EPA knew as
early as the fall of 1985 about PCB contamination at sites
along the Texas Eastern pipeline, but took no action because
the company supplied insufficient information.
    According to the Times, Texas Eastern admitted burying PCBs
at 51 sites along its right of way.
    Homeyer told the committee, according to a statement, that
the cleanup will require cooperation among EPA headquarters,
six EPA regions and a dozen states to avoid delays.
    Texas Eastern officials were not immediately available for
comment.

<TITLE>ATT-PHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co and
Philips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct through
direct and indirect holdings in France's &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with French
partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a
director at one of the partner firms said.
    Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>
SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.> and the
NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>.
    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.
   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
close discussions within the government due to legal queries
over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
official said.
    Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and
&lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled by
Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.
    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
francs by private tender.
    Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
foreign stakes in CGCT.
    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.
    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed
to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
French standards.
    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
bidding among a wider range of applicants.
    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's
Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA>
subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson
&lt;ERIC.ST> allied with Matra &lt;MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down," he said.
    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
"There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

an out-of-court settlement with the Federal Trade Commission
over the labeling of some down-filled garments sold in 1978 "to
avoid further legal expenses."
    In a statement, Michael Bozic, chairman of Sears
Merchandise Group, said "As part of the voluntary corrective
program, Sears removed 75 mln dlrs worth of down-filled
merchandise from sale prior to the FTC investigation, retested
and where necessary, relabeled goods and nationally offered a
full refund."
    Sears said it was "the only retailer to take extensive
steps to protect consumers, despite the fact that down-labeling
discrepancies were industry-wide in 1978."
    Both Sears and Kellwood Co, a Sears supplier, agreed to pay
penalties of 200,000 dlrs each to settle the charges.

<TITLE>AMEX CALLS FOR UNIFORM EXPIRATION PROCEDURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Stock Exchange said it is
prepared to move settlement prices for its broad-based stock
index contracts to the stock market opening on expiration
Fridays providing the change is part of an industry-wide move
to a uniform system.
    "We believe it is in the best interests of the industry for
all markets to participate  in a coordinated move to base
expiration Friday settlement prices on the stock market
opening," Amex president Kenneth Leibler said in a statmenet.
    He said non-uniform procedures will lead to "market and
investor confusion."
    Leibler said expirations based on openings "appears to
offer greater opportunities than the close to most efficiently
handle any order imbalances which may occur on expiration
Fridays."
    He said the markets would have the remainder of the trading
day to correct any "price dislocations" that occur. Market
analysts have attributed some wide swings in the stock market
in part to arbitrage activity involving index options and
futures and individual stocks.
    Options on the Major Market Index and the Institutional
Index, which now expire at the close, are traded on the Amex.

<TITLE>OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

    Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association
conference current exchange rates of major currencies "can be
viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."
    He said the recent Paris agreement on currency
stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five
and Canada may herald "an era of greater exchange rate
stability."
    The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up
permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed,
adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and
enforce on an international level.
    "At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered
grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and
the yen," Gleske said.
    He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies
of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and
Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.
    But "a further dollar depreciation against major European
currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the
dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its
weighted external value," he said.
   In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would
hold two major dangers, Gleske said.
    First, in countries with large balance of payments
surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to
hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real
income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out
surpluses.
    Second, in the United States, it could damage investors'
confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to
finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske
said.
    Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international
system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in
narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such
targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, "both within
countries and between them."
    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund
its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high
levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.
    If target zones were established, this would put "pressure
on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,
even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic
situation and priorities," he said.
    Gleske added, "targeting the exchange rate even within a
wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a
clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and
external policy priorities."
    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its
chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current
interest rate differentials being maintained.
    These chances "seem to me to rest critically on the
expectation that the current configuration of interest rates,
and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth
financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead."
    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had
learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus
tend to overshoot." He said this "would seem to be unnecessary
and should be avoided if at all possible."
    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if
markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will
lead to balanced international payments, he said.

approved legislation which would require the Treasury Secretary
to begin negotiations on the establishment of an international
debt adjustment facility.
    The facility would buy up some of the debt of less
developed countries and sell it to banks at a discount.
    The facility was proposed by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., who
said it would help ease the third world debt crisis. It was
approved by the House International Finance subcommittee and
sent to the full House Banking Committee, which will consider
the measure next week.
    The legislation is part of the omnibus trade bill being

<DATELINE>    LEVERKUSEN, West Germany, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German chemical
group Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it had received claims for damages
from haemophilics who allege they were infected with AIDS
through a blood plasma produced by a Bayer subsidiary.
    Bayer's shares fell 13 marks to close at 292 in Frankfurt
today. Dealers said a newspaper report about possible huge
claims for damages triggered off the share selling in Bayer,
other pharmaceuticals and insurance companies.
    Bayer said in a statement it was insured against claims and
had received two. Bayer did not rule out that some infections
may have been passed on through the plasma in the past.
    But the company added that the method of production had
been changed and according to current knowledge there was now
no danger of contracting AIDS through the blood plasma. The
plasma is used by haemophilics to aid the clotting of blood.
    The Hamburg-based news magazine "Der Spiegel" reported in its
latest edition that the West German pharmaceutical industry
could face billions of marks worth of claims for damages from
infected haemophilics and their relatives.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PLAYBOY &lt;PLA> HAS NO RESTRUCTURING PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no
plans to restructure or to take the company private.
    Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more
than 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his
stock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said. 
    Articles in two weekly business publications have said
Playboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial
analysts see as its undervalued asset base.
    Radomski said there were no corporate developments to
account for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but
that there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.
    Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover
of about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has
traded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.
    The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark
Boyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs
a share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about
130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real
estate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and
its excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs,
according to Business Week.
    According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion
and artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share,
the Forbes Magazine article said.
    According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most
recognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.
    Radomski, noting that the articles were written without
contact with Playboy, said that "from time to time people do
speculate about the company."
    She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in
the "last day or so" for a reaction to the articles.
    American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes
"anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged
buyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are
nil." Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the
company private, he said.
    But "shareholders who held the stock prior to all the
publicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money," he
said.
    Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value
of the company is likely to exceed the current price of the
stock. "But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take
management at their word," he said.
    While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a
drain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees
potential. "They do have a management plan for the cable
operation and the company as a whole," he said. "Were this plan
to, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for
earnings is significant," he said.

earnings for the fourth quarter ended January 31 were affected
by the weak economies of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana,
resulting in a drop in net earnings to 5,415,000 dlrs or 92 cts
a share from 7,730,000 dlrs or 1.28 dlrs a share for the
year-ago quarter.
    The company also said sales on the West Coast were hurt by
late snows and poor skiing conditions.
    Same-store sales declined 3.2 pct for the quarter and 2.2
pct for the year.
    For the full year, Oshman's net earnings fell to 2,664,000

    In 1986, the company said it opened nine stores and closed

<TITLE>CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Light, scattered showers covered
winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended
March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy
in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce
Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative
stage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North China
Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the
south.
     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,
eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed
February's below normal precipitation pattern.
    The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided
ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for
irrigation. 
    Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi and
Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, it
said.

<TITLE>U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.

<TITLE>COASTAL (CGP) SEES INCREASE IN 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coastal Corp said it expected earnings
for 1987 "to be significantly above" profits of 71.6 mln dlrs
last year.
    In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's
newly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt
did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
increase.
    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and
pipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping
energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
last year.
    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average
price of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the
previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.
    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average
of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it
had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil
and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve
replacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent
during the past three-year period, representing a little more
than half of the industry average, the company said.
    Coastal's more than 800 gasoline retail outlets were
operated profitably during 1986 "and are expected to continue
to do so," the company said.

<TITLE>U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>an eventual oil import fee in the
united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
eventualities in this regard," he told reuters during the
signing ceremony here.
    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one more
step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
world markets."
   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
clear benefits to both sides," he said.
    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
obtain a competitive product yield.
    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
on today's agreement," adams said.
    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
to take advantage of bigger margins.
    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
yield of white products.

Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting
companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the
Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.
    Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), was
scheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said.
    "The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously
one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, but
they haven't any agenda as far as I know," Lyng's aide said.
    Private industry export officials have met periodically
with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation.
Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue
of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is
uncertain, the aide said.
    "I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't already
knwo, but we'll hear what they have to say," Lyng's aide said.
    The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has
been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under
the EEP.

<TITLE>ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft
proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
should operate, they said.
    The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
set by a formula, the delegates said.
    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
work from, one consumer delegate said.
    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for
negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.

    In the south, striking shipyard workers clashed with police
in the port of Cadiz in what has become a regular weekly

<TITLE>GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance and economy ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to
discuss further economic integration, officials said.
    They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank
governors on a common currency exchange rate.
    The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which
to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be
forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in
Saudi Arabia late this year.
    The six states have different currency systems. Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the
International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the
special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.
    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while
Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by
itself.
    The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not
been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be
linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.
    Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of
State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint
economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of
GCC citizens together."
    The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met
in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's
Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim
    The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic
and investment projects in the GCC.
    Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31
billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry weather pushed further into
South Africa's Orange Free State's Maize Triangle in the week
ended March 14, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the
U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
    In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency
said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry
pockets persisted in the northeast and south.
    Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal
throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in
areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.
    The agency said rainfall during February was near to above
normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather
reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and
southern Orange Free State.

<TITLE>U.K. BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government
bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices
race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.
    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his
speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely
sharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose
about two points on the day.
    "This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,"
Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.
    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the
budget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial
bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point
tomorrow.
    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection
of supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget
was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held
to 4.0 billion stg.
    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion
stg.
    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer
far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and
the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,
analysts said.
    "The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically
expected," Bell said. Most market expectations called for the
Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.
    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said
that overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less
in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in
total new issue volume.
    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy
Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion
stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap
issues.
    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full
price does not have to be paid until the start of the new
fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current
year's fund raising.
    But the Bank of England will also be constrained from
issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try
out a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new
stock.
    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked
issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail
Price Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to
be raised in the form of traditional stock.
    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two
pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line
with most market expectations, although some operators had
expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.
    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,
Shepherd said, because "If it was more than two pct, they would
have become concerned about the economy heating up again."
    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the
ruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut
can be offered at budget time next year.
    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam
on the political implications of the budget which suggests an
early election.
    "All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the
middle of May," Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. "This makes a June
election very likely."
    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from
the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of
mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on
pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.
    At that rate, they would have been of little use for a
political party expecting to call an election in June.
    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with
measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.
    "This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour
party to attack," Shepherd said.

<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said it was
in the second round of two-week-old negotiations with about
3,200 unionized workers at its Trail and Kimberley, British
Columbia zinc-lead operations.
    The existing two-year contracts expire April 30. The
workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America.
    A Cominco spokesman, queried by Reuters, declined to
comment on whether the company was confident of reaching a new
agreement before April 30, but said the union had not yet taken
a strike vote.
    The contracts cover 2,600 production workers at Trail and
Kimberley and 600 office and technical staff at the two
operations.
    Trail produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long
tons of lead in 1986. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced
2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the
Trail smelter.

    The suit comes in the wake of an Illinois Commerce

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry weather covered most European
crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in
southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and
Commerce Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency
said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.
    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy
remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.
    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in
early April, it said.
    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas
of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.
    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central
India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by
late April.
    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,
reversing February's below-normal trend.
    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most
southern areas, it said.
    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the
central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon
and southern Mindanao.
    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as
rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.
    In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding
in Java, it said.
    The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan
winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.
    Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to
Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in
Southeast Asia.
    Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and
central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet
crop demands, it said.
    Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained
adequate moisture for crop growth, it said.
    Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as
winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,
the agency said.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Cox, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,
U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It was
a very, very prudent fiscal budget."
    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"
between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
27 pct.
    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
one-point cut tomorrow.
    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
it will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added a
further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"
he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
inflation.
    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
it was "not a good budget for inflation," he said
    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
too concerned about a revival of inflation.
    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
signs of excessive weakness.
    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
to be 4.0 billion stg.
    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
which has to be held before June, 1988.
    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
    But others said it kept several options open and it was not
possible to deduce too much from it.
    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
that there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."
    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

<TITLE>TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
would agree to a takeover.
    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.
    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
dlrs per share.
    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
made on a sale of the company.
    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
share)," said one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
necessary for the broadcast properites.
    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
such as restructuring.
    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
years ago, has about 12 pct.
    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
for 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but he
speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
than a price in the 160s.
    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
speculated the investor would not really be interested in
running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
buyout.
    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
the interests involved," he said, adding the two largest
shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
broadcast industry.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France expects a continued
revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for
any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate
remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.
    The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the
agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall
in January, while construction and civil engineering
experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the
next few months.
    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in
particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.
    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception
of the agro-food industry, improved substantially.
    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last
months.
    Production rose in all sectors except agricultural
machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship
construction, where it declined.
    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in
activity in February, with both domestic and export orders
rising.
    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite
a fall in the household goods sector and stability in
pharmaceuticals.
    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped
by a strong growth in construction materials.
    But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over
the past two months.

<TITLE>HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil
industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and
head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels
per day.
    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a
day.
    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate
for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down
because of budgetary constraints.
    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might
advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax
benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and
development into new ways to extract oil which is now
considered uneconomical to produce.
    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the
Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
    Herrington said that before he disclosed what
recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House
Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase
oil production made good tax policy.
    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one
mln barrels a day.
    The report said that by the end of the century the United
States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil
consumption, posing a serious economic and national security
threat.

<TITLE>U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.
    The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.

    Conrail said the prices, which were effective March one,

    It said the reduced prices also represent a simplification
of the prvious tariff-based rate structure, which used price

constructed from a single table of origin and destination Zip
Codes.

<TITLE>OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC believes world oil prices should
be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.
    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar
in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes
...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."
    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
states could not be sustained in some cases.
    "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
production," Al-Wattari said.
    "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"
Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices.
    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market
requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added.
    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
    But although cutbacks announced by these states were
politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority
of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
calls for supply regulation," he said.
    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

<TITLE>MIDWAY AIRLINES &lt;MDWY> SETS HOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Midway Airlines Inc, which has
frequently been mentioned as an acquisition target, said it
declared a shareholder rights plan.
    Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right on each outstanding share of common stock.
    Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to
purchase one one-hundredth share of Series C Junior
Participating preferred stock for 50 dlrs.
    The rights are intended to assure that all holders receive
fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The company said
this is not in response to a known effort to acquire control.
    The rights will be exercisable 10 days after a person or
group buys 20 pct of the company's common, or announces or
commences a tender offer that would result in acquisition of 30
pct or more of its common.
    Midway can redeem the rights at two cts each at any time
prior to expieration of 10 days after the acquisition by any
person of 20 pct or more of the companyt's common, it said.
    If Midway is acquired, each right will entitle its hodler
to purchase a number of the acquiring company's common shares
having a market value at that time of twice the right's
exercise price.
    The dividend will be payable to holders of record April
six, and expire 10 years later on April 6, 1997.

<TITLE>INTERTAN &lt;ITAN>TO CLOSE GERMAN UNITS,TAKE CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Texas, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Intertan Inc said it plans to
close its 17 company-owned retail stores in Germany and
anticipates this will result in a 6.5 mln dlr charge against
third quarter, ended February 28, results.
    The company took over Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> international
retail operations last September and was spun off to Tandy
holders of record December 31.
    As a result of the proposed Germany closings, Intertan
said, about 57 German employees and 40 support personnel in
Belgium are expected to be discharged.
   
    Intertan said it expects a small staff will be retained in
Germany to service the company's 27 remaining German dealers.
    The company said its German operations had a fiscal 1986
loss of 4.0 mln dlrs on sales of 6.2 mln dlrs. For the first
nine months of fiscal 1987, it had a pre-tax loss of 1.5 mln
dlrs on revenues of 5.4 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela has still to work out final
details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per
day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports
caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA) official said.
    "We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation
will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be
affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal
with Union Pacific Corp today.
    He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by
Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.
    He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be
considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters,
requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to
ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.
    Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as
saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and
remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at
a rate of 35,000 bpd.
    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean
state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company
never allows third parties to trade its oil.

<TITLE>SURALCO ALUMINA EXPORTS DROPPED 75 PCT IN FEB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARAMARIBO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Surinam Aluminum Company
(SURALCO) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in
February after its operations were shut down by worker violence
and guerrilla sabotage, the official Surinam News Agency, SNA,
reported.
    SNA said Suralco's alumina exports dropped to 23,869 tonnes
in February from 92,852 tonnes in January. Aluminum exports,
meanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511
tonnes from 1,647 tonnes.
    Suralco's alumina refinery at Paranam, 18 miles south of
the capital, was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed
plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the
company's nearby aluminum smelter.
    The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti-government
guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit
power to the plant from the Afobaka dam.
    The alumina refinery, owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton
NV, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, was reopened March 9. But
the smelter remains closed, as do the Suralco mines at Moengo,
60 miles east of Paramaribo, which were closed down by
guerrillas last November.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The budget presented by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as
being politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal
prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's
standing with both voters and financial markets.
    The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the
standard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.
    Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a
fall in domestic interest rates and an early election.
    Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget "is
not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible."
    Lawson told journalists later that it was "a budget built on
success, for success."
    But opposition MPs did not agree .
    David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said "this was a
strangely deceptive budget.
    The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has
chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in
the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use
those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty."
    Steel said "the cunning thing in this seductive budget is
that all the good things will come in the pre-election period -
the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the
lower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes
and petrol."
    David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping,
said "this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it
has failed in its objective. It has given money to the "haves" as
opposed to the "have-nots."
    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it "a bribes budget."
    Kinnock said the budget "had little to do with the general
good, and everything to do with the general election."
    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said
"the Tories should have used available resources to invest in
industry, in health and in education."
    He added that "we know that whoever is elected (to power in
the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts."
    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury
expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for
use in cutting taxes or raising public spending.
    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the
government would be forced to call an election by a
deteriorating economy.
    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said
that "the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than
it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh
year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been
combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and
strong, and unemployment is falling."
    He said that "these are the fruits of the government's
determination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to
our policies of sound money and free markets."
    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to
plump for an early election.
    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would
have on election timing, he replied "I think we will hold the
election either late or early. I must confess I am rather
relaxed about it all.
    "There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.
    But he added that "if the Prime Minister decides to go for
an early election, it will bring to an end all this rather
ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is
something to be said for that."
    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said "This budget
will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing
means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI
wanted."
    "We have always said we would judge the budget on how it
affects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick."

the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dismissed

    The union went on strike in March 1986 after failing to

wage concessions from the flight attendants because they were
predominantly female.
    TWA said the commission found that there is no reason to

    The infusion was needed because the value of collateral

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS TAX HIKE NEEDS REAGAN SUPPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18
billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubted
it could pass Congress without President Reagan's support.
    Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committee
was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it
would pass the full House and this would require Republican
votes.
    "Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless
the president signs on," the Illinois Democrat said in remarks
for delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.
    Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on
increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax
intact.
    The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax
rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in
1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct
next year.
    In addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetite
to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"
which he also opposes. "The real question is where the
Republicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.
    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax
credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or
trade bill this year.
    He added that no extension or expansion of the research and
development tax credit for business is expected since it would
cost billions of dollars.
    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker
as Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White
House will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "There are
strong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president
down the slippery slope of moderation," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Surprisingly strong U.S. housing
statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that
the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient
cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,
economists said.
    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually
mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that
seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the
economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And
after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.
    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804
mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April
1986.
    The rate at which permits were issued for future building
climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764
mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.
    "February's weather is usually more adverse for home
building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to
determine what this means for the economy down the road," said
Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for
weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures
inflate the statistics.
    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to
building last month. But several believe that rates will now
consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.
    "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying
'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much
of the financing for home building.
    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward
potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and 
some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.
    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early
summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last
November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.
    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in
the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which
typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high
vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units
following tax law changes effective January 1.
    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317
mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.
    "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low
mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not
looking at a great deal of growth potential," said Ward
McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with
larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial
output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers
to start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter.
Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.
    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to
come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not
convinced that growth will pick up in future.
    "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on
now, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example,
U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,
produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February
compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.
    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first
quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker
growth in the second, he said.
    "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building
and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then
there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"
agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating
first quarter GNP prospects.
    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that
current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.
    "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the
first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the
second," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei
Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

<TITLE>U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
tax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
year.
    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
overshoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
fiscal year.
    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
164.9 billion in the current year.
    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
said.

<TITLE>REYNOLD METALS &lt;RLM> UP ON FURMAN SELZ REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rose
sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and
Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings
potential from the company's Australian gold holding, traders
familiar with the report said.
    Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian
gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share
this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.
    Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of
729,500 shares.
    Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and
the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An
analyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,
together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share
for Reynolds."
    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
in the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investors
that were not completely cognizant of the size or the
importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."
    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was
discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.
Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.
    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits
from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the
production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.
    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share
in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.
    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a
share, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new
accounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards
and other extraordinary items.

<TITLE>ALCAN &lt;AL> MAY MAKE SHARE ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it may issue
up to two mln first preferred shares in addition to an
unlimited number of additional common shares and an unlimited
number of additional preference shares at any time after its
proposed reorganization.
    In a proxy statement, the company said shareholders are to
vote on the reorganization, which would result in Alcan's
wholly-owned Aluminum Co of Canada Ltd unit replacing Alcan
Aluminium as the group's parent company, at the April 23 annual
meeting. The new company will keep the Alcan Aluminium Ltd
name.
    Alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the
additional shares.
    The company has said it is undertaking the reorganization
mainly to streamline management and give Alcan a stronger and
more stable financing base by making the new Alcan a major
operating company as well as a holding and management company.
    "In an increasingly global capital market, this new
structure should also provide for greater flexibility in
financing the Alcan group," the company said.
    Alcan's current only outstanding securities are common
shares while the new company would have outstanding securities
of common, preferred and preference shares, and its debt.
    Each shareholder would automatically become a shareholder
in the new company without exchanging share certificates.
    Alcan later said it has a provision identical to the one
detailed in the proxy statement allowing for the issue of
preferred, common and preference shares, in its existing
corporate structure.

<TITLE>HYDRO-QUEBEC IN HEARINGS FOR U.S. POWER EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hydro-Quebec, the provincially-owned
utility, said it is appearing this week before the National
Energy Board to defend its application to export about five
billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the New England
states.
    The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in
1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebec
utility said hearings are normally held on major contracts up
to two years after the deal is signed.
    Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billion
dlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convince
the board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.
    Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have said
they are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and New
Brunswick utilities said they are objecting because
Hydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going to
the New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is also
concerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export
markets.
    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several
provinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a
power agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec
utility's export contracts.
    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes
to contracts in the past but has always left the agreements
essentially intact.
    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether
it believed the board would call for substantial changes to the
agreement with New England.
    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last
two or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.
    Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export
contracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed
amounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC believes world oil prices should
be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said.
    In a speech to a European Community/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in
Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said, "OPEC believes ...the
world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and
should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of
these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored
to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said.
    "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider
scope of international cooperation," he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Representatives
approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
they did not plant.
    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
broad-scale revision of farm programs.
    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
deficiency payments they would have received.
    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
different crop on that land this spring, although they could
use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
last fall's flooding.
    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
by Congress last fall.
    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
alternative to federal disaster assistance.
    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
savings.
    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
dlrs.
    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
dlrs.
    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
on the disaster assistance program.

<TITLE>H.J. HEINZ &lt;HNZ> POISED FOR RECORD YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.J. Heinz Co is "within sight of our
22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for
the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.
    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said
the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year
history."
    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55
cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion
dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big
brands, new products and services, new geography, internal
growth and acquisitions.
    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in
history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive
said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a
concern to us."
    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and
will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln
dlrs.
    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture
with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which
produces dry baby food cereal.
    He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its
first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new
partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new
manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,
South Korea.
    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at
manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.
    He said a modernization program is in effect at the
company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,
trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced
to 2,500 in 1988.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>An attorney was named today in a
24-count federal indictment alleging he initiated an insider
trading scheme which allowed friends and relatives to make
nearly 1.5 mln dlrs in illegal profits on non-public knowledge
of a corporate restructuring.
    Israel G. Grossman, 34, who had been a pension specialist
for the New York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen and Kamin,
allegedly stole information from the firm involving the
recapitalization of Colt Industries Inc &lt;COT> last July.
    Grossman, who was arrested February 17, allegedly enabled
three individuals whom he alerted to purchase 1,006 colt call
options for 33,938 dlrs.
    July 21, the day after the Colt recapitalization was
announced, its common stock rose almost 27 points. The options
increased to a value of about 1.5 mln dlrs, according to
Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who announced the
indictment today.
    Grossman is charged with 12 counts of mail fraid and 12
counts of securities fraud. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to a maximum of 120 years in jail and fined a total of six mln
dlrs.
    Grossman resigned from the law firm following his arrest.
He is scheduled to enter a plea March 26.

<TITLE>ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV> EXPLORES UNIT SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHEVERLY, Md., March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
    The group includes senior management of Service America but
no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
    The company has agreed to permit the group and its
potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
America, it said.
    Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
off the foodservice subsidiary.
    The company said the group's review is preliminary and
there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
or, if made, accepted.
    Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
    He declined to identify the Service America officials in
the acquisition group.
    On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
office and furniture operations.
    In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
&lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.
    Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

raised to B from B-minus Valero Energy Corp's preferred stock.
    Also, the rating agency affirmed Valero's BB-minus
industrial revenue bonds and B-rated debentures. About 950 mln
dlrs of long-term debt is outstanding.
    S and P said Valero's financial flexibility would improve
as the company plans to use proceeds of roughly 760 mln dlrs
from a proposed sale of natural gas operations to reduce debt.
Pro forma debt leverage drops to about 30 pct from 67 pct at
September 30, 1986. But S and P said Valero's refining segment
has been unable to consistently generate operating profits.

<TITLE>PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Lima, march 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms
to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among
government-owned companies.
    Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others
would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,
president of the government's state company holding firm, the
national development council (conade).
     He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to
slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion
intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all
or part of the companies.
    Independent economists warn that the deficit could push
inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the
govenment target of 40-50 pct.
    Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline
with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private
investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in
eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.
    Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said
the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,
including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock
exchange.
    Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the
possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another
manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold
in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern
state of  arequipa.
    Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique
estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners
would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries
said they were out of their offices.
    Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima
stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be
sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase
stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.
    He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad
until at least july 1988.

    Dana currently carries A-2 senior debt and industrial

<TITLE>FINANCIAL TIMES LAUNCHES NEW WORLD SHARE INDEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Financial Times newspaper said it
has launched a new international share index, which represents
more than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. The
FT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,
feature a main world share index and indices plotting the
movement of share prices in different regions and individual
countries, the FT said.
    The first world share indices will be published on an
up-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of
around 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.
    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices
for UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and
published in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a
series of regional indices together with the overall world
index.
    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of
measurements against which the performance of international
fund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and
securities have been included only when direct holdings of
shares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said
to keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of
companies from the U.S. To 600.
    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -
the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.
    The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes
into account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The
gross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what
foreign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding
taxes.
    The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after
the enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity
investment in recent years.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Budget Committee Chairman
William Gray, D-Pa, said he would propose a freeze on all
spending for federal government programs for the fiscal 1988
budget to meet budget deficit targets.
    "An outlay freeze -- with no additional revenues -- produces
almost enough savings to reach the 108 billion dlr deficit
target. For fiscal 1988, this would mean total spending of just
over 1 trillion dlrs," Gray said in a statement.
    Gray said his plan would call for a freeze in spending on
each individual federal program at fiscal 1987 levels.
    He said this would mean numerous program cuts, lower
benefits for recipients of federal assistance and fewer people
being served by federal programs.
    Gray said he would make the budget freeze proposal when the
House Budget Committee begins work on the budget resolution
this Thursday. The Senate Budget Committee began work on its
budget resolution this afternoon.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO POLICY FOR OR AGAINST CERTIFICATES -- OMB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Office of Management and
Budget does not have a policy position one way or another on
whether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate
program should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.
    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's
annual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural
branch, said instead of an across the board policy for or
against certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work
very closely with USDA in determining how many certificates
should be sent out in each government farm payment.
    "Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the
Congressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and
do increase budget exposure," Landis said.
    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous
beneficial impacts.
    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price
competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the
government storage and handling costs.
    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that
they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of
the pik and roll marketing strategy.
    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under
loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference
between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan
rate.
    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added
costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the
program.
    "OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the
market, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh
the added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is
good," an OMB official told Reuters.
    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate
worth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for
wheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for
soybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit
of about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.
    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest
that an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to
the market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for
every dlr released in certificates.
    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto
the market could cause prices to drop too low and government
costs to increase too much.
    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of
certificates would be excessive.

<TITLE>UK TRADE WARY OF HIGHER EC GRAIN LEVY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community may decide to
increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its
scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88
farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye,
vice-president of the British agricultural merchants'
association UKASTA, said.
    At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy
remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed
manufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its
controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils
and fats tax are blocked
    Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy
"tooth and nail."
    However, a test case in the European Court of Justice
contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the
levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers'
organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the
end of 1987, he said.

Bridgeport Hydraulic Co subsidiary had its proposal to use land
sales proceeds to help fund capital improvements denied by the
Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control.
    Hydraulic said its proposal also called for a distribution
of the finaical benefits to its stockholders and customers.
    However, Hyraulic said the state utility commission would
consider similar requests in the future. It said the utility
commission felt its request was premature and noted  Hydraulic
did not specify parcels of land considered for sale.

<TITLE>U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Washington, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>From April through December 1986,
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
certificates has been authorized for issuance during
January-August, 1987.
    These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
    Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
more competitive on world markets, it said.
    The department said last summer, for example, certificates
were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
would have otherwise.
    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
to 50 mln bushels, it said.
    The department said government spending on farm programs in
fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
    The department said the President's budget proposals for
1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
billion dlrs.
    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
average of 1980-86, it said.
    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
years, the department said.

<TITLE>FAVOURABLE TAX TREATMENT GONE ON CERTAIN UK LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Inland Revenue ruling accompanying
today's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment
on certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a
"nightmare" of practical application, banking sources said.
    This is because banks will only be able to offset the tax
credit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they
receive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific
loan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks
profits as a whole.
    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a
nightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.
    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change
are those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin
America. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were
involved expect to suggest it was a "sizable number."
    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made
on or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest
arising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the
measures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.
    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of
withholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce
interest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue
to the U.K. Treasury.
    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the
subsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and
bring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas
competitors.
    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the
Treausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over
time from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.
    But while compliance with the new measures could
necessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return
to the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.
    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans
contains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the
tax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent
the loans would and could be changed.
    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland
Revenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these
loans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a
minimum.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Pete Domenici, a main sponsor
of legislation to set an oil import fee, said the
administration's energy security report was based on flawed
economic assumptions.
    The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into
account the last few weeks' drop in domestic oil production in
its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers.
The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the
fee would reduce tax revenues. "A five dlr (per barrel) oil
import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and
investment, " and raise revenues, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Upcoming changes being considered in
the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan
programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator
for USDA's state and county operations, said the following
changes are under consideration by USDA.
    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for
wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.
    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under
consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not
made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain
in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next
year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans
partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop
program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.
    He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus
under the Conservation Reserve Program.

    Klopfenstein said that CCC will not be able to relocate

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. FARM GROUPS OPPOSE POLICY CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Seven major U.S. farm groups took
the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging
congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law.
    Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee
Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a
statement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaul
the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop
marketing year."
    The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau
Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's
Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton
Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice
Producers Legislative Group.
    The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm
bill "so the law might have its intended impact of making
agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the
same time maintaining farm income."
    "We strongly believe American farmers now need
predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to
have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing
decisions," the groups said.

    The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adopted

petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import
taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers.
    Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to
compete with the Japanese. It said President Reagan imposed the
tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the
administration the Japanese were eroding the U.S. motorcycle
industry by flooding the market with its own models.
    Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of
the heavyweight motorcycle to 19.4 pct in 1986 from a record
low 12.5 pct in 1983.

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN PLANNING MINISTER RESIGNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Planning Minister Joao Sayad
resigned, a presidential spokesman said.
    His resignation was accepted during a meeting with 
President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.
    No official reasons for the resignation were immediately
available, but sources close to the government said Sayad had
pressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp government
spending cuts to combat inflation.
    Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro accepted
the proposals, the sources said.
    Sayad was one of the architects of last year's "Plano
Cruzado" program, which froze prices, ended widespread
indexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzado
currency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pct
annual inflation rate.
    After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan was
unable to withstand the inflationary pressures of booming
consumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first two
months of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.
    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus
caused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension
of interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial
debt.
    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new
measures to correct the economy would be announced within a
month, although he gave no further details.
    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said 
Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to
get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the
Brazilian cabinet.
    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earlier
today the government was considering a suggestion by the Chief
of Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a new
multi-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's
current economic difficulties.

established in June 1986 and allowed members of either program
to earn miles and redeem points for rewards from the other

<TITLE>CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kansas Republican Congressman Pat
Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export
enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.
    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,
Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and
should also include the Soviet Union.
    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue
of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan
administration recently because Secretary of State George
Shultz was out of the country.
    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.
Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service
administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply
to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.
    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the
USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.
    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.
    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed on
an eep to the Soviet Union."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pfizer Inc said it expects to file a
new drug application in the U.S. and in other markets this year
for sertraline, a treatment for depression.
    In its annual report, Pfizer said that in addition to the
drug's anti-depressant action, sertraline is currently
undergoing studies to explore its ability to promote weight
loss. Company officials were not immediately available to
comment further.
    Eli Lilly and Co's &lt;LLY> Prozac, an antidepressant awaiting
marketing approval, has shown promise in promoting weight loss.
    Pfizer also said it plans to file for U.S. marketing
approval for certrizine, a "novel" antihistamine for hay fever,
and other allergic reactions.
    In 1986, Pfizer earned 660 mln dlrs or 3.90 dlrs per share
on revenues of 4.5 billion dlrs.

"hundreds" of its employees returned to work at its Dakota
City, Nebraska beef processing plant without incident.
    Last week, Iowa Beef said it would lift a lockout in effect
at the plant since mid-December, which affected 2,800 members
of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
    Both union and non-union meatpackers who returned to work,
agreed to comply with Iowa Beef's last contract offer.
    "Start-up went well today and operations will continue to
pick up as employees return and others are hired," according to
a company statement. Picketing UFCWU members at the plant did
not disrupt operations, a company spokesman said.
    "Our employees are asked to continue to return to work at
8AM unless otherwise notified," he said.
    Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp, said
it is beginning to take applications for permanent positions at
the plant.

<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;John Labatt Ltd> is considering
expansion in Europe, but has made no decisions as to strategy,
according to spokesman I.C. Ferrier.
    The company opened a London office about six months ago,
and "we are prepared to invest in that area to see how one might
do business over there," he said.
    But the company has not decided whether it might open
breweries, buy a European company or whether European expansion
is feasible at all, he added.
   Labatt feels Europe is a logical step for the company, since
it is doing "reasonably well" in the U.S. and "there aren't too
many other places" to expand profitably, Ferrier said.
    In Canada, Labatt is the leading brewer, with about 41 pct
of the market, according to market analysts. &lt;Molson Companies
Ltd> holds about 32 pct and &lt;Carling O'Keefe Ltd> has 23 pct,
analysts estimate.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>COURT BLOCKS INJUNCTION SOUGHT AGAINST COASTAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge ruled that
&lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> can not seek an injunction in
Texas State court to block Coastal Corp &lt;CGP> from presenting a
plan of reorganization in TransAmerican's bankruptcy
proceeding.
    However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled that
TransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit against
Coastal that alleges the Houston based gas company is
attempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texas
gas reserve and pipeline system.
    Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans to
maintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings that began in 1983.
    After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican,
said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking
2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.
    Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted to
replace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan paying
secured creditors in full with a plan of its own.
    "They're not going to pay any money under their plan,
they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profit
to the creditors," Nabors said.
    He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted to
the Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrs
annually for seven years.
    TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs in
debts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on the
dollar to unsecured creditors.
     A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecured
creditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.
    Transamerican said it is the second largest producer of
natural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet
and more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
    Coastal, one of the nation's largest gas producers, earned
71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>LYNG SAID TO HAVE NO COMMENT ON USSR WHEAT EEP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain
exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a
position to comment on their request that the Reagan
administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union,
according to participants in today's meeting.
    "He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk
about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the
Soviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National
Council of Farmer Cooperatives.
    Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be
identified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.
    Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,
Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union Equity
Cooperative Exchange, the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, among
others, participants said.
    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under
Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.
    Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," and
said he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng's
part at not being able to respond more positively to the
group's urging.
    A grain industry representative said some participants were
"puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the
cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
    "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the
idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"
this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring
to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
    This official said there was not a significant amount of
pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP
offer to Moscow.
    Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an
offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone
calls from lawmakers on the subject.
    But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,
rather than an absence of political pressure, might have
restrained Lyng.

<TITLE>U.S. OTC MARKET PROPOSES ONE-SHARE, ONE-VOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Crosson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of Securities
Dealers said all stock exchanges should require that listed
companies adopt a "one-share, one-vote" rule, but with a few
exceptions.
    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD
President Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to be
the first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certain
exceptions.
    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. If
a voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then
the commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,"
the NASD said.
    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the
OTC offered only one class of stock.
    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a
uniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal
voting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.
    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not
have voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled
out to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from
turning voting shares into non-voting shares, without
shareholder approval, Parrillo said.
    "A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been
construed by some to be an abusive practice involving the use
of stock with other than full voting rights," the association
said in the statement.
    Exceptions would include:
    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts
connected with the company's capital structure are clearly
spelled out in the prospectus.
    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition
or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied
by detailed proxy material.
    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of
stock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority
of independent directors on the board approve the move. The
NYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual
classes to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.
    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual
class shares where those with superior voting rights are not
resalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect
prevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Malaysian government has
deposited 405 mln ringgit with the financially troubled
&lt;Cooperative Central Bank Bhd> (CCB) since last October, Deputy
Finance Minister Sabaruddin Chik said.
    He told Parliament the government has always supported CCB.
The statement is the government's first acknowledgment that it
has put money into the bank.
    CCB's management board has been changed twice since last
June. It reported pretax profit of 10.57 mln ringgit in the
half-year to June 30, 1986, down from 19.83 mln ringgit a year
earlier. The bank did not release its net results.
    New bank chairman Nik Hussein Abdul Rahman has said he
asked police to investigate possible wrongdoing and
malpractices related to loans made mainly to property
developers and politicians.
    The bank had a paid-up capital of 52.16 mln ringgit and
deposits totalling 1.67 billion at June 30 last year.
    Malaysia's Central Bank has rescued two large commercial
banks, United Asian Bank Bhd and Perwira Habib Bank (Malaysia)
Bhd, since late 1986.

<TITLE>PAPER SAYS U.S. MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration will
consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive
industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York
Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.
    "I think there's a strong sentiment here that some
industries are not totally up for grabs," the paper quoted the
official as saying.
    "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and
computer companies," said the official, who the newspaper said
was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd
&lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.
    The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and
industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan
administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition
in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.
    Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought
the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger
Ltd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could
have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for
vital technology.
    The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had
come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.
    "Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have
to be some exceptions for the national interest," Baldrige was
quoted as saying.
    The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to
bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency
policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's
Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security
Council.

<TITLE>YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN'S FAVOURITE HORROR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>"Endaka," the strong yen, has usurped
"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horror
story.
    The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two
years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon,
the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs
a month.
    But "endaka," like many Japanese products, is for foreign
consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.
    "It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to
the cost of living," said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old
Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo.
    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40
hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the
language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet
two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of
Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has
managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.
    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating
out once a day.
    "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes
with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso
soup, rice and tea," although she takes only coffee for
breakfast and a sandwich for dinner.
    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents
see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by
foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.
    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the
price to bring over the best people needed to back up their
push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.
    "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and
trade down. It's not reasonable," said a spokesman for
International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports
Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.
    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business
travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions
Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on
average more than 300 dlrs a day.
    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,
many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to
visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.
    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 11.5
pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.
    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by
curtailing shopping, it said.
    To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist
Bureau prepared a pamphlet, "Economical Travel in Japan."
    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced
business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public
baths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in their
daily lives."
    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's
Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.
    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding
English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,
berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese "flop house."
    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for
work. "Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll
splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited
pizza for at least two hours."
    Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. "I had to
spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat," he said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES SOCIAL SECURITY TO BUY SAN MIGUEL SHRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines' Social Security System
(SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer
&lt;San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del
Rosario said.
    He told reporters the government organisation had expressed
interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to
invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a
share.
    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
    The block is split between class A and class B stock.
    SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
Soriano, del Rosario said.
    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
unidentified foreign purchasers.
    He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
shares.
    Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the
real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former
chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of
deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, May 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A very strong earthquake which struck
southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three,
cracked walls and cut telephone lines, authorities said.
    The quake, at 0336 GMT, registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to
two metres high, they said.
    A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck
overturned, and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved
in, police said. Two primary school children were hurt by
flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom. The
extent of their injuries was not immediately known.
    A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki,
one of the worst hit areas, said walls cracked all over town.
    Weather officials told Reuters the quake's epicentre was 50
km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga, on
Kyushu's eastern coast.
    Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along
the Kyushu coast to return to port, and dispatched a fleet of
six search boats to see them safely back.
    Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and
all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution,
police said.

<TITLE>INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia has issued licences to
traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of
cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,
Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.
    "We have given permission for a small amount of imports to
prevent a shortage during Ramadan," he said. He gave no figures
for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would
come from Malaysia.
    Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,
earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.
    Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders
in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around
135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.
    Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest
Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and
have large meals after sunset.
    Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of
1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,
against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.
    Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not
explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.

<TITLE>NY TIMES SAYS IRAN ARMS MONEY WENT TO KIDNAPPERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Millions of dollars in proceeds from
the sale of U.S. Arms to Iran were funneled to groups holding
American hostages in Lebanon, the New York Times said.
    The newspaper, quoting U.S. Officials and others, said
Iranian arms merchant Manucher Ghorbanifar, who served as a
middleman in the sales, deposited two to three mln dlrs in the
Swiss bank account of the Global Islamic Movement.
    The newspaper said the movement was a funding arm for
various terrorist groups in Lebanon, including the Party of God
or Hizbollah group which has been reported to be holding
American hostages but has consistently denied the reports.
    The money was described as ransom by American and other
associates of Ghorbanifar, the Times said, adding that an
unnamed American official called it "payments for services
rendered." The newspaper said the payments suggested the money
may have been used to cover expenses incurred by the hostages'
kidnappers.
    The newspaper also said that according to some accounts,
Ghorbanifar paid Iranian officials and various groups as much
as 10 mln dlrs. It said up to six mln dlrs went to Hojatoleslam
Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, and his
family.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JEFF STEARNS, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>More U.S. And European firms will be
falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
Banks, steel and other businesses.
    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's
biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
components for supercomputers.
    Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
banking, the takeover specialists said.
    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
    "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal," a
takeover specialist at one trading company said.
    Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
the specialists said.
    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
barriers against Japanese exports.
    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
investment opportunity.
    "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
the recent economic factors have become a driving force," said a
banking industry source.
    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
added.
    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
but its graphic arts-related businesses.
    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
by the Japanese, the trading company official says. "Japanese
people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
deals." But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. "This is
a healthy progression."
    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
    "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
large U.S. Or European corporation," one banker said. "They will
expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
Japanese business."
    A foreign merchant banker also noted, "There are not many
mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
deals there have already been done."
    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
Japanese companies, the specialists said.
    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
high-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technology
and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
from that trend," one takeover specialist said.
    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali
al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC
member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the
13-nation group.
    Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states,
without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to
them. Some of them are producing less."
    Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab
Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its
quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still
pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of
this year.
    Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but
an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected
its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems
marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.
    OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six
months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a
barrel from February 1.

Lawson said he expected British interest rates to fall soon in
response to his fiscal 1987/88 budget, but he did not say by
how much.
    "I would be very surprised if there is not a very early
further fall in interest rates," Lawson said in a radio

    Analysts said they foresaw U.K. Base rates falling as early
as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawson's
announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing
requirement in fiscal 1987/88 and 1988/89 was to fall to 1.0
pct of GDP, or some four billion stg.
    British banks' base lending rates fell a half percentage

<TITLE>CHINA TO CUT EXCESSIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>China said it will continue its efforts
to cut excessive capital investment, and noted policies to cool
the economy have so far failed.
    Fixed asset investment grew 16.7 pct to 296.7 billion yuan
in 1986, outstripping energy and raw materials growth, the
China Daily quoted Zhou Daojiong, president of the People's
Construction Bank of China, as saying.
    Over 160,000 projects costing 895 billion yuan are now
under construction, and will absorb 60 pct of the funds
earmarked for investment under China's current five-year
economic plan (1986-1990), he said.
    The state-run construction bank will review all investment
projects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt those
deemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.
    Over 20 billion yuan of unauthorised spending by local
governments or enterprises were partly responsible for the
overheated rate of investment, he said.
    Another two or three years of measures to curb excessive
investment were needed to bring it under control, Zhou said.

<TITLE>THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Vithoon Amorn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials of five Thai commercial banks
are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
interest rates, banking sources said.
    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
on the money market.
    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
rates, they said.
    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
sources said.
    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
in bank deposits.
    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
bank capital.
    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
    Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
of surplus funds to the local money market.

<TITLE>CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HK>
forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
the year-earlier period.
    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747
freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.
    It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit
to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14
cents a share.
    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance
charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.
    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft
deliveries in 1986.
    However, the company said in a statement good returns from
funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
other borrowing.
    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel
prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in
1985.
    Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last
year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre
travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But
passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.
    The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in
total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in
revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.
    Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now
50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by
&lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>.

<TITLE>GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Global trading of yen bond futures is
just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon
on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)
and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.
    "Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of
overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of
global trading of yen bond futures," said Katsuyuki Okayasu,
general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.
    "But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus
for the LIFFE yen bond futures market," said Tetsuya Dezuka,
deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan
Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in
London.
    Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends
basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets
overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,
dealers said.
    Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around
140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.
    An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on
mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond
futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous
12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was
made with yen bond futures trading in mind.
    LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures
after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last
December.
    But futures markets will never take root unless they are
backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers
said.
    Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now
stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-
linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.
    "Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their
financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are
engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"
Dezuka said.
    The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese
securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And
U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's
growth, dealers said.
    Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be
promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this
year, securities managers said.
    The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond
futures contract, they said.
    The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading
futures of designated foreign government debt securities not
located in the issuing country.
    Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has
decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New
York as early as April.
    CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of
April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura
Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still
obstacles to trading on the London market.
    "Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are
major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE," said Koki
Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's
bond administration division.
    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese
securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE
on these matters.
    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with
coupon payment of either March and September, or June and
December from April 1, matching futures delivery months.
    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and
December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not
match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned
by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities
managers said.
    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of
bonds with matching months increases to over several billion
yen, bond managers said.
    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are
expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low
interest rates, they said.
    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to
be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash
issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of
1987.

<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg.
    Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could
be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base
lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in
the discount market.
    Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today,
possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which
the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed
by three billion stg.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and
bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg
and 20 mln stg respectively.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add some 140 mln stg to the system today.

<TITLE>FRN TRADING SEEN RETURNING TO MORE NORMAL PATTERNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conditions on the floating rate note
market appeared to be returning gradually to normal today with
prices static to a little better generally, dealers said.
    The market was showing limited signs of recovery from the
collapse in trading last night and the calmer tone was
reinforced this morning as the first significant retail orders
for some time emerged, one senior FRN trader noted.
    In fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmer
with euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullish
trend and activity in dollar straight and ECU-denominated bonds
also picking up slowly.
    Although a handful of FRN market makers were expected to
remain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted a
tangible return of retail interest from the Far East, lured
back by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.
    "We are seeing from Singapore, and from Japan clients keen
to use up their quotas for purchase of particular instruments
before the end of the fiscal year," the senior trader added.
    Any investors not buying to their full limit would run the
risk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.
    However, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was in
demand with U.S. Bank sector paper largely ignored.
    Prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by an
average of 10 basis points in early trading but FRN dealers
cautioned that the mood was still nervous.
    "If prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is more
than well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again,"
commented another FRN market source at a large Japanese house.
    The other sector commanding market attention today was
eurosterling, which soared in line with U.K. Government bonds.
    Both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound and
renewed buying by U.K. Institutions following Chancellor of the
Exchequer's Nigel Lawson's well-received budget yesterday.
    "This was definitely a budget for lower sterling interest
rates," said a sterling analyst at a U.K. Merchant bank.
    "It has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looks
good to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tap
the eurosterling markets now," he added.
    News that next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
will be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0
billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets.
The government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged markets
will create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upward
pressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.
    This could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, as
long as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts --
often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.
    Bullish predictions on the U.K.'s general economic health
were also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.
    Market sources said attention would now switch to
monitoring the fortunes of the ruling Conservative party in
opinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.
    Although several new sterling deals are expected, in early
trading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30
mln convertible deal for British Land Co Plc.
    Other new deals this morning reflected the recent primary
market trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issues
although the currency sectors were busy.
    Hot on the heels of yesterday's two Canadian dollar issues
was a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for Chrysler Credit Canada,
guaranteed by Chrysler Finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/2 pct.
    A 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for Associates Corp
of North America paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992. A
similar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a
Scandinavian borrower. Details were not immediately available.

<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Singapore government has taken
over 82 mln dlrs worth of Goodwood Park Hotel Ltd shares and
loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,
Khoo Teck Puat, banking sources said.
    Khoo is a major shareholder of the &lt;National Bank of Brunei
Bhd> (NBB), which closed in November after the Brunei
authorities alleged 90 pct of its loans of 1.3 billion Brunei
dlrs had been extended to Khoo-related firms without
documentation or guarantee.
    The Goodwood securities are now held by the Commercial
Affairs Investigation Department, the banking sources said. The
department declined to comment.
    The government move is aimed at protecting Goodwood's
minority shareholders and securing Goodwood deposits at the
NBB, the banking sources said.
    Goodwood had a total of 87.3 mln dlrs in fixed deposits,
bank balances and accrued interest due from NBB as of last
November, according to Goodwood's annual report.

<TITLE>TURNER AND NEWALL SEEKS 71.7 MLN STG IN RIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turner and Newall Plc said it planned to
raise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of
36.15 mln shares.
    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's
price which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.
    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,
which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a
result of the takeover of &lt;AE Plc>.
    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln
stg from 39.6 mln previously.
    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of
some 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings
of some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end
had risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The
rights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further
development through investment and acquisition.
    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after
a long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened
the group's position in the automotive components and
engineering materials sectors.
    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of
27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months
previously.
   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until
December 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986
results.
    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward
to taking advantage of the opportunities available.
   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from
Zimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local
currency against the dollar.

contract from the U.S. Air Force to repair and service landing
gear and airframe parts of General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD.N> F-16
and McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD.N> F-4 jet fighters.
    The one-year contract, worth 1.3 mln ringgit, was signed
recently and work is expected to begin soon, an Airod spokesman
told Reuters.
    Airod is a joint venture between Lockheed Corp &lt;LK.N> unit
&lt;Lockheed Aircraft Service International> and &lt;Aerospace
Industries Malaysia>
    Airod, which was set up in 1985, has a paid-up capital of
5.6 mln ringgit, the spokesman said.
    He said that under the contract, jet parts from U.S. Air
Force bases in the Philippines, Japan and South Korea would be
sent to Airod for servicing and repair. If the Air Force was
satisfied with its performance, the contract could be extended,
he said. Airod now services some Royal Malaysian Air Force and
Indonesian Air Force aircraft, he said.
    Aerospace Industries is equally owned by the Malaysian
government, Malaysian Airline System &lt;MAIM.SI> and &lt;United

of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities
for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.
    Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to
produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.
    It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the
manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate
about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.
    The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three
weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government
agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over
by state-owned banks.
    Official sources said Toyota's application was likely to be
approved.
    Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20
years, &lt;Delta Motor Corp>, in 1984 because the local company
was suffering financial difficulties. PNB later foreclosed on
Delta's assets.

in the Government's public sector borrowing target for 1987/88
to four billion stg.
    Many in the market had expected a full one point cut in
base rates today but some were not surprised by the
authorities' caution, dealers added.

tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
scandal at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the VEBA sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
    A banker involved in the VEBA placement said "Nothing has
changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
place in the second half of March."
    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

<TITLE>SOVIET ECONOMIST SAYS PRODUCTION FIGURES PADDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leading Soviet economist said the
practice of padding figures was significantly inflating the
country's industrial production data.
    "According to the information of state monitoring organs,
the padding of figures makes up one-and-a-half to three per
cent of the volume of production," Alexei Sergeyev told the
official newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya.
    "In my opinion, it is significantly higher," Sergeyev, who
works at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academy
of Sciences, said.
    Most Western economists have for years allowed for a
certain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics for
industrial production.
    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually in
raw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for work
which was not in fact performed.
    He said the elimination of figure-padding and other
malpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay for
the Soviet Union's social development program up to the year
2000.

<TITLE>SONY FORESEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> group net income is
expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing
director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
    Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
mln due to lower exports to China.
    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>NV KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>
is "absolutely not" negotiating a takeover of U.S. Regional
carrier Air Atlanta, a KLM spokeswoman said in a comment on an
article in the leading Dutch evening paper NRC Handelsblad.
    "U.S. Law requires that at least 75 pct of shares in a U.S.
Airline be owned by American firms or persons," the spokeswoman
added.
    The newspaper said that Air Atlanta, which flies to 11 U.S.
Cities, has a fleet of five Boeing jets with passenger capacity
of 110 and employs 400 people, is making losses.
    She said KLM had started talks with Vendex International NV
&lt;VENN.AS> on their jointly owned courier service XP Express
Parcel Systems, but declined to confirm an NRC Handelsblad
report saying it wanted to buy the Vendex stake in XP.
    KLM said last week it is negotiating a minority stake in
British courier service &lt;IML Air Services Group Ltd>, a
subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L>,
to strengthen its position in the fast-growing worldwide
door-to-door delivery market.
    The KLM spokeswoman said she expected further announcements

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BABCOCK RIGHTS ISSUE PRICED AT 165 MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Babcock AG
&lt;DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a
two-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal
capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to
April eight, it added.
    Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a
close of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged
three mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last
week that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.
These shares will be placed with institutional investors.
    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,
which share market analysts said was likely be used partly to
finance expansion, especially in environment technology.
    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major
Frankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to
bring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered
heavy losses in the early 1980s.
    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these
losses, which were due to problems linked with three major
contracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net
loss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.
    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its
results in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose
from the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.
    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the
pricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was
unfortunate.
    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in
VEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely
2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with
a large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener
insurance group.
    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has
generally put pressure on West German stocks which have also
suffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.
    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with
Iran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since
1975.
    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the
market took the news calmly. Analysts said today the
combination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not
have a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct
placement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors
both in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG URGES U.K. ENTRY INTO EMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German finance minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg suggested that the U.K. Should join the European
Monetary System (EMS) and also urged some member countries to
abandon their dual currency structures.
    Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee for
a Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS.
    He said, "One failing of the EMS is important countries,
like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should give
up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations."
    EMS member Belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial"
franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct
against other member currencies, compared with a permitted
fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.
    According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the finance
minister also urged greater convergence of economic and
financial policies among European countries.
    He added that monetary stability should be a priority for
European countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, he
said it was wrong to presume that a "permanent devaluation" was
the answer to economic problems.
    Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the
dollar in 1985. "But an overshooting in the other direction now
brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And
other countries whose currencies have declined," he added.
    He said such a development could also produce further
burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement
last month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the
dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he
said.

<TITLE>ZAIRE AND IMF IN ECONOMIC RESCUE TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jean-Loup Fievet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KINSHASA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks are underway between financially
troubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed
at rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in
sub-Saharan Africa.
    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a
compromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks
enabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of
cash.
    For its part the government is expected to increase
budgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract
foreign investors, the sources said.
    "Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled
out in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial
political and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors are
bound to come to terms soon," a Western diplomat told Reuters.
    "The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF
assistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's
strategic minerals fall into communist hands," the diplomat
said.
    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it
would limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to
10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.
    The government also announced an end to the floating
exchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed
parity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic
adjustments.
    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export
revenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the
copper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and
often extravagant investment projects.
    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth
largest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for
two-thirds of its export earnings.
    "A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing
everything for the sake of servicing its external debt,"
President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he
announced his government's decision.
    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that "one does
not feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one
toward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire," he
told diplomats.
    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed
austerity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital
without receiving appropriate financing from abroad.
    Economists said that since the large devaluation of the
zaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net
outflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.
    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few
years reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross
National Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the
world, banking sources said.
    Mobutu accused the IMF of "strangling" his country at an
October meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people
could not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.
    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the
IMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,
failed to materialise last year,
    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and
boosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,
    - substantial, additional financial help from the country's
traditional donors.
    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at
curbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed
spending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western
creditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.
    As a result, the overall economic and financial situation
improved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from
100 pct in 1983.
    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living
standards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread
discontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.
    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between
20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,
despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced
last May.
    The World Bank has released in the last two months half of
a previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent
27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport
system.
    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading
partner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to
ease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts
for industry.
    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the
way for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting
of the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO ADOPT ITS LARGEST-EVER PROVISIONAL BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A parliamentary boycott by opposition
members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever
provisional budget, finance ministry officials said.
    The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of
fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040
billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.
    An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition
parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented
passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year
ending March 31.
    The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliament
on March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls for
economic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by the
yen's sharp rise, officials said.
    It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for public
works, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for such
works in the full budget. Traditionally, a provisional budget
covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.
    The government also expects the budget to meet pressure
from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic
demand, they said.
    The budget includes expenditures for a program to create
300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officials
said.
    They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary
general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials
yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming
as possible.
    Economists said confidence of opposition members in their
campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their
success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could
lead to even further delays in passing the full budget.
    The result may be that the government will have to delay
its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in
April, economists said.
    That package is expected to include a plan to carry out
more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first
half of the fiscal year, a government official said.
    Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested
Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April
because of the sales tax confrontation. Nakasone hopes to meet
President Reagan to prepare for the economic summit of seven
major industrial democracies in June, they added.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, May 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A very strong earthquake that struck
southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three,
cracked walls and cut telephone lines, authorities said.
    The quake, at 0336 GMT, registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to
two metres high, they said.
    A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck
overturned, and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved
in, police said. Two primary school children were hurt by
flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom. The
extent of their injuries was not immediately known.
    A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki,
one of the worst hit areas, said walls cracked all over town.
    Weather officials told Reuters the quake's epicentre was 50
km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga, on
Kyushu's eastern coast.
    Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along
the Kyushu coast to return to port, and dispatched a fleet of
six search boats to see them safely back.
    Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and
all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution,
police said.

<TITLE>LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said he was content with the current level of sterling and
welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in
British bank base lending rates to 10 pct.
    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to
declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in
financial markets might push for big moves quickly.
    He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't
think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of
"gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy.
    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates
were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled
yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the
key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of
GDP.
    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made
this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were
"perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain.
    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply
aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six
pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set
no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.
    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),
Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before
the next election."
    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS
membership under constant review. But he would not indicate
what the chief considerations for this were for the government.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a
decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of
the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on
other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.
    Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave
of election fever" in Britain, he added:  "It is more likely that
there will be an election this year" than not.
    He said he supported an early election only because it
would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a
full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson
said.
    The government, which has been in power since 1979, must
call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either
a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.
    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88
"was the right balance, economically and politically," he said.
    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate
of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted
that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have
allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.
    But it was being praised today by political analysts as a
shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not
be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe
the electorate.
    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much
the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion
stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.
    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson
stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) -
they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had
no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.
    But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in
the level of government borrowing, he added.
    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively
high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in
Britain.
    He said conditions created by London's role as a leading
financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be
higher in real terms than in other countries.
    Three factors had caused the higher level in relative
interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.
    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest
rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.
    He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused
by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.
     Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of
low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.
    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent
financial centre, because it was more international in
character and more favourably placed in time zones than New
York or Tokyo.

<TITLE>DIXONS HAS 56 PCT OF CYCLOPS CORP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dixons Group Plc &lt;DXNS.L> said its
tender offer for all of the common shares in &lt;Cyclops Corp> of
the U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted
approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.
    This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares
on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned,
Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted
outstanding shares.
    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all
the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common
stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25
dlrs each.
    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the
fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17
this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over
the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L>.
    Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's
close of 380p.
    On Friday, &lt;CYACQ Corp>, an investor group formed by
Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it
would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares
to 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it
with confidential information given to Dixons and if it were
satisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or
expenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded
or proved invalid.
    Audio/Video's offer is scheduled to expire March 20.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>An on-off parliamentary boycott has
forced Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to adopt a
provisional budget, government officials said.
    Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's
plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system.
    The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over
Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it
impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the
start of the fiscal year on April 1, government officials said.

off the Iranian coast in attacks last night and early today.
    The planes "dealt accurate and effective blows to both
maritime targets before they returned safely to base," a
military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA.
    There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from
Persian Gulf shipping sources.
    The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8,
when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran's
Kharg island oil export terminal.
    Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship
had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile.
    They said there were no injuries on board and the ship
headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power
after the fire was put out.
    The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime
extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's inflation and interest
rates should decline and the balance of payments improve
significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the
Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.
    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue
that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic
product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct
drop forecast in December.
    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in
the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.
    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and
September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and
the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax
and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.
    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to
change, it said.
    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is
forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in
calendar 1986, it said.
    "Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for
reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are
also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of
payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls
away," the NZIER said.
    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20
and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the
second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term
rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.
    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and
the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.
    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the
early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on
the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a
basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.
    "A marked improvement in the balance of payments is
forecast," the NZIER said. "The current account deficit is
expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in
1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88."
    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32
billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and
3.33 billion in 1985/86.
    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion
dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87
billion in 1985/86.
    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure
of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.
    "Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to
contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of
payments and the rate of inflation ...," the NZIER said.
    "Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand
economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well
for future prospects."

<TITLE>ICCO MEMBERS ACCEPT BUFFER STOCK PRINCIPLES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise
proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further
negotiation, delegates said.
    The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive
Director Kobena Erbynn, who wrote up the draft compromise, to
flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a
representative group of delegates, they said.
    The working group broke up for the day, into a smaller
group of five producers and five consumers to discuss
administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to
hammer out buffer stock rules details, delegates said.
    Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be
ironed out. "Whenever we start getting into details the clouds
gather," one delegate said.
    Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the
buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early
tomorrow, delegates said.
    The principles of the draft proposal included establishing
an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted
price system, a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa
that can be bought, and differentials to be paid for different
varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock, delegates said.

<TITLE>AFG &lt;AFG>, WAGNER/BROWN BID FOR GENCORP &lt;GY></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;General Partners>, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
for 100 dlrs a share.
    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
shares.
    General Partners said it would set up voting trust
arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
broadcasting subsidiary.
    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
minority shareholders to elect directors.
    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
&lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
for 1.66 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
payments and political contributions.
    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

<TITLE>FRANCE PROTESTS OVER CANADA'S FISHING BAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>France today protested over Canada's
decision to declare its ports off limits to French fishing
vessels and bar further fishing by France off Newfoundland.
    A foreign ministry statement described yesterday's decision
by Canada as "unjustified and contrary to international law and
commitments made by Canada," and called on Ottawa authorities to
reexamin their position.
    Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday said
that any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, off
the south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.
    "The French government strongly protests against the closing
of Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against the
fishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank," the ministry
statement added.
    The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latest
episode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have a
negative effect on fishing negotiations currently held between
Ottawa and Paris.
    Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their
6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.
    In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishing
accord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing France
to increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.
    Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to refer
differences over a maritime boundary zone near the French
islands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to international
arbitration.

billion dlr suit against it by &lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp>
in Texas state court is frivolous and without merit.
    The company said it intends toi proceed with filing a
reorganization plan for TransAmerican with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Houston.
    Yesterday afternoon, the bankruptcy court issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting TransAmerican and
Coastal from taking any action in any court that would
interfere with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
    Yesterday's bankruptcy court ruling affirmed Coastal's
rights as a TransAmerican creditor to file a reorganization
plan for TransAmerican.
    TransAmerican's suit alleges that Coastla attempted to
unlawfully gain control of TransAmerican's Texas natural gas
reserves and pipeline system.
    TransAmerican's bankruptcy proceedings began in 1983.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Franz-Josef Ebel, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is likely to steer a
steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in
credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central
bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.
    "There is no need for action," Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.
    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last
month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money
stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target
zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.
    One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf
two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only
indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.
    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to
further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.
    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to
stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade
deficit.
    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also
precluded a further cut in official interest rates.
    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5
pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.
    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank
council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money
supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.
But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.
    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained
stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to
return to within the target range later this year.
    "The special factors which boosted money supply growth last
year are disappearing," one economist said.
    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986
was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.
    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic
credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock
growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.
    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope
for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.
    Money market dealers said period rates remained little
changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.
    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95
yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.
    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on
behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But
rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect
of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for
the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.
    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities
repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in
rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned
banks.
    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown
the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.
    One dealer said, "If the central bank wanted lower interest
rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."
    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve
assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on
Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of
March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.

<TITLE>U.S. REAL GNP ROSE 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Gross National Product,
after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised
annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise
estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
    The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged
the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of
1986 over 1985.
    The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the
department said.
    The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending
decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an
increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after
a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports
decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an
increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.

<TITLE>JAPAN TELECOM MERGER COULD INVOLVE U.K.,U.S. FIRMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless PLC &lt;CAWL.L> and the
Pacific Telesis group &lt;PAC.N> may take part in a proposed
merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's
international telecommunications market, a senior industry
official said.
    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with
the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a
news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums
agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to
participate in the new merged firm.
    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only
one private company should enter the market.
    The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital Communications
Planning Inc> (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),
were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.
    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged
consortium at less than three pct and added that even the
largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh and
Co.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while
Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointly
hold 13 pct .
    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several
firms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T>  belong to both.
    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger
agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the
government on having only one private consortium as two
companies might invest "excessive" amounts.
    He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this
week.

advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an
acquisition worth "some hundreds of billions of lire" in the
European agro-industrial sector, a company spokesman told
Reuters.
    The spokesman declined to identify the other party or
parties involved in talks, or whether a complete takeover was
under discussion, but said an Italian newspaper report that
Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for
13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U.S. Group
CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> was incorrect.
    The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by
Ferruzzi but that the company's attention at the moment was
"decisively in another direction."
    The spokesman, responding to a report in the Italian
economic daily Il Sole-24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a
possible bid for the CPC plants, told Reuters his company hoped
to conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months.
    The spokesman said that since the U.K. Government last
month blocked Ferruzzi's bid to acquire &lt;British Sugar Plc>,
the company had been looking at other investment opportunities.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Profits of U.S. corporations, after
tax liabilities, increased 8.3 billion dlrs, or 6.1 pct, in the
fourth quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 144.2

    The increase was the largest since the third quarter of
1983, when profits rose 11.4 pct and followed a 5.5 pct rise in
the third quarter of 1986.
    For the full year 1986, profits after tax were 2.5 billion
dlrs, or 1.9 pct, higher than in 1985 at a total of 133.9
billion dlrs, the department said.
    The department also estimated corporate profits to reflect
retroactive provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    It said profits after tax fell 11.2 billion dlrs in the
fourth quarter after a decline of 10.3 billion dlrs in the
third quarter.
    Profits before taxes and from current production rose 2.8
pct to 310.4 billion dlrs after rising three pct in the third
quarter.
    Profits tax liability rose to 114.6 billion dlrs in the

<TITLE>MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yeoh May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's state oil company Petronas
will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
May 1, trade sources said.
    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
further production cutbacks, the sources said.
    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month
for sale through tender, the sources said.
    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the
reduced scale of production, they said.

at Calcutta port after four days of industrial action by local
seamen, a spokesman for the shipowners' association INSA said.
    The dispute has prevented local crewmen signing on and off,
but has not affected foreign ships with international crews
docking at Calcutta, which exports tea and jute and imports
machinery, crude oil and petroleum products, the spokesman
said.
    Foreign ships may also suffer if dock workers join the
action, he said. The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) has
asked its ships to avoid the port until the dispute is over,
National Union of Seafarers in India president Leo Barnes said.

<TITLE>COOPERVISION &lt;EYE> DELAYS ANNUAL MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>CooperVision Inc said it has
delayed its annual meeting to June 22 from May 14 to allow its
board to review possible recapitalization options before the
meeting.
    CooperVision today reported first quarter net income of
64.6 mln dlrs, after a 175.2 mln dlr pretax gain from the sale
of its ophthalmic business to Johnson and Johnson &lt;JNJ> for 260
mln dlrs in cash and a 17.9 mln dlr posttax charge from a debt
repurchase.  Sales were 94.4 mln dlrs.  A year earlier it
earned 7,300,000 dlrs after a 120,000 dlr loss from
discontinued operations, on sales of 85.4 mln dlrs.
    The company said an aggressive program of investment
spending to maintain or increase market shares its its two core
businesses will accelerate sales growth this year but hold back
increases in operating income in the near future.
    CooperVision said "Furthermore, until the entire net cash
proceeds from the recent sales of several of our businesses are
employed to reduce indebtedness, make strategic acquisitions
and/or are otherwise employed in relation to a possible
recapitalization of the company, recovery of net income will be
held back by the loss, particularly of the tax income, of the
(ophthalmic) pharmaceutical business sold to Johnson and
Johnson."

<DATELINE>    ORLANDO, Fla., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc
said it has told Harper and Row Publishers Inc representatives
that it intends to withdraw its proposal to acquire Harper and
Row for 50 dlrs per share in cash if the parties have not made
satisfactory progress in discussions by the close of business
on March 30.
    Harcourt Brace said, "We do not wish to put undue pressure
on Harper and Row, but we also, in fairness to our own
shareholders, cannot allow an offer of such magnitude to lie on
the table too long."
    Harcourt said three of its senior officers and its
investment bankers met yesterday with investment bankers for
Harper and Row to discuss the Harcourt Brace offer.
    Harcourt Brace said it will only pursue the acquisition if
a mutually-satisfactory merger agreement can be negotiated.
    Last week, a group formed by Theodore Cross offered to
acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share.  The group held
about six pct of Harper and Row.
    In addition, New World Pictures Ltd &lt;NWP>, holder of 4.5
pct of Harper and Row, had offered to discuss a merger with
Harper and Row.

<TITLE>DAVY CORP UNIT WINS INDIA SMELTER CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Davy McKee Ltd, a subsidiary of U.K.
Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc, has been
awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a
zinc and lead smelter in India, a spokesman for the company
said.
    The contract is being funded by Britain's Overseas
Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73.65
mln stg to India's state-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd.
    The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead
mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan, North West
India, the agency said.
    The agency said the project was expected to account for 44
pct of India's total production of zinc.
    A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply
of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of
package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development.
    The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's
coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German commercial banks are
cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
usual interim period.
    A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>
and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
banks.
    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
economist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said.
    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
supply aggregate.
    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
expanded target range of three to six pct.
    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
beginning to decline.

    The company said the major causes for the reduction were an
unfavorable LIFO adjustment and softer than projected sales in
the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable weather.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP HOLDS 9.8 PCT STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>(General Partners), a Texas general
partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and
AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, said it currently holds 2,180,608
common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's &lt;GY>
outstanding common stock.
    General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
    Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
outstanding.
    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
meet as soon as possible.
    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and
a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
    A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
whether it would issue a statement later today.
    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
tires and related products segment.
    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
over license renewals at several of its television stations.
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
    General Partners officials were not immediately available.
    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
credit line from Wells Fargo.
    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
the partnership said.
    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in
the tender offer, it said.
    In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it
could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.
    Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered
to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but
withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler
eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.

from the same period in 1986, while the net capital inflow rose
to five billion baht from 3.1 billion.

said he and other critics of Nicaragua rebel military aid will
lose this afternoon an attempt to block 40 mln dlrs in funds to

President Reagan accounts for missing funds previously voted by
Congress and from the secret arms sales to Iran.

<TITLE>MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares
and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
elaborate.
    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
&lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
during the bid.
    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
affair.
    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
information. He currently faces criminal charges.
    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the
most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had
been supportive.
    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."
    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable
touch of the budget."
    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
new chief executive within a few months.
    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
yesterday's 375p.

<TITLE>ENVOY SEES BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR PHILIPPINES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PHILLIP MELCHIOR, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines is poised for several
years of stability and economic growth but faces major
long-term problems from its rapidly increasing population, U.S.
Ambassador Stephen Bosworth told Reuters in an interview.
    "Medium-term out to the 1990s I am increasingly optimistic
about this country," he said. "But if you look beyond that... You
are jumping off the edge into the unknown."
    Bosworth, who retires on April 2 after almost four years as
U.S. Ambassador, forecast a real per capita increase in
disposable income of more than four pct in 1987.
    The Philippines has not seen such an increase this decade.
    He said there were reasons to believe the Philippines could
out-perform the world economy by enough to continue to generate
increases in per capita income in the medium term.
    "There is nothing big and dramatic yet and maybe big and
dramatic won't ever happen. But I think foreign investors are
now no longer saying let's wait and see how the political side
turns out," he said.
    Bosworth said much hope had been placed on the land reform
program promised by President Corazon Aquino, but he warned it
was not a complete cure for the country's ills.
    He said even the redistribution of land to tenant farmers
would not be a substitute for the generation of new employment
in the countryside."There is no way even in 1987 that this
country can provide employment growth in farming. Certainly it
is not going to be able to do so in the future," he added.
    "This has to be off-farm employment," he declared.
    Bosworth said the population problem produced major
uncertainties for the future of the country. He said that more
than 60 pct of today's 50 mln people are said to live below the
poverty line and official predictions suggest the population
will double within the next three decades.
    The ambassador said he believed population statistics to be
understated.
    Bosworth said he expected current high domestic liquidity
to be drawn down during the next six months with some
corresponding upward pressure on interest rates, now at about
nine pct.
    He said his predictions only assumed the Aquino government
did not make any big mistakes. They did not assume any great
transformation of the Philippine system.

<TITLE>SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
action against Allegheny International Inc, the
Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
    Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
    "Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
proceeding against the company," Allegheny said.
    "The company is cooperating in the commission's
investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
of testimony of employes and others," Allegheny said.
    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
for information about company executive compensation and
benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
    It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
divestitures, the company's accounting system "and other
internal controls," Allegheny said.
   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
on its enforcement actions.
    The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
statements.
    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
securities law violations involving numerous current and former
Allegheny officers and directors.
    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
public shareholders at an unfair price.
    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
against all charges.
    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
    In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

<TITLE>VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned
subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
year.
    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
amount from 1985's record levels.
    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
billion this year.
    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
would ensure VW got a share of profits.
    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
to 59,800 last year.
    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
out in 1987.
    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
in 1985.
    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
57,000.
    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
compared with 1985's 392,000.
    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
further new hiring of employees.
    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record
39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.

which it had earlier estimated at 1.3 billion stg.
    The Bank's announcement this morning that it was willing to
lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as
a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates.
    The U.K. Clearing banks swiftly took this up, cutting their
base rates by a half-point to 10 pct. At midday, the central
bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount.

<TITLE>CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jerry Bieszk, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Most of the cattle now being placed on
U.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on
feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle
prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.
    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a
longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements
reported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock
analysts said.
    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in
seven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had
expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a
15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.
    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted
reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively
lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter
cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the
summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally
placed on feed.
    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to
obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge
that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.
    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,
helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from
February, 1986.
    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes
said, "The probabilities are high that in order to place that
many cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to
lighter-weight cattle.
    The only statistics available are from some terminal
markets which represent only a small percentage of the total
cattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs
in February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.
    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,
Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.
    If the average weight is down, and there is no price
weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at
lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as
three pct.
    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly
LBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly
because of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle
prices.
    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain
supplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle
prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from
wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.
    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat
pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.
    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and
Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend
is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his
area benefited from a dry, mild winter.
    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and
some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less
than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.

<TITLE>N.Y. COCOA TRADERS STILL CAUTIOUS ON ICCO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York cocoa traders reacted with
caution to today's developments at the International Cocoa
Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for
negotiations to break down.
    "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short
at this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading
firm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (of
the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.
The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible
gain."
    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted
the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as
a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of
representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.
    "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it
any stronger than that," Ward said.
    "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...
but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," said
another trader of today's developments.
    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations
and have remained so, traders said.
    "The dealers have got historically small positions in
outright terms," one trader said.
    Speculators have gone net long "but only slightly so," he
added.
    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the
last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally
against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure
of origin selling, traders said.

U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986
"wasn't all that bad."
    The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the

earlier.
    At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned Air Canada said it will
make a statement at 1100 EST concerning a published report that
the airline has agreed to acquire Gelco Corp's Canadian unit,
Gelco Express Ltd, an Air Canada spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to comment on the Toronto Globe and
Mail report when queried.
    The sale of Gelco Express, Canada's second largest courier
service, is part of the parent company's strategy to repay 350
mln U.S. dlrs of debt by the end of 1987, the report said,
quoting a Gelco spokesman. The report did not disclose a price
for the sale of Gelco's Canadian unit.

said it expects its audited results for 1986's fourth quarter
to be lower than its previously estimated 10 to 15 cts per
share.
    Philip Crosby Jr, executive vice president, said normal
accounting adjustments, as well as a review of the company's
international operations due to a previously reported alleged
embezzlement, resulted in the lower results.
    Philip Crosby reported fourth quarter 1985 results of 1.3
mln dlrs, or 37 cts a share prior to an August 15 two-for-one
stock split.
    Crosby said, however, he expects the company to report
higher first quarter 1987 revenues than the 1986 first quarter
revenues of 11.8 mln dlrs.
    Crosby said that tuition levels from the management
consulting service company's courses this month are at the
highest level in the company's history.

privatise the state-owned bank Utvegsbanki, the country's

infusion to ease cash flow problems that arose when the bank
lost 600 mln crowns in a shipping firm bankruptcy two years

    Utvegsbanki director Halldor Gudbjarnarson told Reuters the
decision to privatise the bank was a relief and that foreign
banks had already expressed interest in taking a share.
    A quarter of the one billion crown total share capital will
be available to foreign investors, government officials said.

<TITLE>STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Silver looks "unlikely to break out of
gold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although this
year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than
supply, a study by Credit Suisse said.
    The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200
tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to
14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850
tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.
    The study noted that the effects of last year's lower
prices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which
was now back down to around levels of a decade ago.
    However, the study said that primary production, likely to
reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in
1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.
    Around a third of silver production comes from heavily
indebted Mexico and Peru.
    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the
majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

&lt;DBCG.F> will increase its dividend on results in the year
ending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said.
    Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double
the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This
overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of
nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche
Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital
when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.

<TITLE>U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.
Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's
determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but
financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.
    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2
pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed
a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.
    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates
after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg
reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion
stg.
    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key
three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start
of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied
to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.
    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with
gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper
below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.
    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have
placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates
recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling
and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.
    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and
the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors
was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt
prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.
    "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The
Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper
the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."
    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash
to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to
maintain the new rates for about that period of time.
    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how
sterling performs in the near term.
    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially
through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains
would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.
    "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the
time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David
Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold
up rates for long."
    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents
this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the
near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a
whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."
    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had
very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange
rate.
    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of
a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not
materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact
on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.
    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well
as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances
of re-election for the Conservative government and probably
advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.
Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this
was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated
assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial
targets.
    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour
because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's
Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town,
especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry
plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of
recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts
and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.
    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored
rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the
market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea
through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.
    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct
more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.
    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of
current capacity within two years through mergers and
regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month
and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.
    They said from September a semi-government body will assure
repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred
through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another
30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.
    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied
to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage
built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.
    The commission has held several hearings with the industry
and approval should be given this month, the sources said.
    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a
planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support
should help Japanese yards recover their international
competitiveness, they said.
    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of
building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a
maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)
in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.
    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most
yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.
    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for
1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to
3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.
    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to
30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between
1986 and 1989.
    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's
Register of Shipping.
    However, falling orders and declining international
competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in
the industry, the sources said.
    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding
companies reported current deficits in the first half of the
year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report
current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.
    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise
productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also
been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt
years, the sources said.
    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in
fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The
two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --
account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.
    "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out
the recession as their technology is the best in the world,"
said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.
    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,
has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,
and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer
repurchase agreements, economists said.
    They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the
Fed does not have a large reserve adding need. However, some
dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System
repurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a
somewhat increased need to supply reserves.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at
5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading.

<TITLE>BRISTOL-MYERS &lt;BMY> SEEKS AIDS VACCINE TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> said it would
seek Food and Drug Administration permission to test its AIDS
vaccine in humans by the end of March.
    A company spokesman said the company will file an
investigational new drug application by the end of the month,
requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.
    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an
AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to
the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of
smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS
virus.
    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would
allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would
have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing
two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid
virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against
smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.
    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the
AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins
and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity
against AIDS.

<TITLE>SURALCO BAUXITE REFINERY REOPENED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite
refinery at Paranam in Surinam, which closed at the end of
January after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has
now reopened, a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton
said.
    The refinery is run by Suralco, jointly owned by the U.S.
Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton, which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.
    Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running
at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to
full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the Billiton
spokesman added.
    The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when
rebels cut the main power line.
    Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of
bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa's mine
at Moengo in the east of the country.
    Billiton's mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the
capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed
and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the
Billiton spokesman said.

<TITLE>CONT'L ILLINOIS&lt;CIL> SAYS MORATORIUM MAY CUT NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp said if the
Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its
medium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.
    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln
dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10
mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full
year, company officials told a press briefing.
    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,
according to the annual report released at the briefing.
    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a
declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a
moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium
and long term debt obligations.
    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to
Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987
pre-tax and after-tax net by 800,000 dlrs in the first quarter,
and by two mln dlrs for the full year, the bank-holding
company's officers said.

<TITLE>HANDY AND HARMAN SEES SUFFICIENT SILVER SUPPLIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>World stocks of silver are large
enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation
this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed
mine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its
annual review of the silver market.
    The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew
20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply
deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and
production level of 382,000,000 ounces.
    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000
ounces at the end of 1986, it said.
    The review noted that world industrial consumption has been
on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct
below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.
    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used
to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,
with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.
coins, including the American Eagle.
    It also said that in recent years Communist countries have
increased their silver imports and estimated that China and
East Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silver
in the last five years.

<TITLE>SPANISH POWER COMPANY FECSA MAY SUSPEND PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jules Stewart, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's financially troubled power
company &lt;Fuerzas Electricas de Cataluna S.A.> (FECSA) may
suspend payments if it fails to reach agreement with creditors
on renegotiating its 594 billion peseta debt, a company
official said.
    "We would only take this step in the event of a lack of
co-operation on the part of our creditors," FECSA assistant
general manager Jose Zaforteza told Reuters in a telephone
interview. "It is unlikely they will refuse to renegotiate."
    He said creditors would obtain a better deal by negotiating
than under a suspension of payments.
    FECSA is scheduled to begin formal talks with its creditors
on April 6, and foreign banks holding some 184 billion pesetas
of debt said they were angered over what they called a lack of
information on the company's situation.
    The spokesman for one U.S. Bank creditor said in reply to
inquiries "It has been two months since we first detected signs
of serious trouble at FECSA, and we still have no idea of how
the company plans to restructure its finances."
    The spokesman said no foreign bankers had been notified
when FECSA yesterday, in an action unrelated to a possible
total payments suspension, suspended payment on its debt
principal.
    FECSA's Zaforteza said, however, that telexes had been sent
to creditors notifying them of the move, which he said was
unavoidable.
    He said the decision did not affect payment of interest on
loans and debentures. FECSA faces repayment of 60 billion
pesetas in interest and 30 billion on principal this year.
    The U.S. Bank spokesman said foreign banks "were now more in
the dark" than ever.
    FECSA called for renegotiating its debt when the Madrid
stock exchange on February 6 suspended trading in its shares, a
move which officials said was meant to protect shareholders.
    Zaforteza said the company will ask its creditors to switch
old debt to new loans at lower interest rates, postpone
interest payments and possibly convert some debt into shares.
    Foreign bankers said they assumed the government was
involved in the control and management of the electricity
sector.
    They added that lending policy toward the industry could be
affected if the banks lost money in FECSA.
    Foreign banking sources said they considered likely a fresh
postponement of a 10 billion peseta Chase Manhattan Bank
&lt;CMB.N> led syndicated loan to power company &lt;Hidrolectrica de
Cataluna S.A.> (Hidruna).
    The facility was scheduled to be signed in mid-February but
was postponed when the bourse suspended FECSA's shares.
    "We planned to sign this month but that looks unlikely under
the present circumstances," a foreign banker said.

<TITLE>GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance and economy ministers of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks
after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at
boosting economic integration.
    But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
    The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
governors for further discussion.
    He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
    Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to
discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new
system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit
conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.
    The denominator approved by the governors has not been made
public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC
citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state.
They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens
to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.
    He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods
containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with
excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its
decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning
of growing U.S. dependence on oil imports.
    "As part of this study, I think the Administration will
take the fill rate under review," Herrington said at a House
Energy subcommittee hearing.
    The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from
75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988
to save money.
    "My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the
maximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd)," Herrington said.

<TITLE>CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a
substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
annual report says.
    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
restored to current earnings status, it said.
    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in
its entirety" in 1987.
    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
said.
    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
said.
    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
takes place, the report said.
    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
the form of common stock.

administration oppose Canada's ruling on U.S corn imports and a
proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils.
    The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent

    The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if
the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers.
    Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment
which urges the administration to file a complaint with the
GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was
unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85
cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Stern, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the
Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing
the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf
export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.
    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the
cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a
dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than
normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making
it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.
    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA
could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,
where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the
government price support loan program and then marketed.
    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement
would break the Gulf corn basis.
    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county
posted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking the
average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," which
would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior
Midwest.
    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealer
said, which has created uncertainty in the market.
    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort
to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to
the government and remain off the market and in storage.
    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly
more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates
it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date
been exchanged for grain.
    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK
certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the
USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain
by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.
    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in
barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest
to the export terminals, cash dealers said.
    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen
nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the
original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of
the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the
firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.
    The higher transportation costs have served to depress
interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by
the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as
discouraging farmer marketings, they said.
    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"
which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much
as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader
said.
    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,
freight rates will settle back down because of the overall
surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.

<TITLE>GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST BERLIN, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The DIW economic research institute
said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach
the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national
product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in
real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year. 
    The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the
remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and
production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to
1.5 pct.
    Other institutes and economists have recently revised their
forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.
    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that
the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand
healthy but foreign demand weak.
    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for
capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer
goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.
    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been
hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had
caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.
    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were
continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,
it said.
    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute
in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall
markedly this year.
    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change
from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further
improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared
with 1986, it said.

Reuters Latin American coffee producers will meet this weekend
in Managua, Nicaragua. The purpose, they said, is to review the
breakdown of International Coffee Organization quota talks last
month and try to formulate a unified position ahead of possible
future negotiations.
    Two traders, who asked not to be named, said separately
Brazil is expected to attend the meeting along with most or all
of the Central American producers. The Central American
attendees would include Costa Rica and Honduras, who were part
of a minority producer group at the February talks that opposed
Brazil's position, they said.
    Another source, also requesting anonymity, said Colombia
probably will not attend.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House said a proposal for
a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review.
    Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no
position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John
Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil
industry.
    But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental
objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.
    He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did
not agree with existing policy, "We'll take a look at it."
    The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic
Policy Council.
    Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post
to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that
found the United States would be importing half of its oil by
the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael
Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of
domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good
basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.
    The controversial study, which has not yet been released by
the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD
sources in Paris said last month.
    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,
suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing
domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade
negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.
    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do
not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.
    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for
the years 1979 through 1981.
    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a
negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community
would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions
taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters
they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.
    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave
technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.
U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study
including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect
recent changes in farm programs worldwide.
    The officials said the study may be released in May.

<TITLE>FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government announced a three billion
franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation
among political and economic analysts that it is positioning
itself for a period of economic reflation.
    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe
Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc
contingency fund announced on February 25.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a
reflationary program.
    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for
more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third
of French unemployed, government figures show.
    The main measures of the employment program give employers
financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at
least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term
unemployed return to the labour market.
    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security
contributions are the main incentives for employers.
    "Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong
incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour
market and that's why the proposals...Are costly," an aide to
Seguin said.
    The analysts said speculation the government is considering
a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis
Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally
agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.
    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out
economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its
1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.
    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's
remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate
the economy through a boost to consumer spending although
government policy allowed for increased industrial investment
from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.
    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue
from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt
and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.
    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly
reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on
social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.
     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of
strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and
drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with
labour.
     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation
of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas
&lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year
privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it
this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in
1988.
    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted
revenue to boost industrial and research investment and
spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway
network.
   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last
year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage
more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by
improving the competitiveness of French industry.
    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and
variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put
to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed
for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of
State.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> TO REDEEM 15.5 MLN PREFERRED SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph said
that, effective May 1, it will spend 775 mln dlrs to redeem 
15.5 mln shares of the outstanding 16.7 mln shares in two
publicly held preferred stock issues.
    The two issues have a stated value of 50 dlrs per share and
pay 3.64 dlrs and 3.74 dlrs in annual dividends, respectively,
ATT said, adding it will redeem 7.9 mln shares of its 3.64 dlrs
pfd stock and 7.6 mln shares of its 3.74 dlrs pfd stock.
    ATT's corporate vice president and treasurer S. Lawrence
Prendergast said ATT expects to finance the redemption with
cash.
    "The redemption is part of our continuing efforts to reduce
ATT's financial risk," Predergast said. "In 1986 we reduced our
outstanding debt and preferred stock by a total of 1.6 billion
dlrs. As a result our annual fixed charges were reduced by
almost 200 mln dlrs and our ability to service our existing
debt was strengthened."
    The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50
mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debt
and preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrs
since the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.
    ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem
300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optional
redemption of additional shares.
    The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64
dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln shares
of the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrs
per share.
    ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferred
shares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.
    After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will
remain outstanding, ATT said.
    ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lot
according to the issues' terms, adding that the record date for
determining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.
    The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for all
preferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normal
way to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.
    ATT said no transfer of the shares being called for
redemption will be made after March 26, 1987 and the transfer
books will close for those shares on that date.
    American Transtech Inc, the paying agent for the shares, 
will send notices of the redemption on March 30 to the
preferred shareholders who were selected by lot, ATT said.

<TITLE>U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil
depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,
should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at
the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a year."
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.
    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration
policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would
be opposition to tax changes.
    "Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options
would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the
tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been
favored by the administration. I think what we need is to
debate this within the Administration," he said.
    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.
    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's
Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging
an increase in the oil depletion allowance.
    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington
said various proposals were under consideration and would be
debated within the Administration to determine which would have
the most benefits at the least cost.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Wellcome Plc &lt;WELL.L> fell
sharply following a report that Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> would
seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration permission to test its

    Wellcome shares slumped to a quoted low of 453p on the

    Earlier this month a Wellcome spokesman said the company
was applying for licences in the U.S. And several major

treatment of Aids. The U.K. Department of Health and Social
Security has already issued a marketing licence for "Retrovir."

<TITLE>SUDANESE MINISTER PREDICTS DEBT DIFFICULTIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mohamed Elfatih Sidahmed, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KHARTOUM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sudan will find it difficult to meet
scheduled debt repayments over the next five years, Finance
Minister Beshir Omer has told parliament..
    He said Sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs at
the end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.
    Omer said it "will be difficult, if not impossible" for Sudan
to pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interest
payments over the next five years.
    He said Sudan had reached agreement with the Soviet Union
and its East European allies to service half of its debts to
them in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.
    Western diplomatic and official sources in Khartoum say 32
pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is to the Soviet Union, the
Eastern bloc and Arab countries.
    Sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which last year declared it
ineligible for fresh loans.
    The sources said Sudan, hit by a slump in export earnings
and remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debt
liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200
mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June
30.
    Sudan, its Treasury depleted by nearly four years of civil
war in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85
drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds this
fiscal year.
    Diplomatic and official sources said Sudan was now only
servicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banning
them from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.
    They said these included the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the World Bank and its soft loan affiliate, the
International Development Agency.
    Sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984
with Western government creditors of the Paris Club.
    The sources said this pact was to have been followed by
bilateral agreements, but fell through when Khartoum became
unable to service debts in 1985.
    A Bank of Sudan (Central Bank) spokesman said last month
Khartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments with
commercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.
    Sudan has not received fresh loans since 1985 and the
sources said it was only getting grants at present. Hopes that
foreign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr
budget deficit have been dashed, they added.
    Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's
government would shortly announce a four-year economic plan
aimed at starting the country's recovery.
    Details of the plan have not been made public. But the
sources said it would be geared to generate agricultural
exports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans
that Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.

    The bank said M-2, which measures notes and coins in
circulation plus bank and post office deposit accounts, fell to
a provisional 609,457 billion lire in January from a downwards
revised but still provisional 615,307 billion in December 1986.
    The provisional year-on-year rise in January was 10.2 pct,
compared with a downward revised and provisional 9.4 pct in
December.
    M-2A, similar to M-2 but excluding certificates of deposit
and including proceeds from bank repurchase operations, rose a
provisional 2.0 pct, seasonally adjusted, over the three months
to end January 1987.
    The bank said M-2A totalled a provisional 583,806 billion
lire at end January against a downwards revised and still
provisional 593,827 billion in December 1986.
    Year-on-year, M-2A increased by a provisional 8.4 pct in

pct in December.

said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach

    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national

real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year.

<TITLE>MORRISON KNUDSEN &lt;MRN> SEES YEAR NET FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morrison Knudsen Corp said its
earnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986
due to lower than expected growth in engineering and
construction and a previously-predicted decline in earnings of
its National Steel and Shipbuilding unit.
    The company earned 39.4 mln dlrs in 1986, including pretax
gains of 11.5 mln dlrs from pension income and 7,400,000 dlrs
from the settlement of vested pension obligations, down from
41.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
    It said "Lower than expected levels of new work booked in
the last quarter of 1986 and the first two-plus months of this
year have delayed the expected growth in the engineering and
construction area."  The company said it will remain profitable
in 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses. 
It attributed the decline in new work to more stringent bidding
standards and a competitive market.

<TITLE>CHICAGO BOARD TO SUBMIT YEN BOND FUTURES CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Directors of the Chicago Board of
Trade, CBT, decided at their regular board meeting late
yesterday to submit a long-term Japanese Government Bond
futures conrtact to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
CFTC, for approval.
    The CBT's action was made possible by a ruling last week by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, which removed a
key regulartory obstacle to trading futures on foreign debt
securities on U.S. exchanges.
    The CBT originally had approved a yen bond futures contract
in December 1986 but the SEC rule precluded the application.
    The application to the CFTC could be made as soon as early
next week, but the SEC's rule change must first be formalized
by its publication in the federal register, an CBT spokesman
said.
    The exchange said it did not know when the yen bond futures
contract would be approved the the CFTC, but that CFTC
provisions require that new contract submissions be acted upon
within one year after submission.

<TITLE>MONEY BROKER SOUGHT IN VOLKSWAGEN CURRENCY SCANDAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUNSWICK, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The state prosecutor
investigating a suspected currency swindle which may have lost
Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> millions of dollars said he wanted to
question a Frankfurt-based money broker.
    Prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters the broker,
Joachim Schmidt, may be able to shed light on the affair in
which VW says it might have been defrauded of up to 480 mln
marks.
    No charges have been laid in what may turn out to be West
Germany's largest known currency fraud.
    The incident has led to political calls for tighter
controls on the free-wheeling money and currency markets.
    Retemeyer gave no further details of the investigation. His
office understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.
    A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters that
Schmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United States
but had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were not
known.
    Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currency
and money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banks
and other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.
    The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the state
prosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came to
light on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidence
of personal enrichment by VW employees.
    The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW had
incurred losses in the "three-figure millions" because it had not
protected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.
    This was denied at the time by VW executive board chairman
Carl Hahn.
    Financial director Rolf Selowsky resigned last week after
news of the currency fraud, an executive has been fired and
several others are suspended.
    A Frankfurt business lawyer, Egon Geis, said yesterday that
on February 10 he had offered VW information about the currency
fraud and offered to provide a written confession by someone
involved.
    He said VW declined his offer, but the company says the tip
was taken to top management and that Geis later met Hahn but
failed to produce the document.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PLAN SEEKS TO BAR FOREIGN TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House subcommittee voted to give
President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies similar to the takeover of Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB>
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp by Fujitsu Ltd which was
withdrawn.
    The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce
approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a
provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign
companies if the sale was not in the national or economic
interest.                
    The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and
Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall
trade bill which is being written by several House committees.
    The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio
recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips.
This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the
unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products.
    The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S.
engineering and construction firms are given adequate
opportunity to bid on Japan's civil works procurement practices
including the construction of the Kansai airport.
    The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered
by Rep. William Dannemeyer, a California Republican, to require
the U.S. to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their
gold investments in government storage.
    His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins
and gold-backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to
investors to reduce the federal debt.

<TITLE>REAGAN PLEDGES TO INCREASE SPENDING ON ACID RAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, reacting to
Canadian concerns, today announced he will seek 2.5 billion
dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.
    The announcement said the administration will request from
Congress 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to
fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions --
blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern
Canada.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration had asked for 350 mln dlrs but that Ottawa had
registered concern about the level of funding.
    He said the announcement was "obviously related" to an
April-5-6 summit meeting in Ottawa between Reagan and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Reagan said that in addition to committing government money
industry would be encouraged to invest a greatwer or equal
amount to promote new technologies to cut air pollution.
    The announcement said an advisory panel, including state
governmments and the canadian government, would advise on
funding and selection of polllution control projects.
    Further, a presidential task force on regulatory relief
would examine the effect of federal, state and local
regulations on deployment of new emission control technologies.

begin legal moves within the next month against three major
airlines - Deutsche Lufthansa AG &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia Linee Aeree
Italiane Spa &lt;AZPI.MI> and &lt;Olympic Airways> - accusing them of
unfair fare-fixing and route sharing practices.
    The Commission also announced a move designed to put
pressure on EC ministers to agree by the end of June a new,
more liberal, airline regime, which could bring lower fares and
a greater choice of carriers for passengers.
    The Commission has for years been pushing to force EC
airlines to abandon arrangements under which they agree not to
compete against each other on price and share flights on routes
between major cities on a 50-50 basis.
    Last July, it wrote to 10 major airlines saying their
practices breach EC competition rules and demanding
undertakings that they would be revised or abolished.
    The Commission said in a statement today seven airlines
have responded positively to these letters and negotiations are
taking place on how their practices might be modified.

<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia has cleared its arrears to the
IMF for 1985 with a 145 mln dlr bridging loan from Standard
Chartered Bank, central bank president Leonard Chivuno said.
    The government had obtained a further loan of 45 mln dlr
from the Bank of Credit and Commerce to help pay off its
remaining 165 mln SDR arrears for 1986 and is currently
negotiating loans from two other banks to complete payment, he
told a press conference .
    To restrict liquidity all commercial banks will have to
make a supplementary deposit with the Bank of Zambia,
equivalent to 10 pct of their demand deposits, Chivanu added.
    Following the IMF talks, the fixed exchange rate will be
adjusted against a basket of five major currencies, but it will
not fall below 12.50 kwacha per dollar, Chivuno said.
    He was speaking after three weeks' discussions with the IMF
centred on the revision of the exchange system.
    Diplomatic sources said the talks had gone well and a
Zambian delegation would leave for Washington in about three
weeks to complete negotiations with the IMF and World Bank on a
revised economic adjustment programme.
    One western diplomat said the two institutions had promised
"big support to help Zambia keep its head above water."

<TITLE>ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling
last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas
bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next
winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts
said.
    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that
is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could
more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by
1990, some analysts said.
    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities
and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of
activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of
the nation's largest gas reserves are located.
    "We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent," said
James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Many
companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling
because they're betting that the gas market will be back in
balance in a year or two."
    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news
for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely
survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a
barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a
return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig
count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield
roustabouts commanded premium wages.
    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a
barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs
active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.
    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but
dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil
prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.
    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said "In 1986, the United
States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that
replacement rate won't be any better this year."
    He added, "We don't have the options we do with oil.
Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and
importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible
in the next 10 years because of the cost."
    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves
were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16
trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.
    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co
agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a
new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.
    "We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to
dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990
supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later
than mid-1988," Gaspar said.
    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that
could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count
to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.
    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be
conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where
federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the
government unless drilling begins in the next two or three
years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon
Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have
already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later
this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.
    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will
spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest
production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of
gas per day.
    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and
Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in
recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is
on the verge of a recovery.
    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below
600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.
    "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets
above 30 dlrs a barrel," said Pickens, 58, adding he did not
expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.
    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,
is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.
    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect
significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s
when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about
seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50
dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three
dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.

<TITLE>SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin American sugar producers
are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving
to boost production, official and trade sources said.
    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.
Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the
region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.
    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the
alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),
told Reuters.
    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven
cents to stimulate notable increases in output.
    "Producers are taking measures for increasing their
production when the prices are profitable," he said.
    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued
rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders
in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.
    "The prices are ridiculous," said Julian Mateo, vice
president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural
League. "At current prices nobody is going to consider
increasing production."
    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing
output, given the instability of world markets.
    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar
Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.
"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet
giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify
anything."
    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are
available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln
tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A
year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000
more, according to the London-based International Sugar
Organization.
    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar
industry in many countries in the region into a recession from
which it will be hard to recover.
    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's
National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost
production even if prices recovered sharply.
    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from
900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport
and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short
term recovery in output, he added.
    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar
exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end
of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is
running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.
    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems
and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,
since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries
under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its
troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in
1985.
    The low world prices of recent years have led many
countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels
where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean
countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which
they receive prices well above free market levels.
    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to
production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to
the free world market.
    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In
both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year
its quota is only 37,000.
    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world
market levels continue at around half of Peru's production
cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.
    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials
stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane
which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo
Latorre, "grows like a weed" throughout the region.
    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240
mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in
excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into
sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.
    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol
Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from
foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.
    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the
past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant
Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in
1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to
next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point
being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of
sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would
cost eight cents to replace.
    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export
sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with
the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of
either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild
depleted reserve stockpiles.
    However, the situation could change dramatically if the
economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.
    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little
hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability
unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.
    "The agricultural policies of the European Community and of
the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm
by closing their markets, by price deterioration in
international commerce and furthermore by the unfair
competition in third countries," Brazil's Trade and Industry
Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA
meeting.
    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for
what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess
output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the
main cause of low prices.
    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which
would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the
region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement
would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised
countries would have to see it as a political rather than a
merely economic pact.
    "They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,
the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the
region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt," GEPLACEA's Latorre
said.

<TITLE>MORGAN BANK PLANS WARRANTS FOR GOLD AT 425 DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
plans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs
an ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.
    Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders
to acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from
April 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.
    The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated
liabilities of the borrower. Payment was due April 16, and a
quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned.
    The warrants, when exercised, would be repaid in current
dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date.
    The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an
ounce to the current gold price.
    A Morgan (Switzerland) official said that on the basis of
the maturity of four years and three months, the pricing
involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24.5 pct before the
warrants were in the money, compared with implicit volatility
of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the
Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and
24 months.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
enough to buy the company, analysts said.
    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
    "The expectation is either there will be someone else or
the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
group.
    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
and political contributions.
    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"
said Baker of the offer.
    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
for any transaction.
    A source close to General Partners, however, said General
Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
transaction to be carried out.
    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners
would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
the stations.
    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
group that challenged the station's license.
    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
related products segment.
    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
share, he said.
    The company, formerly known as General Tire
and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
said.
    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.
    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
They said it would be possible the company might consider a
leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at
a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
surprises me anymore," said Rose.
    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

<TITLE>NORSTAR &lt;NOR>, FLEET &lt;FLT> OUTLINE MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fleet Financial Group said
that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one Fleet stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
fully diluted shares outstanding.
    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
shareholder approval.
    The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the
country.

80-1/8 on rumors the company was about to announce an agreement
to sell 10 pct of its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit to Nippon
bLife Insurance of Japan, traders said.
    Speculation about an impending deal, rumored to be worth
600 mln dlrs, also sent shares of other U.S. brokerages up
sharply. PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> gained 1-5/8 to 37-1/8 and
Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER> rose 1-3/8 to 42-7/8.
    American Express officials declined comment but cited a
statement it released more than two weeks ago in which it said
it was studying matters of strategic importance.
    American Express officials also pointed out the earlier
statement, issued March one, said it is company policy not to
comment on rumors or speculation. The earlier announcement also
said American Express and Shearson were studying options
including expansion of capacity to meet international
competition and broadening access to capital.
    The latest rumors originated in Tokyo, traders said.
    If the rumors are true "it gives them a nice infusion of
capital for an attractive price," said Lawrence Eckenfelder,
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>
Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six
months.
    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is
expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
are under way.
    "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,
for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's
debt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.
    "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just
how long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.
    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium
may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs
and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.
    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,
Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an
inquiry.
    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.
    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.
Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.
    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.
    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and
other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,
during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
1984 restructuring agreement with the government.
    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,
Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.
    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market
rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.
    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank
would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it
bought three small suburban banks.
    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are
prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.
    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who
will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.
    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The
agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984
bailout of the bank.
    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he
agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not
comment on a successor.
    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its
doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
doesn't need external sources of cash.

<TITLE>EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) has
warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
trading partners.
    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
then the United States would be in violation of its
international legal obligations and on a collision course with
its major trading partners."
    Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
enforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, any
administration must take its decision in light of the overall
national interest."
    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction by
trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
imports from the United States."
    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
    "Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
alone on the world trading system," he said.
    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

<TITLE>FAIRCHILD PRESIDENT SEEKING MANAGEMENT BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fairchild Semiconductor Corp
president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management
buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the
future and substantial funding is available for such a
purchase.
    Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>.
    Brooks also told a press conference that if management is
successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.
    "I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur,
and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the
avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,"
Brooks said.
    Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an
exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu
Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.
    Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of
Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government
officials expressed opposition to the transaction.
    Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be
in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.
    He also said the transaction could be financed through a
debt issue or conventional financing from investors.
    Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment
proposals bought to them, but he added, "the investors must be
willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not
just selling off assets."
    Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct
intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.
    "I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington
and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist," Brooks
said.
    He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a
link with Fairchild.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1988 agriculture budget will
have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    "The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water," he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on the
table," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block," Glickman said.

<TITLE>CPC &lt;CPC> SEES 1987 HIGHER EARNINGS PER SHARE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>CPC International Inc said it expects
1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.
    "We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,"
the company said in its 1986 annual report.
    In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
January.
    A share buyback program started last year reduced the
number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
    The food and grocery products company also said it was the
subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
Jersey.
    The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
    The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate
assets.
    CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its
directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of
improper conduct and are defending the suits.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By PETER ELSWORTH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     DALLAS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. oil and gas industry is in
better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony
given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of
the industry hearing today.
     The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas
industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company
executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry
downturn had bottomed out.
     "The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal
more optimistic (than last year)," Commissioner James E. (Jim)
Nugent told Reuters.
     "It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are
seeing the bottom of the economic cycle," he added, "and with
just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move
again."
     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil
prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to
as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to
around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     At the same time, a number of company executives testified
that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment
was still hurting and in need of government help.
     Production costs are considerably higher in the United
States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell
many domestic producers were forced to shut down their
operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs
operating in the United States compared with an average of
nearly 2,000 in 1985.
     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of
Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil
coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing
dependency on imports, particularly from the politically
volatile Middle East.
     "In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower
prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day
(bpd)," said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply
Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil
company.
     At the same time, Simon said "U.S. oil production declined
by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years," and "net
petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd."
     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain
between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to
control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at
1986 levels, leading to "a significant amount of spare
worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd."
     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued
volatility and called for "governmental and regulatory policies
in support of the domestic petroleum industry."
     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal
government through the 1986 tax code changes and "Superfund"
legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall
profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access
to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.
     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the
industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's
domestic operations before imports reach such a level that
national security might be compromised.
     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports
could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that
Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the
free world's total oil consumption by that date.
     Arguing that "oil is a political tool in every nation on
earth," Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called
for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, "before
the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and
our national security is compromised."
     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,
agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that
were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a
"shambles."
     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.
"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is
over," he said.
     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining
and Marketing Co, said he was "enthusiastic about the future,"
adding that he expected "an increase in profitability by
midyear."

<TITLE>CAROLINA POWER &lt;CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RALEIGH, N.C., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carolina Power and Light Co said
its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
1992.
    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
review because of a decision by the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission that would have required
the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
scrubbers.
    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
through the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition of
scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
air quality improvements."
    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking
purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
development of a generating unit.
    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "The
higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."
    A company spokesman said the company has already spent
about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been
made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does
not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
it will make late this year or early next year.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New England Electric System's auditors
have again qualified the utility's annual report because of
uncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary can
recover its investments.
    The qualification was noted in the annual report which New
England Electric released at a security analysts meeting today.
The auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for the
same reason, noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in
early 1986.
    President Samuel Huntington told analysts the utility will
have to take a write-down of about 235 mln dlrs if Federal
regulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses cited
by the accountants to its rate payers.

<TITLE>NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New England Electric System &lt;NES>
expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
material distributed at an analysts meeting.
    It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
    The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
    New England Electric said internally generated funds will
cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
to spend in 1987.
    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
as well.
    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
construction spending projection is based on the expectation
that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
and a strong New England economy.
    Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejected
new coal fired plants" to supply additional power.
    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
with short lead times which can be built in modules.
    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
fluidized bed units.
    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State
Allen Wallis to discuss the Department's current role in farm
trade policy, the association said.
    NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the
organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the
importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the
degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State
Department trade policies to remain profitable.
    "Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have
in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product
to overseas markets," he said.
    Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next
month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG
"wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns
regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."
    The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held
in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country
to meet with their state congressional delegations and members
of the executive branch.
    The purpose is to discuss the current situation for
producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and
regulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said.

<TITLE>WORLD FOOD PRODUCTION OUTSTRIPS POPULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>World food production over the next decade
will exceed population growth, but because of unequal
distribution, many parts of the world will go hungry, the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said.
    In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee
at a meeting later this month, FAO said: "The long term trends
point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.
    "Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled
by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the
poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the
combined problem of low nutritional levels, rapidly rising
populations, inadequate growth in both food production and
incomes...," FAO said.
    FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the
committee, which meets between March 23 and April 1.
    These included improving the international trading
environment for agricutural commodities, reducing food
surpluses in developed countries, conserving natural resources
and speeding up the increase of food production in developing
countries.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day," he said.
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.

GenCorp carries 100 mln dlrs of same-rated subordinated debt.
    Financing terms of the proposed acquisition are unknown,
including AFG's equity contribution to the partnership. S and P
said AFG's appetite for substantial acquisitions is aggressive.
The tender offer would likely heighten financial risk and
increase leverage for GenCorp, S and P said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION &lt;LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Montreal, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth
experienced in the last four years.
    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
president Michael de Groote told analysts.
    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"
in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
specific.
    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
include possible further acquisitions and said that the
addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
through fiscal 1990.
    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
rest came from acquisitions, he said.
    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing
negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
waste business through GSX Corp.
    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
management," de Groote said.
    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in
cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.
    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to
earnings per share for the year. He also said that further
acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely
within the next few months.

<DATELINE>    Mexico city, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>mexico's proven reserves of liquid
hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down
from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the
state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.
    Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose
sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72
billion in both 1981 and 1982.
    In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in
1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985.
Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.
    The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was
crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.
    Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per
day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.
    Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from
25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production,
were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the
offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of
production.

Co said it expects first quarter earnings to be higher than the
4,800,840 dlrs, or 1.25 dlrs per share, it recorded for the
first quarter of last year.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House Banking subcommittee has
approved legislation to limit the interest rates charged by
banks and other credit card issuers.
    The Consumer Affairs and Coinage subcommittee bill would
limit credit card interest rates at eight percentage points
above the yield on one-year Treasury securities.
    If in effect now, the bill would limit credit card rates to
13.8 pct compared to a nation-wide average of 18 pct, the
subcommittee said.
    The bill now goes to the full House Banking committee for
further action.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Problems in the farmbelt and
oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
    The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
billion dlrs.
    The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
    The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
it planned to issue.
    "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
distinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidman
told reporters.
    He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
with regional differences in economic performance.
    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
the pace would continue. 
    On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
number of new problem banks in all regions except the
Southwest, Seidman said.
    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
year ago.
    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
said.
    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
    He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
expected.
    But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
Seidman said.

<DATELINE>    FORT SMITH, Ark., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Arkansas Best Corp said its
1987 first quarter earnings will be significantly lower than
fully diluted earnings of 22-1/2 cts per share in last year's
first quarter.
    The company said pricing competition and lower traffic
levels in the motor carrier industry hurt its first quarter
results.
    However, the company said its furniture and tire operations
are more profitable this year than last year.
    Arkansas Best also said that if the industry sustains the
upcoming 2.9 pct motor carrier rate hike it will offset the
Teamster labor increase scheduled for April 1.
    It said the labor increase then will be 3.2 pct for ABF
Freight System, its largest unit.

give President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of
U.S. companies similar to the takeover of Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. by Fujitsu Ltd which was withdrawn.
    The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved
as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision
giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if
the sale was not in the national or economic interest.
    The subcommittee rejected a proposal requiring the U.S. to
pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold
investments in government storage. His amendment called for the
government to sell gold coins and gold-backed bonds with
maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal
debt.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary
of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut
down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.
Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French
refinery.
    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that
depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability
to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur
Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment
over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity
of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the
spokesman added.
    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that
Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might
decide to close one of its French refineries.

<TITLE>U.S. AGENCY FINDS RAILROAD REVENUES INADEQUATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,
concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroads
had adequate revenues in 1985.
    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely
to look favorably on requests for rate increases by these
railroads made during the current year.
    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to
rate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.
    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by
the government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate
if it finds it to be unreasonable.
    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC
has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry
and shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of
five commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.
    "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns
have fallen well short of their cost of capital, however
defined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted
with the majority.
    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the
highest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and
Ohio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3
pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and
the Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.
    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the
Delaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the
Western Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.

<TITLE>LATIN AMERICA SEEKS NEW APPROACH TO DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     San jose, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 25-nation Latin American Economic
System (SELA) has presented a document calling for a new
strategy to cope with Latin America's crushing debt and
faltering growth.
    SELA presented the document to a week-long conference of
latin american financial and economic experts, meeting to lay
the groundwork for this year's annual meeting of the united
nations conference on trade and development (unctad).
    SELA called for new efforts to break "the vicious circle of
debt, stagnation and productive retrogression the region has
been immersed in since the beginning of the decade."
    The alterantives to existing approaches for dealing with
the region's crushing foreign debt must include greater
concessions from creditors, according to sela.
    Radical concessions such as debt writedowns and schemes to
tie payments to real income must all be considered, the sela
document stresses.
    It notes that other favorable strategies include foreign
investment/debt equity swaps, already successfully experimented
with in some countries.
    Other policies recommended include more realistic exhange
rates and more producive capital investment programs.
    The sela document is expected to be approved by delegates
from all 26 latin american and caribbean nations meeting here
until friday.
    It will be submitted again for approval by developing
nations belonging to the so-called group of 77 scheduled to
meet next month in havana, cuba.
    At the havana meeting delegates from latin america, asia
and africa will attempt to hammer out a common position for
presentation at unctad's annal meeting next july in geneva.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emhart Corp said it plans to increase
worldwide revenues and earnings at an annual compounded growth
rate of 15 pct and about 13 pct, respectively.
    It said these objectives were based on several assumptions,
including a four pct average inflation rate through 1989 and a
two pct to three pct GNP real growth.
    In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35
cts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge,
which realigned the company's assets.
    Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on
three primary markets--industrial products, consumer products,
and information and electronic systems.
    Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62
pct of projected 1987 revenues of 2.3 billion dlrs, while
consumer products should account for about 20 pct of those
revenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian red meat production in
1986 fell more than 20 pct to 1.9 mln tonnes due to drought
which reduced slaughter weight and to herd rebuilding which
started because of high cattle prices, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    In its report on World Production and Trade Developments,
USDA said that in 1987, beef production is expected to reach
2.3 mln tonnes.
    Pork production in 1986 rose 83 pct to 1.1 mln tonnes due
to the sharp rise in beef prices and is expected to remain at
that level this year, USDA said.

<TITLE>HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that,
due to poor market conditions for railway freight car
manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in
Trenton, Nova Scotia.
    Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln
dlrs for the proposed sale.
    It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower
earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel
castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector
and improvements in forestry equipment.
    Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment
was limited with export sales frequently restrained by
customers' financing difficulties.
    Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways
continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at
the lowest level in the past decade.
    However, there was demand for industrial casting due to
increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.
    The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and
tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the
U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.
    The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in
aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of
engine components.
    Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a
strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S.
imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at
yearend, the company said.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP TO SEEK ANTI-GREENMAIL VOTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate of
Gabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at
the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO
Chairman Mario Gabelli.
    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a
premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today
received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8
pct of its stock.
    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp
stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.
    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was
reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive
investors to show holdings of more than five pct.
    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender
offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and
20 dlrs per share too low.
    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.
    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast
properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
    "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to
the meeting and putting up "no greenmail," Gabelli said.
    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
in the offer.
    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG
[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln
schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard
Wagner said.
    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct
rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to
greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
interest rates.
    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend
to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital
from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.
    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour
to maintain the higher dividend in 1987."
    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
that it came close to one mln stg.
    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> TO STUDY GENERAL PARTNER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>GenCorp Inc chairman William
Reynolds said the company's board and its financial and legal
advisors will study the unsolicited tender offer from &lt;General
Partners>.
    "Right now, our advice to all our shareholders is to wait
until the board advises them of its position ... which will
happen on or before March 31," Reynolds said.
    Earlier today, General Partners, controlled by Wagner and
Brown and AFG Industries Inc, said it started a tender offer
for all of Gencorp's shares and stock purchase rights for 100
dlrs a share.
    General Partners said the offer, which is due to expire
April 14, is conditioned on receipt of sufficient financing and
other conditions.
    "We are asking our shareholders to postpone any decision on
whether to accept or reject the offer until the board finishes
its evaluation," Reynolds said in a statement.
    "The Wagner and Brown-AFG offer does not expire until April
14, so shareholders have time to make their decision," he said.

<TITLE>TRIPLE WITCHING ISSUE OVERHANGS FUTURES MEETING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Florida, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of the major U.S.
commodity exchanges and their federal regulators begin a
three-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry's
growth but uncertain about their futures.
    An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected to
attend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures Industry
Association, FIA.
    The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of the
U.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.
    The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stems
largely from a pervasive sense that the potential for major
market disruption stalks the futures, options and equity
industries.
    This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as the
financial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter's
triple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threaten
to rock markets.
    Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and options
and individual stock options expire simultaneously.
    The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by price
volatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments between
stocks and their derivative instruments.
    In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500
stock index futures contract, recently announced plans to move
the contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterly
expiration day from the afternoon.
    The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends to
implement stricter procedures requiring members to submit all
market-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.
    Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contract
expirations, there is a sense more might have to be done to
avert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.
    Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats of
fortified federal regulation and congressional action to strap
market activity.
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Susan
Phillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequate
to cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects new
surveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.
    SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over price
volatility associated with program trading, has resurrected a
proposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulators
control over the setting of futures margins.
    Some contend that because futures margins are low relative
to stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shift
out of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hastening
a downward price spiral.
    Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressional
player -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee
responsible for overseeing the SEC.
    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and
explore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market
disruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual
trading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for
their own account before placing customers' orders.
    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the
perception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the
practice. The CME board responded with a plan that would
restrict, but not ban, the activity.
    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from
Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and
Singapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC
proposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign
futures and options on U.S. exchanges.
    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the
grounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.
    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the
exchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement
strict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to
revise federal limits on speculative positions and the
definition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new
instruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.

dlrs 40 mln in military aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels,
virtually assuring the aid will go through.
    The 52-to-48 vote was a victory for President Reagan, who
made the contra program the centerpiece of his Central American
policy.
    The vote virtually guaranteed that 40 mln dlrs -- the final
installment of a 100 mln-dlr aid package approved by Congress
last year -- would reach the rebels fighting the leftist
Managua government.

<TITLE>CANADA WELCOMES LATEST REAGAN ACID RAIN PLEDGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government welcomed
President Reagan's announcement that he would seek 2.5 billion
dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.
    "This action on the part of the U.S. administration serves
well our ultimate objective of a bilateral accord providing for
a common resolution of this serious environment problem," Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said in a statement.
    Environment Minister Tom McMillan said the Reagan
announcement was a major step toward elimination of acid rain
and that Canada was pleased with the U.S. decision.
    The Reagan announcement earlier today said the
administration would ask Congress to approve 500 mln dlrs in
each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects
to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that
has killed fish and trees in eastern Canada and the
northeastern United States.
    Canada has been pressing the Reagan administration to live
up to a commitment made last year for 5 billion dlrs in
spending by the U.S. government and industry to cut toxic
emissions that cause acid rain.
    The acid rain issue has been the major irritant in
Canada-U.S. relations for several years, with Ottawa accusing
Washington of failing to act on the issue.

<TITLE>AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr
acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has
dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
officials and analysts said.
    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
largest overnight courier business just two months after
another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the
acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>.
    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
foreign owned courier operations.
    "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
Tony Hine commented.
    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
    "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
under siege or taking someone else over," he said.
    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
debt by year-end, the company said.
    While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
a year.
    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>,
acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
consider acquiring the whole company.
    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a
market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
Esther Szynkarsky said.
    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
business.
    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
door-to-door courier operation.
    "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
it," Szynkarsky said.
    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
    "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
incremental revenue," Hine said.
    "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
through, the more money you make," he added.

<TITLE>COPPER INDUSTRY ASKS LME FOR STRATEGY STATEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Representatives of the International
Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have
told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its
forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between
industry and the LME.
    In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting
between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new
clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about
latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash
cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which
will retain the prompt date settlement basis.
    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change
(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental
change in the function of the LME and in its service to the
industry, the release said.
    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and
physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages
currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from
non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.
    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should
take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry
delegates said.
    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no
change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on
May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given
in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by
Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.
    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance
of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry
fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of
review and change, the press release said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A shareholder group led by Far
Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is reconsidering
its plan to seek control of Computer Memories Inc and now plans
to sell its entire stake in the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, which includes Sun Equities Corp, said it sold a net
365,375 Computer Memories common shares between March 5 and 17
at prices ranging from 3-3/4 to four dlrs a share, lowering its
stake to 687,000 shares, or 6.2 pct of the total outstanding.
The group said it reconsidered its takeover plans after the
company announced it agreed to a stock swap.
    On March 12, the Chatsworth, Calif., computer disk drive
concern said it agreed in a letter of intent to exchange 80 pct
of its stock, all of which would be newly issued, for the
assets of privately held Hemdale Film Corp, with Hemdale as the
surviving entity.
    "In light of these disclosures, Sun found it necessary to
re-evaluate the feasibility of seeking control of the company
and has sold a portion of its shares and currently intends to
sell the balance thereof from time to time," the group said.
    The group, which disclosed plans on Dec 29 to seek control
of the company, reserved the right to change its mind again.

<TITLE>LAURENTIAN GROUP SEES HIGHER SHARE NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Laurentian Group Corp> said it
expects 1987 earnings per share will show about the same
proportionate increase as in 1986.
    Last year, the company had 25.7 mln dlrs operating profit,
or 76 cts per share, up from 11.1 mln dlrs, or 59 cts per
share, in 1985. Shares outstanding increased to 39 mln from
27.8 mln.
    The American holding company, Laurentian Capital Corp, will
show a substantial improvement this year, chairman Claude
Castonguay said before the annual meeting.
    Laurentian Capital Corp, which recently acquired two small
U.S. life insurance companies, had 1986 profit of 1.1 mln U.S.
dlrs, or eight cts per share, compared to seven mln U.S. dlrs,
or 68 cts per share.
    Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm,
plans to fill out its national financial services distribution
system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity
occurs.
    The company also may expand this year in continental
Europe, in conjunction with La Victoire, a French insurance
company, he said.

<TITLE>PERU SHORT-TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's short-term foreign trade credit
lines, regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial
transactions, have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under
the 20-month government of president Alan Garcia.
    Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters
many of the credits were 90-day.
    Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in
1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments
to 10 pct of export earnings.
    Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on
short-term debt, including trade credit lines and on about 750
mln dlrs in so-called  "working capital" credits.
    Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982, but fell in
1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks.

<TITLE>SHEARSON SELLS NEW CDS FOR JAPANESE BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said it
has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to
provide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the
U.S. money markets.
    The investment banker said its variable money market
certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating
rate CDs, with the rate based on the AA commercial paper
composite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly
institutional investors. The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and
was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.
    The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were
Sanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each with
tranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.
    The investment banking firm said another series of variable
money market CDs is planned for April.
    "The variable money market CDs provide a low cost
dependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks," said
Robert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman
Commercial Paper Inc. "The instrument enables banks to
diversify their funding base in a significant way."
    In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were
set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which
is expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis
points, Shearson said.
    The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be
subject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York
Fed's commercial paper composite rate.
    Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the
commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be
determined by investor demand. It added that other Japanese
banks may participate in future issues.
    "For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not
only to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper
investors at rates which are competitive with traditional
floating rate CDs," said Michael Balaban, a vice president with
Shearson's commercial paper unit.
    He added, "For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractive
because they are domestically issued paper with competitive
rates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks."
    Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money
market funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank
paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.

<TITLE>U.K. TO SELL OFF REMAINING 31.7 PCT STAKE IN BP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Conservative government said
it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in
British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> during the next financial year
which starts on April 1.
    Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the
announcement to Parliament. He said, "The government's policy is
to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when
circumstances permit.
    "As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,
subject to market conditions, the government will sell its
remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year."
    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in
September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln
ordinary shares in the company.
    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers
for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in
being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.
    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares
in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price
then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the
government's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or
May, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority
which is slated for privatisation in either June or July.

said that barring any major disruption in production, it
expects 1987 gold output to top 10 tonnes after dropping to
9.223 tonnes last year from 10.251 in 1985.
    Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine
was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure
during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand.
   The decline in gold production last year was due to a four
pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade.

<TITLE>DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
    "The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"
said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
Congress on energy issues.
    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
proposal would be reviewed.
    Herrington said, "I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day (addition) to U.S. production." U.S. oil output was off to
8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
the year."
    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
Congress said "The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
prices and U.S. government policy."
    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
production but would only work over time.
    "Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
would not raise energy costs." Lichtblau said.
    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said, "The members of our
trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
nation." The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
service companies.
    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
will face a stiff uphill battle.
    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
hurt consumers and some regional interests.
    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
certainly be pressure for some form of action."
     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, "a 50 pct
rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Texas, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texstyrene Corp said it has
suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its 9.5 pct
convertible exchangeable preferred stock.
    The suspension effects the March 15 payment, and it said it
does not expect to pay preferred dividends in the forseeable
future.
    It said the payments were suspended because of certain
covenants contained in its loan agreements. A spokesman said
the company's loss of 2,115,000 dlrs for the first 11 months as
a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans,
leading to the suspension.
    The maker of foam cups, food containers and other products
said it had 733,332 outstanding preferred shares, which had
been privately placed.
    The dividend payments on the shares amounted to 1,045,000
dlrs per year, the spokesman said.

<TITLE>SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asked what the U.S. State
Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,
Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders
that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.
    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may
be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"
Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association
of Wheat Growers.
    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," he
said.
    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,
and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm
program and try to figure out what we should do to make it
better," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.
    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that
would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the
American housewife, he realizes the importance of American
agricultural products being competitively priced.
    Speculation has been in the market for some time that the
United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union
at subsidized prices.
    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it
were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials
have declined to take any official position on the issue.

<TITLE>ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain growers reduced
their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
mid-February.
    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
to official figures, and would be a new record.
    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
    The change in yield estimates is due to very high
temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
northern Buenos Aires province.
    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
according to official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to
22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln
tonnes.

<TITLE>FED APPROVES CHASE MANHATTAN COMMERCIAL DEALING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board has
approved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in
underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase
Commercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank
holding company.
    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was
consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But
it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last
week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might
force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting
activities.
     The Fed said the application was similar to that of
Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was
approved last December.
    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90
billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New
York and operates in the United States and abroad.
    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade
association of the investment banking industry, had opposed
Chase Manhattan's application for more powers.
    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial
paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.
     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place
commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates
and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was
given authority to do.
    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and
purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.
    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking
laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial
paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of
total market share.
    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to
Chase Manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kind
of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional
commercial loan."
    "Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is
customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the Fed
order said.
    Among the benefits for the public will be increased
competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient
service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.

<TITLE>BAKER AND VOLCKER SAY DEBT STRATEGY WILL WORK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker and
Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House
leaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work,
but acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the
worse, Congressional sources and U.S. officials said.
    Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks 
yesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.
    But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy
gave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote
economic growth and reform.
    "They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,"
one participant at the meeting said.
    However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretary
of State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. "And if
things turned sour, they could turn very sour," a source quoted
them as saying.
    They were responding to questions from Wright, a Texas
Democrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his
concern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.
    The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin
American democracy and the danger that demagogues of either
left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.
    Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more
confidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especially
concerned about the political risks, and in particular the 
fatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving
the debt crisis would be a "struggle".
    Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year,
Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the
administration on budget strategy.
    His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that
Congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more
seriously now than in the past.
    More worrisome for administration strategists is the
possibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially
granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.
    "When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, they
knew it wasn't just talk," one source at the meeting said.
    The two economic policymakers listened patiently to
descriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backed
by gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.
    The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country
debt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking
economic reforms.
    The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries
for their views under a bill approved by a House Banking
subcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York House
Democrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce
Morrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.
    The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders
also attended the discussions.
    U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the
administration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday
the concept of debt relief was misguided. "If we write it all
off and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither
on the vine," the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital
inflows that would follow debt relief.
    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new
innovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.
    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on
commercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major
debtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.
    "They sat down together to discuss the implications for
Latin America and feel each other out on the best way out," a
Wright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect
the dialogue to continue.
    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and
an uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,
Dilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.
    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power
over the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister
Joao Sayad is further reason to worry.
    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial
banks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has
been presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,
but did not come up yesterday.
    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,
"is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American
issue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger," said
an aide, who asked not to be named.
    There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by
commercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors
following substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.
    At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultz
is being advised the "Baker plan is going through a rough patch"
while Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt
more flexible approaches to guarantee their continued
participation in the plan.

<DATELINE>    Quito, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>ecuador's union federations called a
general strike for next wednesday to press the governent to
suspend austerity measures adopted recently to grapple with
losses from a recent earthquake.
    The 500,000-strong unitary workers' front (fut) and the
100,000-member general union of workers (ugt) have protested
the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices of up to 80
per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.
    President leon febres cordero imposed the measures after a
march 5 earthquake cost an estimated one billion dollars in
losses. About 1,000 people are dead or missing.
    The leftist-led fut said it was also backing a call by the
maoist popular movement for democracy (mpd) party, to have
congress impeach and oust febres cordero, a conservative, for
having adopted the austerity measures.
    Congress needs to muster two-thirds of the votes in the
71-seat congress to censure and oust the president, whose
four-year presidential term ends in august 1988.
    The congress last january 22 voted 38-29 to approve a
non-binding resolution asking the president to resign for
having allegedly violated laws and provoking his 12-hour
abduction by air force paratroopers on january 16.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand
situation has become more bullish recently because of
developments in the world market and increased consumption.
    Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations
subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved
the wheat outlook.
    He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about
20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also
reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings
have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of
greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.
    "It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption
to be in far better balance than a year ago," Amstutz said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soybeans produced in the United
States face a competitive price problem because of the loan
rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of
Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.
    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations
subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"
because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates
while limiting the soybean reduction.
    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a price
problem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.
    Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, and
said "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization
and Conservation Service) looking at this."
    He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.

<TITLE>FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fleet Financial Group hopes its
proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the
largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
banking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummate
the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"
Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
banking institution in the state.
    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
provisions.
    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
up by the money center giants.
    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
merger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continue
to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
&lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
    Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas
Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>
and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
    "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney of
Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
value was 28.02 dlrs.
    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
    He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" after
having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
innovator in securitization of mortgages.
    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
be combined.
    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
"lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
outstanding.

    The Senate has already approved the speed limit increase as

<TITLE>VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial analysts see little chance
that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley
Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
moment we're still in a trading range."
    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
sluggish state, the analysts said.
    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and
McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's
not going to be news about the economy," he said.
    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
monetary policy.
    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
into the marketplace.
    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.
    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
market, he said.
    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to
the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
likely to move futures.
    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
operation did little to move cash government securities prices
late Wednesday after the close of futures.
    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
trading range)," Lacey said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A key House panel voted to greatly
ease government controls on exports as several House committees
moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws
they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.
    The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the
list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no
longer considered important to U.S. military security.
    Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign
competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S.
companies could not sell abroad.
    The issue has been the subject of administration debate.
The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions
impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current
controls should be retained but better administered.
    Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of
a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies
sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be
woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a
vote by the full House in late April.
    Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling
interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to
expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies.
    Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be
damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.
    "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of
our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a
New Jersey Democrat said.
    The subcommittee also called for the administration to
consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive
government procurement practices.
    The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that
the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were
treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on
lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr
Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they
were not allowed to bid on its construction.
    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the
subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese
product--digital audio recorders.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means
Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.
telecommunications products.
     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.
companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of
counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and
patent laws.

<TITLE>CHILEAN COPPER WORKERS ELECT LEFT-WING LEADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     SANTIAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chilean left-wing leaders were
elected by the copper workers union for the first time since
the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a 1973 coup.
     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement
(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of
Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in
the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.
    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist
party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the
principal positions on the union's directorate.
    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces
around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln
tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter
and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.
    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's
directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian
democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by
independents.
    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after
the christian democrats and independents failed to reach
agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew
from negotiations.
    Union elections were called following the resignation of
former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.
    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union
leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court
actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.
    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national
workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO
following a strike in 1983.
    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the
past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against
the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.
     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union
leader when no longer employed by the company.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> BIDDER PLANS SALE OF AEROSPACE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;General Partners>, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling
divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.
    General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer
today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct
of the total outstanding common stock.
    General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the
takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue
GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio
station licenses.
    It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
&lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
    But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
    General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials."
    "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction," General Partners said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer
for GenCorp.

two-thirds of the debt from its 2.8 billion-dlr acquisition of
G.D. Searle and Co by the end of 1986.
    This lowered the company's debt-to-capitalization ratio
from 45 pct at the end of 1985 to 35 pct, it said.
    The company also said that chemical sales accounted for 52
pct of its sales in 1986, down from 70 pct in 1981. This
underscores its strategy of shifting away from low profit
commodity chemicals in mature markets into higher value
chemical businesses in high growth areas, it said.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN TIN MINERS START HUNGER STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     LA PAZ, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>About 9,000 miners employed by the
state corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for
higher wages, a miners union spokesman said.
     Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union,
told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major
tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would
spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas.
     The government has charged that the strike by the miners
union, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wing
destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German
president Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-day
official tour on Friday.
     But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the
strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for
more government investment in Comibol.
     The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has
streamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation laying
off about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, following
a collapse of the international tin price in 1985.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>European sugar output on the basis of
three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white
value down on last year although yields do vary widely from
year to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.
    European Community sowings are likely to be down compared
with last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might
respond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow
said "it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known."
    The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates
which put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but
Hungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.

three differing yields include

<TITLE>CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)
is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow
in its monthly sugar market review.
    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's
domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export
of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be
taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and
the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.
    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75
mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports
from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to
be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may
not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.

<TITLE>GLOBAL FARM REFORM TOP U.S. PRIORITY - SHULTZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dismantling agricultural subsidies
and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
of American farm leaders.
    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
which he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told the
board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
Growers.
    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
agriculture.
    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultz
particularly criticized European Community policies which he
said encourage domestic production by providing high government
supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
the help of huge subsidies.
    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree to
dismantle these systems together," he said.
    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

<TITLE>U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Departments of Agriculture
and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the
increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels
under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.
    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House
Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two
departments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" on
cargo preference.
    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food
aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually
increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost
of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation
Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said
Transportation has so far contributed no money.
    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected
to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.
    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid
shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to
meet.
    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,
its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.
    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn
English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export
programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.
    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference
have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who
view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GDP RISES 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's seasonally adjusted real
gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter
of 1986 after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter, the
Statistics Bureau said.
    This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of
1985.
    Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1
pct, the Bureau figures show.
    The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the third
quarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct rise
in the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.
    Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourth
quarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pct
fall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.
    Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6
pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, making
annual growth of 6.6 pct.
    Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of
0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumption
expenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.
    Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarter
while exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports
2.9 pct.
    Seasonally-adjusted expenditure on GDP at average 1979/80
prices rose to 36.67 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from
36.26 billion in both the third quarter and the year-earlier
quarter.
    The figures are subject to revision over a long period.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nippon Life Insurance Co> is pursing a
possible link with an American securities house to expand its
overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said.
    But he declined to comment on rumours the company would
take a 10 pct stake in &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers>, an
investment banking unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
    He said the firm started to sound out several U.S.
Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago
and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say
if it had set its sights on one firm.
    Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, also plans to
set up a wholly owned investment unit, &lt;Nissei International
America>, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada,
Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said.
    These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put
more emphasis on overseas investment management as
opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets
are growing.
    The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth
of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm
foothold there, the spokesman added.

<TITLE>FORMER N.Z. PREMIER CALLS FOR CHEAPER CURRENCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
    Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate
should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.
    "A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be
between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps
around about 48 cents," he said.
    The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and
floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.
    Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and
party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by
September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.
    He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"
interest rates for government stock.
    "I know of no other country which is implementing such a
free floating policy," he added. "There is widespread agreement
internationally that we have no alternative to floating
currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more
effective methods of managing them so as to limit the
volatility which has caused so much concern and damage."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN PROPERTY MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Thatcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Property looks set to continue to
provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia
and Australia this year.
    A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economists
around the region shows better returns are often more likely to
come from buying and selling real estate than from rental
income.
    In central Tokyo, property analysts project commercial land
prices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's
53.8 pct jump.
    The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is
Tokyo, where the top price paid for a central commercial
property last year was 169,000 dlrs a square meter. A building
in land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.
    But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply
increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach
of foreign investors.
    Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spending
record sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, but
in particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment could
double this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.
    The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will
rise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in
construction will limit increases in some areas.
    Property sales have become increasingly popular because in
some sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several
cities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.
    "We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see
why the trend should not continue over the next few months,"
said Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong.
But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk
linked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.
    In several other countries, analysts predicted at least
some rise in property values, which in one or two cases, such
as Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.
    Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least
seven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a
result of government assistance, low mortgage rates and a
generally bullish economic outlook.
    Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the
outlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, one
Philippine developer said.
    Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after
five years in the doldrums, according to property developers in
Taipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region's
capitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.
    One leading broker said the property market had become an
attractive investment in Taiwan, noting property development
yields of up to 15 pct.
    Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Construction
has helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s,
though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on
property ownership, as in many parts of Asia.
    In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreign
investment in property, combined with financial deregulation
and a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in the
market, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.
    "What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularly
from Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new deals
being done," said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate)
of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.
    Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct,
and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after
15 pct rises in each of the past two years.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former White House aide Michael
Deaver, a long-time confidant of President Reagan, has been
indicted on charges of lying about his contacts as a Washington
lobbyist with top U.S. Government officials.
    The five-count perjury indictment charged that Deaver lied
in sworn testimony to Congress and before the grand jury
investigating his business affairs.
    Deaver, who resigned as deputy White House chief of staff
in 1985 to open a lobbying firm, faces a maximum penalty of 25
years in prison if convicted. Immediately after the indictment
was announced Reagan issued a statement wishing Deaver well.
    The indictment charged that Deaver lied about his contacts
with White House and cabinet officials on behalf of a wide
range of clients, including foreign governments and large
corporations.
    Charges include that he lied about his contacts when hired
by Canada to help settle a dispute over acid rain with the U.S.
And when employed by Trans World Airlines to help thwart a
takeover bid.
    Deaver issued a statement denying he had committed perjury
and predicting he would be acquitted at trial.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SEES LIMITED CHOICES ON ECONOMY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia cannot spend its way out of
recession and has very limited economic options due to lower
world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was
quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.
    "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as
through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might
create negative effects not only on price increases, but also
on the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen in
the North Sumatran city of Medan.
    Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its
export drive to help narrow its trade deficit.
    Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to
help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,
which are centered in Sumatra.
    "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation
sector in which family units are employed in great number," he
said, according to the agency.
    Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its
export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.
    It has projected its current account deficit will widen to
over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending
March 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Skinner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The strong contribution of exports to
the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of
the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.
    Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after
rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year
earlier.
    Equally significant was the decline in both private and
government spending, they said.
    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth
quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau
figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government
spending by 0.2.
    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account
deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut
imports appeared to be working.
    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep
growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports
would increase and worsen the balance of payments.
    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the
result was positive because growth was export-driven.
    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the
growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.
    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul
Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.
    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a
reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline
in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.
    A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter
underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and
public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's
competitiveness, he said.
    "It is clear that through the continued application of that
strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its
external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth
pattern," he added.

<TITLE>FOREIGN SHARE IN JAPAN BOND SYNDICATE BOOSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry approved the
banking industry's plan to cut its share in the government bond
underwriting syndicate to 73.8 pct from 74 pct from April 1 to
allow six foreign securities firms to participate, a ministry
spokesman said.
    Local and foreign securities housess may now underwrite
26.2 pct of 10-year bonds, up from 26 pct previously.
    Under a separate agreement, Japanese and foreign brokers
will allow the latter, including the six newcomers, to
underwrite five pct of the enlarged share, up from 1.19 pct,
underwriting sources said.
    The six new foreign brokers are &lt;E.F. Hutton and Co Inc>,
&lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc>, Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>,
&lt;Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc>, &lt;Sogen Security Corp>
and &lt;Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd>.
    The syndicate agreed after negotiation in April 1982 that
26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93
securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks. The
ministry later approved the arrangement.
    The Finance Ministry is also considering public tender of
notes of over four-year maturity, adding to the current two,
three and four-year note auction, the ministry official said.
    The ministry has decided to lower the eligibility standard
for foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions
by abolishing a requirement that participants have current
accounts with the bank of Japan, the official said.
    A request by four foreign banks to join the bond
underwriting syndicate is being considered, banking sources
said. The four are local subsidiaries of Continental Illinois
Holding Corp's &lt;CIH.N> Belgian unit &lt;Continental Bank SA/NV>,
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV &lt;AMRO.AS>, &lt;Canadian Commercial
Bank> and &lt;Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises>, they said.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's rate of inflation during
January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
    The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
explaining how the error arose.
    Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
January's revised figures, it added.
    Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
in February 1986, the bureau said.
    The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the
bureau added.

<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned &lt;China Steel Corp> said its
steel exports will drop to some 600,000 tonnes in the year
ending June 30, 1987 from more than 810,000 in 1985/86.
    Production by the company, Taiwan's largest steel maker, is
expected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln, a spokesman
told Reuters.
    He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwan
dollar, which has eroded the competitiveness of the company's
products against those from South Korea.
    The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion
project which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mln
tonnes a year from the current level. The project, costing 52.3
billion Taiwan dlrs, will be completed by April 1988, two
months ahead of the targetted date, he said.
    The spokesman said the company exports its products to
Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, the U.S., The Middle East and
Africa.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES' LIQUIDITY RISES, LOAN DEMAND FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Liquidity in the Philippines rose in
December while loan demand and short-term lending rates fell,
the Central Bank said.
    A bank official said M-3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional
149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a month
earlier for a year-on-year gain of 12.72 pct.
    She said short-term bank lending rates fell to an
annualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct a
month earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985.
    Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial
bank reserves, the official said.
    The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19
billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required
were 21.59 billion.
    She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a
deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64
billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in
the last quarter of 1986.
    Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities,
was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. This
was 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and
41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.
    The bank official noted M-3, which includes M-1 money
supply, plus savings, time deposits and deposit substitutes.
Was 132.88 billion pesos at the end of December 1985.
    M-1 money supply rose a provisional 17.3 pct to 42.86
billion pesos at the end of December 1986 from 36.52 billion a
month earlier. The year-on-year rise was 19.64 pct, up from
35.83 billion at the end of December 1985.
    The bank official said the broader M-2 measure, which
measures notes and coins in circulation plus savings and time
deposits, rose a provisional 9.7 pct to 140.88 billion pesos at
the end of December from 128.41 billion a month earlier. It
rose 13.35 pct from 124.27 billion at the end of December 1985.
    She said deposits with the commercial banking system rose
to just over 118 billion pesos at the end of December from
107.89 billion at the end of 1985 and 92.83 billion at the end
of 1984.

<TITLE>S. KOREA PLANS TO HELP AILING CONSTRUCTION FIRMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea is considering providing
special loans and tax benefits to ailing construction firms on
condition they stop competing with each other for overseas
contracts, government officials said.
    They told Reuters, in order to benefit under the plan
companies would be obliged to give up their licences to bid for
foreign projects.
    Sources at the construction ministry said the ministry
plans to slash the number of building firms operating overseas
to between 20 and 25, from the current 41.
    The construction ministry sources said the construction
industry had begun to adapt to drastically reduced orders from
the Middle East.
    They said the government wanted to prevent further hardship
by reducing competion between South Korean firms. Already this
year 15 firms had relinquished their licences.
    Other government officials said new foreign construction
orders fell to 2.3 billion dlrs last year, from 4.6 billion in
1985. About 30,000 building workers were laid off in 1986, one
third of the total force.
    No further details of the proposed plan were available.

six orders for the new MD-11 long-haul jet of McDonnell Douglas
Corp &lt;MD> and had taken options for a further 12 planes.
    The order, which involved rejecting the A-340 plane being
built by the European Airbus consortium, is to replace the
airline's fleet of DC-10 aircraft in the early 1990s.
    Swissair said in December it was giving the MD-11 "primary"
consideration, and had reserved six places for delivery,
pending a final order.

    Taiwan's exports to China through Hong Kong fell to 6.33
billion dlrs last year from 7.69 billion in 1985, while China's
exports rose to 1.12 billion dlrs from 904 mln dlrs.
    Economists in Hong Kong told Reuters that China's controls
on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese
consumer goods, such as electric fans and television sets.
    Herbal medicine and textiles were among China's chief
exports to Taiwan.
    Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect
trade is routed mainly through Hong Kong.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA'S LUCKY-GOLDSTAR TO MAKE CANON CAMERAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Goldstar Precision Co Ltd>, part of
South Korea's &lt;Lucky-Goldstar Group>, agreed with Japan's Canon
Inc &lt;CANN.T> to make cameras using Canon technology, a Goldstar
spokesman told reporters.
    He told reporters Goldstar will invest 25 billion won over
the next five years and would pay Canon three pct of total
sales, which are targetted at eight billion won this year, 25
to 30 billion next year and 76 billion in 1991, as royalties.
    Most of Goldstar's output, due to start in July, will be
sold in South Korea, he said.
    However, the Goldstar spokesman said, Canon has agreed in
principle to buy an unspecified number of cameras for resale in
Japan under its own name, he said, without providing further
details.
    In Tokyo, a Canon spokesman said that under the agreement
Canon would sell facilities, components and technology worth
1.5 billion yen to Goldstar in calendar 1987 and 3.5 billion in
1988, he said.
    He said Goldstar plans to make 35-mm single-lens reflex
cameras and 35-mm compact cameras at an annual rate of 70,000
in 1987 and 200,000 in 1988.
    The camera market in South Korea is expected to expand
rapidly ahead of the 1988 Olympic Games scheduled to be held
there, the Canon spokesman said.
    South Korean camera demand rose to 700,000 in 1986 from
640,000 in 1985. Cameras made with foreign assistance accounted
for 65 pct of cameras sold in South Korea, he said.
    Minolta Camera Co Ltd &lt;MNLT.T>, &lt;Asahi Optical Co Ltd> and
Nippon Kogaku KK &lt;GAKU.T> already assemble 35-mm cameras with
South Korean partners.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has
imposed a penalty tax on &lt;Fuji Bank Ltd> for alleged improper
use of tax-free reserves, a bank spokeswoman told Reuters.
    She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but
another bank official said it has not paid the penalty.
    The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use
of the tax-free reserves is legal.
    Financial institutions can set aside 0.003 pct of their
risky loans as tax-free reserves. Fuji said a difference of
understanding exists between the bank and the tax bureau
regarding the use of tax-free reserves. It did not elaborate.
    Fuji Bank reported a 72.1 billion yen net profit in the
1985/86 year. Lending totaled 16,120 billion yen.

<TITLE>KOREA EUROPE FUND SEEN LIKELY TO BE SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lee Su-wan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 30 mln dlr closed-end Korea Europe
Fund to be listed in London early next month will likely prove
as successful as the New York-based 100 mln dlr Korea Fund,
according to most securities analysts polled by Reuters here.
    The paid-in capital of the Korea Fund was 60 mln dlrs when
it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September 1984
and increased to 100 mln dlrs in June last year.
    The fund's net assets totalled 154 mln dlrs at the end of
last year.
    "Its (Korea Fund) runaway success was mainly due to steep
price gains on the Korea Stock Exchange ...," said Park Sin-bom,
a director of Lucky Securities Co. "The Europe Fund is certain
to benefit from this booming but closed market."
    The South Korean stock market soared last year with the
composite index, a weighted average of 355 listed shares,
rising 68.9 pct. This week the index passed the 360 level for
the first time after starting the New Year on 264.82.
    Dealers have said prices would continue to gain this year
in view of good prospects for the economy and an expected
partial opening of the market to direct foreign investment.
    However, some analysts are concerned about potential risks
such as South Korea's unstable domestic politics and the lack
of market sophistication.
    Despite the doubts, the new fund is attracting offers in
London and shares are trading at a premium of 40 to 60 pct over
their 10 dlr issue price, said officials of Ssangyong
Investment Company, one co-lead managers.
    The offer is co-lead managed by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd
of Britain and underwritten by 44 international banks and
institutional investors, including eight South Korean
securities firms.
    A foreign securities analyst told Reuters the South Korean
securities firms underwiting the issue were "greedily asking for
high premiums" in reponse to big demand.
    The portfolio will be managed on the London Stock Exchange
by Korea Schroder Fund Management Ltd, a joint venture between
&lt;Schroders Plc> of Britain and four South Korean securities
houses.
    At the moment, foreigners can only invest in the local
market indirectly through five locally-run trusts worth a total
of 140 mln dlrs, and the Korea Fund in New York.
    But the government is expected to announce guidelines for
direct outside investment on the market by October, when
foreigners holding convertible bonds issued by &lt;Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd> will have the option to trade them for
shares.
    Samsung issued 20 mln dlrs worth of convertible bonds in
December 1985, the first of three South Korean firms so far to
take the step.

shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out
around 30 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, bankers' balances above
target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and
35 mln stg to the system respectively.

<TITLE>NORTH KOREA TO RESURRECT GOLD MINE TO REPAY DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based
North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean
goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two
years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman
for &lt;Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.
    Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase
output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70
billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.
    "We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in
gold deposits," he said.
    The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six
or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles
north of Pyongyang, Li said.
    Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would
increase yields. "Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated
methods and basic equipment."
    The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by
North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.
    Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off
part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.

that the European Airbus airliner is unfairly subsidized at a
special two-day session of the GATT civil aircraft committee
opening today, trade officials said.
    Washington has called for the meeting of the 20-nation

Airbus consortium.
    It has charged that the Airbus consortium is unfairly
subsidized by Britain, France and West Germany, arguing the
subsidies amount to unfair competition to its aircraft

<TITLE>SAUDIS CONCLUDE STUDY ON SUBMARINE PURCHASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Defence and Aviation
Minister was quoted as saying the kingdom had completed studies
on the purchase of submarines, and tenders would be invited to
supply the vessels.
    The daily al-Riyadh reported Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz as
saying: "A thorough study by the Ministry on the submarines has
been completed and it is probable King Fahd will announce the
party with which the kingdom will deal to buy them."
    He gave no further details.
    The London-based magazine Jane's Defence Weekly said last
October the Saudi government had approached six European
countries to supply between six and eight submarines at a cost
of up to 2.9 billion dlrs.
    It said Britain was expected to offer the Upholder
submarine, made by Vickers Plc &lt;VICK.L> and designed mainly for
NATO. France, West Germany, Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands
were also submitting proposals.
    British Defence Secretary George Younger said during a
visit to Saudi Arabia last month that the kingdom was
evaluating all proposals.

<TITLE>EC FARM LOBBIES BACK OILS AND FATS "TAX" PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) farmers'
and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the
EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation
mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.
    In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,
current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the
mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise
oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.
    This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil
prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.
    If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers
should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and
incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made
available to journalists, said.
    Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially
result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC
produced oils and marine fats.
    The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and
possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose
from present levels.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Higher world oil prices, coupled with a
new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
    The months ahead will prove critical as the government
attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
sector.
    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
    But the economists said this will be possible only if the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
to curtail output for too long.
    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
stable source of income for its economy.
    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
    "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
effects," a diplomat said.
    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
the longer term.
    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
to take over the lead role in the economy.
    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it
out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
of reserves.
    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
borrowing has been ruled out.
    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
plans late last year.
    "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
economy," he said.
    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
tales of high spending became legendary.
    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
company complaints about late public sector contract payments
could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
more cash being placed on deposit.
    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
development from the public to the private sector, one of the
biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

<TITLE>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rebate granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represents some concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, EC Commission officials said.
    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)
per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed
to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into
intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos
short of the level producers said was needed, the officials
said.
    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with
producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar
for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade
it to offer higher rebates.
    They said the French and German producers involved are now
unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar
will officially enter intervention stores.
    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open
to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1
and the official payment date when the Commission officially
takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.
    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,
it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would
drive down market prices further.
    They expressed some hope that the operators would not
eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.
    "We think they realise they have gone too far," one official
said.
