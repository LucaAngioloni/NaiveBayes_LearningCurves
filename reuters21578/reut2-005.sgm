    He told Reuters the decision not to put any limit responded
to "new factors" which have emerged from recent International

consumers failed to agree on a re-introduction of export quotas.

<TITLE>USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department has
accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into
the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.
    In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted
bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.
    The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to
90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
    Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be
ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with
permanent vegetative cover.
    Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"
rental payment that was offered by USDA.
    The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity
certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS
program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based
accepted into the reserve.
    The state showing the biggest enrollment in the
conservation program during this signup was Texas with
approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln
acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and
Kansas with 842,000 acres.
    Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with
646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska
with 554,000 acres.
    In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000
acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled.
    Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program
totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up
to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs.

<TITLE>BRAZIL DEBT POSES THORNY ISSUE FOR U.S. BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>CitiCorp &lt;CCI> appears to be digging
in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of
dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall
Street analysts said.
    "I view it as pre-negotiation posturing," said analyst
Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both
Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on
its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first
quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it
lists the loans as non-performing status.
    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, indicating a material change in its financial
situation. "Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats,
we'll make your loans non-performing right now," Berger said.
    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90
days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation
will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.
    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by
talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between
U.S. and European banks.
    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is
unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half
of this year.
    "Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on
all the interest they owe," Cohn said. "The real issue is the
rescheduling of debt terms.
    Another question is whether or not the International
Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.
    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in
late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off
their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.
    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on
non-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said
investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at
present levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in the
group.
    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC) has the greatest exposure to
Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of
earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among
New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co &lt;JPM> and Bankers Trust
Co &lt;BT> which happen to have the least exposure.
    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers
Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have
lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. 
    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more
involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up
a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed
countries.
    "I don't see any reason to change full year earnings
estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He
thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a
situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.
    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became
non-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks
came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was
paid. "What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"
he said.
    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a
worst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that
Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through
some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to
a civilian government.
    "The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative
to their ability to service it," said John Mason of
Interstate Securities. "We've been fiddling around with these
problems for five years and the hour is growing late."
    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut
interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of
these measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of
as much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees
partial write downs of some loans.
    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks 
could be poised for a short term rally.
    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp &lt;FNB> said it is
premature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. "It is our
expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet
its debt," a spokesman said.
    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to
make a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said
much the same thing.
    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3
billion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is
subject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of
interest.

<TITLE>ROCKWELL &lt;ROK> TO REPURCHASE MORE COMMON SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp said its
board has authorized extension of the company's 500 mln dlr
stock repurchase program by an additional 500 mln dlrs.
    Since the beginning of the present repurchase program in
March 1986, Rockwell said, it has bought 10.4 mln shares for
461 mln dlrs. At present prices, it said, the program would
reduce the presently outstanding 140 mln common shares by about
seven pct. Since November 1983, the company has repurchased
18.1 mln shares for 672 mln dlrs, it said.
    Rockwell said the stock will be repurchased through open
market and private transactions.
    Rockwell said the repurchased shares will be available for
potential acquisitions, stock options, employee benefit
programs, conversion of convertible securities and other
purposes.
    The company said, "We continue to view our repurchase
program as an integral part of our long term goal of improving
shareholder values."
    Rockwell said the program "complements our aggressive
program of support for the growth plans of our businesses with
capital investments, product and research development
resources, and acquisitions in support of our core businesses."

<DATELINE>    VAIL, Colo., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Storage Technology Corp said it is
holding dicussions with the Internal Revenue Service that could
end their dispute over the amount of back taxes owed by the
company.
    "We are currently pursuing discussions with the IRS that
could lead to a final solution," Stephen G. Jerritts, president
and chief operating officer said. "Simultaneously, we are
taking all necessary actions to try to expedite the court
appeal process, resolve these issues and allow final court
approval of the plan of reorganization, by our target date of
June 30, 1987," he said.
    Last year, Storage Technology's bankruptcy court ruled that
the company owed about 25 mln dlrs in taxes, an amount much
lower than the IRS is seeking.
    The IRS has appealed the court's decision.
    Jerritts also said his company and &lt;Siemens AG> of West
Germany extended an agreement under which Storage Technology
distributes a laser printer made by Siemens.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Retail sales of new cars by U.S.
automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels
since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp down 9.3
pct while Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp both had gains.
    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since
the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the
world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several
times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various
plants.
    Consumer incentives apparently had some success, analysts
said, as the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved
to 7.5 mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The
eight domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.

<TITLE>GOLDMAN SACHS GIVEN BOGUS EXXON BONDS IN TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Goldman Sachs International Corp
received forged bonds of a unit of Exxon Corp &lt;XON> in a trade,
a spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Co Inc said in a telephone
conversation from New York.
    He said the transaction left Goldman Sachs International
with an exposure of about 2.2 mln dlrs but that it had
insurance to cover the loss.
    The spokesman was responding to an enquiry about an item in
the London "Standard" newspaper, which said Goldman Sachs "is
feared to be the victim of a new multi-million pound City
scandal."
    The newspaper also said, "The firm (Goldman Sachs) is
believed to be the paying agent for some 900 bonds issued in
the name of oil giant Exxon which were deposited at banks in
Brussels and have now been found to be forgeries."
    The spokesman said that the bonds were delivered to the
firm by a man working on behalf of a third party. He said it
wasn't until the bonds were cleared through Euro-clear (a major
clearing house for the eurobond market) that it was discovered
they were forgeries.
    The spokesman also said he believed that the intermediary
had been apprehended by police. However, a spokesman for the
City of London police said he was unaware of such an arrest and
could neither confirm nor deny it.
    Last Friday, Exxon Corp said forgeries of a 20-year zero
coupon euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corp subsidiary
have been discovered in the European market. It also said
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co was the fiscal agent and paying agent
and that Morgan, Euro-clear and Cedel (another major clearing
system) and police in London and Brussels were investigating
the case.

its first offering of Euro-commercial paper in the
international market on Monday, EdF chief financial officer
Daniel Lallier said in a telephone call from Paris.
    The program was announced in late January and dealers
expect the company will be pushing to maintain its ability to
obtain some of the finest terms available in the international
markets.
    Lallier did not say how much would be offered, although he
has noted that EDF would be cautious because it believes the
market is still in its infancy. In January he said EdF may not
issue more than 300 to 500 mln dlrs of paper this year.
    EdF plans to oversee the program itself, with Goldman Sachs
International Corp, Morgan Guaranty Ltd and Salomon Brothers
International Ltd acting as dealers for the general program,
which will be aimed at institutional and retail investors.
    Union Bank of Switzerland will act as dealer for a specific
program, which is aimed at smaller retail investors.

<TITLE>CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable
farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of
10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain
and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.
    Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus
rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin
new crop futures, they said.
    New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a
large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor
yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest
decrease in final production figures, since farmers will
concentrate on high yielding land.
    Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda
accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental
payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
    Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea said negotiations with creditor banks on Argentina's
30 billion dlr private sector foreign debt were difficult.
    "There is considerable divergence with the banks. We must
try to get them to lower the spreads," Machinea told Reuter.
    He said negotiations with the steering committee for the
country's creditor banks in New York would not end next week.
    Machinea leaves for New York tomorrow with Treasury
Secretary Mario Brodersohn to complete Argentina's team at
negotiations with the steering committee for a 2.15 biilion dlr
loan to see the country through 1987.
    Machinea said Argentina had World Bank support. He said he
and Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille had discussed Argentina's
loan request with World Bank Vice-President David Knox, who is
currently in Buenos Aires.
    Argentina is aiming at four pct growth in 1987 and has said
this target is not negotiable. It has indicated that it would
not put payment of interest due on its foreign debt ahead of
its growth target if the loan was not granted.
    The United States and 12 other industrial nations granted
Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge which was received this week.
    Talks on the 2.15 billion dlr lona began in January.

<TITLE>UNION CARBIDE &lt;UK> DEBT UPGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
upgraded 1.2 billion dlrs of debt of Union Carbide Corp and its
affiliate, DCS Capital Corp.
    Raised were the pair's senior debt to BB-plus from
BB-minus. Union Carbide's subordinated debt was upgraded to
BB-minus from B.
    S and P said the action reflected several positive factors
which emerged over the past year, including a better balance of
supply and demand in the chemical industry. Union Carbide has
also benefitted from the turnaround in foreign exchange rates
and lower feedstock costs, the agency noted.
    Standard and Poor's said the company's asset sales, and
subsequent use of the proceeds for debt reduction, exceeded the
corporate plan of a year ago.
    The rating agency also pointed out that Union Carbide's
successful refinancing of more than 2.5 billion dlrs of
long-term debt has resulted in a substantially lower interest
burden.

<TITLE>U.S. EARLY MARCH CAR SALES OFF 2.2 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Retail sales of new cars by U.S.
automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels
since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> down
9.3 pct.
    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both had gains.
    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since
the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the
world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several
times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various
plants.
    Relatively weaker sales by all of the Detroit Big Three
carmakers have compelled the companies to offer a string of
sales incentives including cash rebates and below-market
interest loans in an effort to reignite the market.
    Incentives apparently had some success, analysts said, as
the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved to 7.5
mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The eight
domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.
    GM said its sales of domestic-built cars in the March 1-10
period declined to 97,487 from 104,952 a year ago while truck
sales rose 14.4 pct to 40,131 from 35,081. There were eight
selling days in each period.
    Despite the lower car sales, the giant automaker had a
bright spot as its Chevrolet division, which is launching a
national sales campaign this month for its new Corsica and
Beretta compact cars, was up almost 21 pct when only
domestic-built cars were counted. GM's Buick division was also
up, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac was
off 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.
    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6
pct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said was
partly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.
    Meanwhile, Ford said its car sales rose 5.9 pct to 50,407
compared with 47,592 a year ago while truck sales gained by
12.6 pct to 35,814 from 31,811.
    Number three Chrysler's car sales gained to 0.4 pct to
25,286 from 25,191 while its truck sales gained 15 pct to
15,565 from 13,585. The truck sales were a record for the
period, the company said.
    Among the smaller makers, Honda &lt;HMC> said domestic car
sales rose 16 pct to 4,394 from 3,786 and Volkswagen of America
rose 4.9 pct to 849 from 809.
    American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> fell 57 pct to 760 from 1,780
for cars but rose 18 pct in jeep sales to 4,500 from 3,800.
    Nissan &lt;NSANY> car sales rose 19.1 pct to 2,137 from 1,794
and gained 3.6 pct on trucks to 1,686 from 1,628. Toyota
&lt;TOYOY> said it sold 500 U.S.-built cars compared with none a
year ago.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Expiration dates on upland cotton
certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are
being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.
    The certificates are being extended because of a shortage
of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for
exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz
said.
    Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine
months from the last day of the month of issuance.
    Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all
new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland
cotton program will have an expiration date of either February
29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in
which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.

to C from CCC-minus Michigan General Corp's 110 mln dlrs of
10-3/4 pct senior subordinated debentures due 1998.
    S and P said if Michigan General's exchange offer for the
debentures is not successful, the firm anticipates it will
default on the June 1 interest payment and will have to seek
protection from creditors under the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
    The exchange offer faces numerous obstacles, including the
tender of at least 90 pct of the debentures and additional
financing from lenders, S and P noted.
    The company's implied senior debt rating is CCC-minus.

<TITLE>TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Ways and Means Committee
is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
approved.
     In investigations involving a processed agricultural
product, trade associations of processors or producers would
have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
duties.
     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
non-tariff barriers.
     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
through January 3, 1991.
    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
before Octoer 1, 1991.
    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
processed within three years after import and exported within
five years.
    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
imports.

federal district judge in Wichita, Kan., affirmed a preliminary
1984 ruling that the company's Amerian Salt Co unit polluted
groundwater near a plant in Lyons, Kan.
    The company said it would appeal the ruling, which calls
for actual damages of 3.1 mln dlrs and punitive damages of 10
mln dlrs.
    General Host believes it has strong grounds for a reversal
of the ruling. It reiterated that it is not including a
provision for losses in its financial statements.
    American Salt, part of General Host's AMS Industries Inc
unit, has agreed with the State of Kansas to carry out an
effective clean-up plan, the company said.
    In the current ruling, Federal Judge Cecil Miller affirmed
his August 1984 preliminary ruling.
    The suit was brought in 1977 by a group of local
landowners, a General Host spokesman said.

<TITLE>AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central banks have easily beaten back
the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized
nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.
    In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,
sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But
operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central
banks signalled their displeasure.
    "So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill,
financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.
    "The central banks are sending strong signals that they
won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind
currencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.
    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank
governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.
-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under
which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of
exchange rates around prevailing levels.
    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an
attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable
two-year decline against major world currencies.
    And initially, traders indicated their respect for the
accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.
    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87
marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before
the G-6 accord.
    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy
picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German
economy was regressing.
    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave
traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the
idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.
    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank
actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply
telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading
conditions.
    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around
1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed its
face so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.
    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England
intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.
currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the
G-6 pact.
    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like
the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after
traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant
to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays
on dollar/mark and dollar/yen.
    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving
U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March
17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the
incumbent Conservative party in any general election.
    "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870
dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday
and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been some
heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's
U.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and
British central banks, they acclerated their shift into
Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were
stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.
    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar
today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.
    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,
sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.
    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents
today from a high of 69.02 Thursday.
    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden
upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next
step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a
very tight range against the dollar for several months.
    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.
Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long
sterling/short mark positions established lately.
    "Because of the change in perceptions about the health of
the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations
are ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said.
    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,
lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.
    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who
have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian
financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the
end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most
controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of
the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.
    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through
the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it
intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.
On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.
    "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in
January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches
on and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount.

<TITLE>WEYERHAEUSER &lt;WY> SEES HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TACOMA, Wash., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Weyerhaeuser Co said it should
have significant increases in earnings in 1987 and 1988 should
be another very good year.
    Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or
1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
    Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to
invest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in the
past few years, Weyerhaeuser also said.
    Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, said
the forecast was made by the company's chief financial officer
during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.
    It also said its expects to see opportunities in the
building products area, particularly in composite panels and in
other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
commodity, end-use markets.
    But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
    In addition, the company said rising product prices and
demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world
markets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper grades
where overcapacity remains a problem.
    Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its
manufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significant
productivity increases.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SPAIN LIBERALISES SOME EXCHANGES CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said it approved a
package of measures liberalising some exchange controls and
easing some restrictions on the raising of foreign funds.
    It said in a statement that the circulars were the latest
steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector -- a move
triggered by entry into the European Community (EC) a year ago.
    A Bank of Spain spokesman said in response to an enquiry
from Reuters that the new measures were not yet in force and
added that he could not say when they would take effect.
    The statement said one measure meant that residents in
Spain would now be able to borrow up to the equivalent of 1.5
billion pesetas from abroad, providing that the average length
of the loans was at least one year, that the borrower was not a
Spanish branch of a non-resident lending agent, and that the
loan was denominated in a currency traded in Spain, in
convertible pesetas or in European Currency Units (ECUS).
    All foreign loans not approved under those rules will be
approved automatically if the Bank of Spain does not
specifically reject applications within 15 days of receiving
them.
    The statement said another measure frees most of the
restrictions on how banks can capture foreign funds and lend
them.
    The existing limit on foreign obligations of three times
the value of capital and reserves of a borrower bank is
abolished, although the Bank of Spain will continue to monitor
the banks' obligations.
    Restrictions on the maximum time difference between the
maturity of foreign assets and obligations are also abolished
and regulations governing risk by country are loosened.
    The latest measures follow recent moves to abolish the
maximum interest rates banks can offer for some peseta funds
and the lifting of restrictions on investments abroad by
Spaniards.
    The government has also allowed foreign companies to be
quoted on Spanish stock exchanges and has promised further
reforms of the domestic financial system.

<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, MO., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southwestern Bell Corp said it
opposes the Department of Justice recommendation that regional
holding companies be banned from offering interexchange
services within their regions.
    Southwestern Bell said state regulators should decide
whether regional holding companies are allowed to provide the
service, according to a brief filed in U.S. district court in
Washington outlining the company's position.
    The company contends there is little likelihood competition
would be hampered, according to the brief.
     Southwestern Bell supports the Justice Department's
recommendation to lift bans on information services and
equipment manufacturing, and to allow regional holding
companies to enter non-telecommunications businesses, it said.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Varity Corp, formerly Massey-Ferguson
Ltd, said it expected to report on March 25 a loss for the
fourth quarter and full-year ended January 31.
    A company spokesman said specific figures were unavailable.
    Varity posted a net profit of 3.9 mln U.S. dlrs for the
previous fiscal year ended January 31, 1986 and a 3.3 mln dlr
net profit for the previous fourth quarter. Its net loss for
the nine months ended October 31 totaled 4.7 mln dlrs after a
19.7 mln dlr third quarter loss tied to strikes and plant
shutdowns at its British and French operations.
    Varity also said it would seek shareholder approval at a
special shareholders' meeting on April 9 to authorize a
transfer of values to the contributed surplus account on its
balance sheet from the stated capital account for common
shares.
    The spokesman said the move would help raise company values
required to pay dividends under Canadian law.

<TITLE>BRAZIL WARNS CREDITORS AGAINST RETALIATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank president Francisco
Gros said possible retaliation by Brazil's creditors would not
be an intelligent measure because it would affect both sides.
    "If our creditors considered retaliation, Brazil would lose
its capacity to export, thus would never be able to pay its
debt," Gros said in a news conference.
    Gros said that during their 12-day globe-trotting tour of
several countries, he and Finance Minister Dilson Funaro warned
creditors that Brazil could no longer continue representing the
role of merely an exporter of capital.
    "We made it very clear to our creditors that we must find
other means to pay our debt. We told them we wish to pay but
that first we must make sure that the country grows," Gros said.
    "We pointed out to them that in the last two years Brazil
paid 24 billion dlrs just in interest rates, while only
receiving two billion dlrs in new loans over a similar period."
Gros reiterated that Brazil will not accept interference from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as creditors suggested.
    "The performance of the IMF over the years has not been
convenient to our needs. It is an important institution, but we
do not accept it to monitor our economy," he said.
    "The banks would welcome us going to the IMF. We would
welcome if they pardoned half our debt," Gros said.
    Brazil announced suspension of interest payment of 68
billion dlrs owed to commercial foreign banks on February 20.
No deadline was established for the renewal of the payment.
    "Our major commitment is with the country's growth.
Therefore, we need more money to invest on new projects," Gros
said.  He said that before the announcement of the suspension
of interest payment, Brazil was paying about 500 mln dlrs a
month to its commercial foreign creditors.
    "We can say that at least we are saving some money," he said.
    Gros said Brazil has not submitted specific proposals to
creditors, and instead hopes that proposals would come through
bilateral negotiations.
    The Central Bank president said he will be going next week
to Washington to take part in a meeting of the Inter American
Development Bank .
    In Brasilia, sources linked to the Presidency said Brazil
was preparing a new program of economic readjustment to
strengthen its negotiations on its 109 billion dlr foreign
debt. The sources said the new program could be announced by
the end of the month and calls basically for preservation of
the country's growth.

tighten meat inspection requirements.
    The letter signed by the 16 panel members said the EC plan
to require U.S. meat processing plants to comply with EC
standards would "impose an unnecessary and unfair hardship on
the U.S. meat industry."
    The EC plan is set to go into effect April 30.
    "It would be inconceivable that we would allow the EC
continued access to the U.S. market while they attempt to halt
our meat exports to the EC," the March 9 letter said.

<TITLE>NYSE SEES NO PROBLEM ON RULE 390 INTERPRETATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Stock Exchange sought to
defuse a trans-Atlantic flap over whether member firms can
trade stocks on London's electronic dealing system during New
York trading hours.
    "I don't know what the hub-bub is about," said Richard
Torrenzano, NYSE spokesman. Some member firms had said they
were worried that a strict interpretation of NYSE rule 390
curtail trading when London closes its trading floor next year
and all trading is done via electronic systems.
    "If the British Parliament calls it a stock exchange,
that's good enough for us," Torrenzano said.
    Torrenzano did not see any conflict with rule 390 if
members wanted to trade in London. The rule, in effect since
the mid 1970's, says in part, "During NYSE trading hours a
member, a member organization or affiliated person may trade as
principal or agent in any listed stock on any organized
exchange of which they are a member, in any foreign country at
any time."
    "The rule has not been changed, there is nothing new here,"
he said.

<TITLE>Venezuela's biggest private debtor faces default</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By keith grant, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela's biggest private company, la
electricidad de caracas, will meet with bank creditors in new
york on monday to discuss the danger of a  default on its 622
mln dlr foreign debt, a company spokesman said.
    "we are in an impossible situation. Unless we get
government relief, the company will be bankrupt in three
years," he told reuters.
    La electricidad's problems stem from the government's
december decision to set private debt payments at 7.50 bolivars
per dollar instead of 4.3.
    Company officials estimate that the currency change raised
the debt to 4.67 billion bolivars from 2.67 billion. additional
preferential dollar premiums put the total cost at 7.47
billion, not including interest payments.
    Under the government plan for repaying the 7.8 billion dlr
private debt, the central bank will guarantee debtors their
dollars at 7.5 with a premium of 4.50 per dollar.
    La electricidad president francisco aguerrevere will meet
his bank advisory committee, led by morgan guaranty, to explain
that unless government assistance is forthcoming the company
cannot meet its obligations.
    La electricidad ceased principal payments under a five-year
refinancing plan last year, althouigh interest has been paid,
the officials said. They said exchange contracts, which the
government no longer recognizes, were signed with the central
bank for this refinancing at 4.3 per dollar.
    The company spokesman said the new york meeting will be
held to inform the committee, representing 72 banks, of the
latest developments on efforts to lobby the government.
    "the banks are anxious to know the situation on debt
payments, but we can only tell them we are waiting for a
government response to our proposals," he said.
    La electricidad is seeking permission for a 50 pct rate
increase, which officials say would bring in an extra 1.3
billion bolivars this year.
    The 30 pct tariff increase introduced in january will only
bring in an extra 600 mln bolivars per year against additional
debt costs of 900 mln.
    Without relief, the company will incur losses of 287 mln
bolivars this year, 556 mln in 1988, 733 mln in 1989 and 1.47
billion in 1990. In 1990 the company would be decapitalized 874
mln bolivars.
    As alternatives to the rate increase, the company has also
proposed allowing la electricidad a grace period on payment of
the exchange risk premium to the central bank, a longer period
to pay it, or a soft loan from the government.
    The company spokesman said the government has not responded
to the proposals and there have been no formal meetings since
january.
    "if these solutions are not agreed to, we face the final
resort of either the government buying the debt or the company
being nationalised," he said.

<TITLE>LABATT CLAIMS 41 PCT SHARE OF CANADIAN MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>John Labatt Ltd said its share of the
Canadian beer market is holding at more than 41 pct but the
total market has grown only three pct since last year when
volumes were depressed by labor disruptions in the industry.
    Labatt earlier reported profits in the third quarter ended
January 31 rose 20 pct to 26.2 mln dlrs from 21.8 mln a year
earlier, while nine month earnings were up almost as much to
92.8 mln dlrs from 78 mln dlrs.
    "Through acquisitions as well as growth in the core
businesses, all segments achieved both sales and earnings
improvement over a year ago," it said.
    Labatt purchased Tuscan Dairies, Green Spring Dairy,
EverFresh Juice Co and Pasquale Food Co in the third quarter.
    The company said cool wet weather last summer slowed total
market demand in the past nine months. "Lack of significant
market growth emphasizes the importance of customer service and
new product development," it added.

<TITLE>U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation
Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral
to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown
would be needed to assess the full price impact.
    "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in
corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the
trade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham
Lambert said.
    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into
the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837
acres.
    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of
planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but
some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates
slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions
figures March 31.
    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program
recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage
to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.
    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,
said there was not enough information to completely assess the
conservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly
disappointing," he added.
    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the
enrollment figures.
    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for
both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an
upward adjustment in planting intention figures.
    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates
onto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitely
looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than
expected."
    The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment to
the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus
amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program
payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the
reserve.
    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said
the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had
expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were
considerably higher than the actual figures.
    "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the
long run," she said.
    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some
confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure
between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or
the latest addition.
    "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid
into the program," she said.
    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas
about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation
sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as
61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the
high 60's.
    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight
reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to
around 64 mln acres.
    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed
earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,
despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor
yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to
final production figures.

Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were
transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
    Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Victor
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muskogee, Okla., was
placed into receivership.
    Beaver Creek's two offices will re-open as branches of
Citizens on Monday.
    The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy
Beaver Creek, the FDIC said.
    Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs  to the FDIC and
purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs.
    It was the 43rd bank failure in the nation this year.
    The FHLBB said Victor Federal Savings was insolvent and its
assets were transferred to a newly chartered federal mutual
association with directors named by the FHLBB.
    Victor was a stock association with 564 mln dlrs in assets.
    The new association is to be known as Victor Savings and
Loan Association and its assets continue to be insured by the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, the FHLBB said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commerce Department said that
all Canadian firms had begun to pay an agreed to 15 pct
surcharge on softwood shipped to U.S. markets.
    It made the statement after talks with Canadian officials
about press reports and speculation in Canada that some
exporters were not paying the charge.
    Canada and the United States agreed last December to the 15
pct charge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over alleged
Canadian subsidies to Canada's softwood exporters.
    Commerce officials would not say if they found any Canadian
companies had been evading the charge, but that following the
talks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the
agreement.
    Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We are
gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying
the export charge on lumber."
    He added the agreement was important to the health of the
U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully
carried out.

<TITLE>PDVSA TO SIGN CHAMPLIN REFINERY DEAL MARCH 17</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it
will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.
    The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin
Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp, will create
a new joint venture called Champlin Refining.
    The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of
30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin.
     Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday
the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60
mln in crude and refined oil shipments.
    PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a
group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new
company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said.
    Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a
day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more -
mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's
distribution system in 10 U.S. states.
    The new company will be directed by a six-member board,
with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific.
    According to PDVSA, Venezuelans will occupy such key
positions such as treasurer and vice-president for
manufacturing.
    The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd
of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates. The plant
will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes,
which make up more than half of the country's crude oil
exports.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5
mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments
and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines
Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a
total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export
commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude
and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
would take an estimated five  months.
    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for
refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would
repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
    Both countries are the only Latin American members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
    Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the
earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output
was around 260,000 bpd.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's biggest private sector
company, La Electricidad de Caracas, will meet urgently with
bank creditors in New York on monday to discuss the danger of a
total default on its 622 mln dlr foreign debt, a company
spokesman said.
    "We are in an impossible situation, unless we get
government relief the company will be bankrupt in three years,"
he told reuters.
    La Electricidad's problems stem from the government's
decision in december to set private debt payments at 7.50
bolivars per dlr instead of 4.3, adding 74 pct to the debt in
bolivar terms.
    La Electricidad is seeking permission for a 50 pct increase
in industrial and commercial tariffs, which officials say would
bring in an extra 1.3 billion bolivars this year.
    A 30 pct tariff increase introduced in january will only
bring in an extra 600 mln bolivars per year as against
additional debt costs of 900 mln.

<TITLE>SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia has dropped its
condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees
before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, the state-oil company,
Petrobras, said in a statement.
    Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil
credit guarantees.
    Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr crude oil purchase from
the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of
credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had
demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading
international banks.
    Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did
not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the
purchase of oil with other producers.
    The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln
barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.
    The shipment is part contract signed in February for the
Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until
June.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Telecommunications Inc said
it called for rejection of the recommendation that the regional
Bell telephone companies be allowed to enter the long-distance
business at this time.
    In comments to U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, the
company said modification of other restrictions currently
imposed on the regionals would be acceptable.
    United Telecommunications operates U.S. Sprint, a long
distance telephone service, in a joint venture with GTE Corp
&lt;GTE>.
    Separately, US Sprint in its comments told Judge Green that
allowing the Bell operating companies into the long-distance
business could undo all the strides toward full competition
since the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> in
1984.
    The U.S. Justice Department has proposed lifting
restrictions on the regional phone companies so they can enter
the long-distance business in areas where they do not provide
local service.

<TITLE>TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. economic data due out next week is
unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
    "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
doing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
Mains.
    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
volume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recent
economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said.
    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
markets after the Paris initiative has made for "less than
ebullient market action," Mains said.
    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
top of the trading range.
    "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified," Mains said.
    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening,"
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
were "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
Leiner.
    "There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
at this moment," Leiner said.
    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
direction of bond prices over the next month.
    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
the largest increase since 1979.
    "The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
sustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said.
    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
second quarter growth.
    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citibank, the main susbidiary of
Citicorp, said the filing it made with the Securities and
Exchange Commission about the possible impact on earnings
should certain Brazilian loans be placed on a cash basis was
not linked to debt talks that are about to begin with Brazil.
    Citibank said it had told the SEC that its earnings could
be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after-tax in the first quarter, and
190 mln dlrs in the year, if it has to declare 3.9 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term Brazilian loans non-performing.    
    Rather, Citibank said it was simply complying with the
disclosure requirements contained in the U.S. Securities Acts.
    Citibank said in its filing with the SEC that it was
premature to decide now whether the loans should be placed on a
non-perfoming basis, a view that was echoed by spokesmen of
several other major U.S. banks.

    The nuclear reactor -- one of two at the site south of

<TITLE>MEXICO TEMPORARILY HALTS DEBT-EQUITY SWAPS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mexico has temporarily suspended its
debt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as an
attempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks to
participate in a new 7.7 billion dlr loan for the country.
    The scheme, which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesos
to finance investment in Mexico, is likely to resume soon after
the loan package is signed on March 20.
    But the move is a further indication of the strains that
have developed between Mexico and the banks because of the
difficulty of syndicating the huge loan, bankers said.
    Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program on
February 25.
    Adolfo Hegewisch, Mexico's Undersecretary for Commerce,
confirmed that the swap program had been halted, but he told a
Euromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had been
forced to act because it had been inundated with applications.
    Between January 1 and February 15, 132 firms had applied to
do a debt-equity conversion, compared with 100 between May and
December 1986. "We were not accustomed to receive so much
work," said Hegewisch, who is responsible for foreign
investment in Mexico.
    Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs had
piled up at the finance ministry, which has said it wants to
limit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month.
    But some bankers, who declined to be identified, said the
halt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on the
banks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditors
worldwide to participate in the loan.
    Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed, but dozens of
smaller banks are still baulking. Assistant U.S. Treasury
Secretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance of
these banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage.
    "The Mexicans basically said, We're not going to subsidize
foreigners until we have a deal," one banker said.
    Other bankers, however, said Mexico's motives were not so
sinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absence
of top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks.
    "They want to focus on the deal, and they wanted the banks
to focus on the deal," one source said.
    Apart from the present disruption, bankers and company
officials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a huge
success.    
    Frank Fountain, Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp, said
a 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothly
that Chrysler has plans for more.
    Chrysler, working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co,
bought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mln
dlrs, mainly from European banks. The cost was about 65 mln
dlrs in cash and paper.
    It then presented the paper to Mexico's central bank and
received the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which it
invested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export to
North America.
    Susan Segal, senior vice president of Manufacturers
Hanover, said the swaps not only reduce Mexico's debt burden
but help to recapitalize local industries that may have been
squeezed out of the local capital markets.
    Fountain said that even a large well-established firm such
as Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term peso
financing on reasonable terms in Mexico.
    Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date,
and Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pending
are for investments in the electronic and chemical industries,
with Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest.
    But the interest is spreading. Segal said Manufacturers
Hanover has been authorized to convert part of its own
portfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels.
    She said the sums involved are considerable, but gave no
details. The bank is also looking into joint ventures with
manufacturing and trading companies, Segal added.
    And, as part of the agreement with the banks that will be
signed next week, Mexican residents will be allowed to
participate in the scheme, hitherto reserved for foreign firms,
in the hope that some of the 30 billion dlrs estimated to be
held abroad will be repatriated.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commerce Department said all
Canadian firms have begun to pay an agreed 15 pct surcharge on
softwood shipped to U.S. markets.
    It made the statement after talks with Canadian officials
about rumors in Canada that some exporters were not paying the
charge.
    Canada and the U.S. agreed last December to the 15 pct
charge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over alleged Canadian
subsidies to Canada's softwood exporters.
    Commerce officials declined to say if any Canadian
companies had been evading the charge, but said following the
talks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the
agreement.
    Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We are
gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying
the export charge on lumber."
    He added the agreement was important to the health of the
U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully
carried out.

<TITLE>NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIED-COLOMBIA OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A decision by Colombia to open coffee
export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the
country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld,
Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
association, told Reuters.
    Colombia today opened export registrations for april and
may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no
limit.
    Since the start of the coffee year last october, private
exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per
month.
    "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing
heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will
quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go
over the top," Arango said in an interview.
    "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but
consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react
to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give
its coffee away," he added.
    Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including
a lower export registration price, as a major change in
Colombia's coffee marketing policy.
    The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to
1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70
kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).
    The government announced a more flexible policy of
reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which
arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will
undoubtedly be more actively present in the market.
    A frequent gap between international market prices and the
reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.

    The plan is designed to protect shareholders against
unsolicited or coercive takeover attempts.
    The rights, which would allow holders to buy one-half share
of common for 20 dlrs, will be exercisable if a suitor acquires
25 pct or more of the company's common as of today or 30 pct at
a later date, or if such a holder begins a tender offer to
acquire the company, or in other circumstances.
    Under certain conditions, the rights will allow holders to
buy stock in a surviving company at half price.
    Baird can redeem the rights at five cts apiece subject to
certain conditions, it said.

<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>William Mulholland, president of the
Bank of Montreal, said here it is important for Brazil to seek
its economic growth.
    Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Brazilian
Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, the Canadian banker said he
suggested to Funaro the conversion of Brazil's 1.3 billion
dollars debt with the Bank of Montreal by direct investments in
this country.
    He said the Brazilian minister was impressed with his
initiative and that he (Funaro) had submitted the proposal to
the Central Bank for a broader analysis.
    Commenting on Brazil's decision to suspend payment of
interests to private creditor banks, Mulholland said he would
rather see that it did not happen, but that he understood the
decision made by the Brazilian government:
    "A country like Brazil cannot stop growing. Of course, it
must also seek an internal adjustment capable of controlling
the spiral of its inflation and public deficit," he said.
    He suggested Brazil and the international financial
community to work together and seek stable conditions to face
the problems of this country's foreign debt.

private foreign banks due to last week's earthquake which
caused up to one billion dollars in damage.
    Febres Cordero, quoted in an Information Ministry
communique, said: "We have to ratify this suspension ... on debt
service to the private international banks.
    "I am not ashamed to say it, there definitely isn't a way to
pay," he said.
    Ecuador had already suspended payments to private foreign
banks, holding two-thirds of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dollar
foreign debt, from last January due to a cash-flow squeeze
stemming from a slide in world oil prices last year.
    But finance officials had earlier said the length of the
suspension would depend on negotiations with private foreign
banks.
    The information ministry communique said febres cordero
made these statments to reporters at lago agrio, at the heart
of ecuador's region of jungle oilfields, before returning to
quito.
    Febres cordero said up to a total of 1,000 people died or
were missing in avalanches and mudslides during the march 5
earthquake.
    The tremor damaged an oil pipeline, thus barring all crude
exports for a projected five months. Oil accounts for up to
two-thrids of ecuador's total exoprts and for as much as 60 per
cent of the government's revenues.
    He did not specify for how long the suspension of payments
would last.
    Ecuador owes private foreign banks 450 to 500 mln dlrs in
interest payments for the rest of the year and 66 mln dlrs
in principal payments maturing in 1987, finance officials said.
    Finance minister domingo cordovez said two days ago the
government seeks to postpone all the payments due to private
foreign banks in 1987 until next year through negotiations with
these creditors.

<TITLE>MAJOR DIFFERENCES RESOLVED AT RUBBER PACT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claude Fillet</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiators at a United Nations
conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement
(INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference
chairman Manaspas Xuto said.
    "We have resolved major differences of opinion," he told
Reuters.
    Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,
to replace the current one which expires in October.
    Xuto said: "I welcome the friendly and cooperative
atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption" since the
talks began last Monday.
    "It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to
ratify the new agreement," he added.
    The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the
fourth such meeting in two years.
    Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four
points:
    1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.
    Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals
between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.
    2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over
six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower
intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the
reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or
upwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber
Organisation council decides on a higher percentage.
    If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,
the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct
unless the council decides on a higher percentage.
    3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at
which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is
brought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents
above the floor price -- or 152 cents.
    4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the
talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to
lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.
    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last
night, setting the stage for compromise.
    Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and
formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking
part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20.
    The current conference was widely seen as the last chance
to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new
five- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in
October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the
buffer stock.
    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and
Britain are the major consumers.
    UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in
rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK OFFICIAL CALLS FOR BANKER FLEXIBILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank Vice-President David
Knox said creditor banks must become more flexible in providing
funds for Latin American debtor nations.
    "The international creditor banks must make their position
more flexible, ensuring a flow of funds for Latin American
countries, especially the most indebted," Knox told the semi-
official newsagency Telam.
    Knox said Brazil's decision last month to suspend payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt had shocked the creditor
banks. The banks were "in no hurry to provide funds for the
debtor nations," he said.
    But he said the situation of debtor nations transferring
funds to the developed should be reversed. "It must be the other
way round, to make development in indebted states possible."
    He said the World Bank was supplying special lines of
credit to make up for this inflexibility on the part of the
banks. It had increased its involvement in development projects
by 60 pct in the last two years, he said.
    Knox said banks would grant Argentina loans of up to two
billion dlrs over the next two years to help the country meet
growth targets. Argentina is currently negotiating a 2.15
billion dlr loan with creditor banks for 1987.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador yesterday said last week's earthquake was forcing
it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in
world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign
banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."
    He said he had previously held that Ecuador was obliged to
make debt payments when crude oil was at 26 dlrs a barrel
because the government had projected plans with crude prices at
that level.
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.

<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said banks must make
provisions amounting to at least 25 pct of outstanding loans to
countries deemed to be high-risk borrowers.
    The measure was included in a package of circulars approved
by governors of the central bank yesterday.
    The bank said it was retaining a complex system for
calculating the proportion of loans which must be covered by
special provisions but added that sudden shifts in the
situation of borrowers had made it advisable to set a minimum
level of 25 pct for such provisions.
    The bank said another measure instructs banks and financial
institutions to begin setting aside provisions for future
pension obligations.
    Banks were obliged last year to ensure that they had made
sufficient provisions for current pension obligations and a new
circular sets a maximum time limit of five years to cover
future obligations.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador announced an austerity program
and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last
week's earthquake which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised
address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct,
government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top
officials, including the president and cabinet, would be
reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol
would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by
20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited.
    Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was
aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of
specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to
the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers.
    The items for which prices were frozen included rice,
sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes,
soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables.
    Ecuador's consumer price inflation was 23 pct in 1986.
    The price of 92-octane petrol rises to 110 sucres a U.S.
Gallon from 65 sucres. Eighty-octane petrol increases to 90
sucres from 50.

one mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990
under a development program adopted by the Yugoslav Iron and
Steel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agency
said.
    The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and
steel enterprises.
    Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of
nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program.
Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching
4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.
    Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for
raising exports of finished steel products.
    The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln
tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than
last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIAN OIL FIRM STARTS WORKING WITH FRENCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gas
producer &lt;Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation
contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern
&lt;Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said.
    Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries
in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the
petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The
Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.
    Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs.
    Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG
&lt;HFAG.F> two years ago.
    Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects,
involving Yugoslavia's other main producer &lt;Naftagas> of Novi
Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring
for and exploiting oil and natural gas.
    An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained
from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said.
    Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil
production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year.
    Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and
services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's
leading export enterprises.
    In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it
has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over
3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly
prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there.
    Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start
soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest
about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area.
    Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the
Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option
rights in the region to Ina, it said.

<TITLE>INDONESIA DENIES GIVING PALM OIL IMPORT LICENCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia, the world's second largest
producer of palm oil, has not issued licences to import the
commodity, a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade said.
    Traders in London said Indonesia has issued licences to
local operators to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil
starting in April, but the spokesman said this was incorrect.
    A spokesman for the Indonesian Importers Association also
denied knowledge of the import plan. He said importers would
quickly know if licences were issued. The Trade Ministry
official said there was no sign of a palm oil shortage in
Indonesia.

<TITLE>IRAN HAS ANTI-SHIP MISSILES NEAR GULF - PAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran has deployed about six large
missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to
shipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.
    The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying the
missiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 which
is based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile.
    Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles.
    It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and
quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a
supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.
    Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the
explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only
with a lucky hit, the paper said. None of the new missiles had
been fired yet, it added.
    The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had
installed new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had
warned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping.

<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslav trade union leaders are
touring the country in an attempt to quell a wave of strikes
following a partial wages freeze, official sources said.
    Eyewitnesses in the northern city of Zagreb reported far
more police on the streets than normal after the city and areas
nearby experienced the biggest wave of strikes in the country
in recent memory.
    National newspapers in Belgrade have given few details of
the strikes. But Zagreb papers said thousands of workers went
on strike and thousands more were threatening action over pay
cuts.
    Official sources said there were also strikes at a Belgrade
medical centre, a food factory in Sambor, and enterprises in
Nis, Leskovac and Kraljevo, as well as other towns.
    They said national union officials were travelling
throughout the country to speak to meetings in an attempt to
restore calm.
    But trade union leaders were avoiding making statements to
the press and had not made their stand on the strikes clear.
    Western diplomats said the strikes appeared to be
spontaneous and without any unified orchestration.

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAMPINAS, Brazil, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian bank workers voted
to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour
unrest arising from the failure of the government's
anti-inflation plan.
    At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao
Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24
unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.
    Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national
confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions
representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite
stoppage would affect all banks.
    The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third
week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the
state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.
    The government ordered thousands of troops into the
refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the
troops were removed yesterday.
    Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because
the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their
willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also
sent marines into the main ports.
    A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de
Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private
shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.
    Seamen employed by two small companies have already
accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about
5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.
    Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of
thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high
interest rates charged by banks.
    According to official estimates, prices rose by more than
33 pct in the first two months of this year.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS HE WRONG IN SELLING ARMS TO IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan for the first time
admitted he was wrong to sell arms to Iran in an initiative
which four months ago plunged him into the worst crisis of his
six-year-old presidency.
    He made the admission in a weekly radio address while
defending the role played by Secretary of State George Shultz
and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the affair.
    He said: "In the case of the Iranian arms sale matter, both
Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger advised me strongly
not to pursue the initiative. I weighed their advice but
decided in the end the initiative was worth the risk and went
forward."
    "As we now know, it turned out they were right and I was
wrong. But they discharged their responsibilities as my
advisers and as my subordinates," he said.
    Since the scandal broke last November, Shultz and
Weinberger have said they told Reagan of their opposition to
the deal and were not fully informed of the effort, carried out
by National Security Council members.
    They also said they were unaware of the diversion of
millions of dollars in profits from the arms sales to the
Nicaraguan contra rebels, who have been fighting the leftist
Managua government for six years.

<TITLE>VW AFFAIR COULD DELAY SHARE SALE - STOLTENBERG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg was quoted as saying a possible currency fraud at
Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> may affect government plans to sell its
20 pct stake in the carmaker this year.
    "It is all very unpleasant for us because we have decided to
privatise the VW shares this year. We will now have to ask
ourselves the question whether we can keep to this date," he
told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview.
    Bild am Sonntag released the text ahead of publication
    Stoltenberg did not elaborate on the share sale. The West
German government owns 20 pct of VW ordinary share capital and
has said previously it plans to sell it either in 1987 or 1988.
    Stoltenberg told Bild am Sonntag the possible fraud showed
there had "clearly been reprehensible criminal conduct below the
level of the responsible management board."
    "I do not want to prejudge results but the immediate and
serious question which poses itself is whether certain
management board members have kept their areas of business
under appropriate control," he was quoted as saying.
    VW said last week it had discovered possibly fraudulent
currency transactions which could cost the company 480 mln
marks and had asked state prosecutors to investigate.
    It said on Friday it had dismissed the head of its foreign
exchange department, Burkhard Junger.
    VW also said it suspended six staff, including financial
transfer department chief Guenther Borchert and the head of the
central cash and currency clearing department, Siegfried
Mueller.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill
this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt
a trade war.
    "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as
I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in
a television interview.
    "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill
out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to
work together with the administration, but there is a hardening
trade attitude," he said.
    President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation, but
agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that
opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.
    However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalise
trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for
failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. Could lead
to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any
such bill.
    When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade
war, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any question
about that."

<TITLE>THATCHER PARTY HAS NINE POINT POLL LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's ruling Conservatives have a
nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their
biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published in
the Sunday Times.
    The MORI poll's findings come as the latest in a series of
setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.
    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against
32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall
majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.
    The poll, which follows a survey by Marplan last week
giving the Conservatives a six-point lead over Labour, shows
how dramatically the fortunes of Britain's two largest parties
have changed over the past six months.
    As recently as September, Labour was still ahead in opinion
polls and was looking forward to forming Britain's next
government. Since then, it has been beset by inner wrangling
and its popularity among Britain's voters has tumbled.
    Morale among Labour politicians slumped further last month
when the party lost a key by-election in Greenwich, south
London -- a seat which Labour had held for 50 years.

<TITLE>PANEL HEAD SAYS MARCOS STILL CONTROLS LARGE FUNDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The head of a Philippine panel charged
with recovering illegal wealth accumulated by former President
Ferdinand Marcos and his associates said they still controlled
large funds circulating in the country's economy.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters in an interview: "There is every
reason to believe that the cronies and President Marcos and his
family were able to hide millions and millions of pesos before
they fled. As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold of
crates of newly printed currency."
    Diaz did not give figures, but said: "We believe they still
have a lot of funds. These are the funds that they will use in
the coming elections. These are the funds that they used to
stage those coups."
    He was referring to congressional elections scheduled for
May 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by President
Corazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.
    Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and property
valued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered shares
of stock of at least 286 firms. "We have achieved more than what
we thought we could achieve in one year," he added.
    The PCGG, set up by Aquino in February 1986, has sweeping
powers of sequestration, seizure and inspection of bank
accounts. Diaz said the panel's main task is to gather evidence
for legal prosecution. "But we have to sequester before we file
a case and that is the legal objection because they say that we
shoot first before we ask questions," he said.
    He said dividends from seized shares were held in trust
funds pending court verdicts, adding several Marcos associates
had made confessions about their wealth. He did not name them.
    "They are very concerned and afraid that if their names
appear something may happen to them," he said.
    The government last week announced that businessman Antonio
Floirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the "banana king," had
turned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised to
surrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worth
another 180 mln pesos. In return, the PCGG said it had lifted
freeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.
    Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreements
with another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. He said
Benedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers and
radio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of the
boards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.
    Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth on
income-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.
"Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we have
to recover," he said.
    He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe street
certificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchanges
was prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were in
circulation.
    Street certificates describe securities held in the name of
a broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as to
permit easy trading or transfer.
    Share prices at the two exchanges reacted nervously last
Tuesday when news of the probe leaked. The composite index at
the Manila Stock Exchange fell 18.61 points to 451.51, while
that at the Makati Stock Exchange slipped 1.7326 points to
close at 63.0618. There was a slight recovery the following
day.
    The presidents of the two exchanges appealed to Diaz to
carry out the probe discreetly so investors were not scared
away, saying street certificates did not necessarily indicate
"anomalous transactions."
    "It's unfortunate that (news of the probe) leaked out to the
papers," Diaz said.
    Diaz said PCGG suspicions were aroused by the stock market
boom over the past year. The Manila Stock Exchange composite
index jumped 224 pct from 131.32 to 424.81 in 1986.
    "One of our functions is to see to it that these assets that
we have sequestered do not go right back into the hands of the
(Marcos) cronies," he said.
    "We want to make sure that these stock exchanges are not
being manipulated by the cronies because maybe they want to
launder their pesos and that is why the prices are just
skyrocketing."
    Diaz said the PCGG would limit its probe to sequestered
stock in brewery giant San Miguel Corp, the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co, mining conglomerate Benguet Corp, and
Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corp.
    Shares of the four companies are among the most frequently
traded on the two stock exchanges.
    Diaz said at a meeting with the heads of the two exchanges
last Thursday that the PCGG would act prudently in its
investigation of street certificates, adding the panel
supported government efforts to create a favourable investment
climate.

<TITLE>KHOMEINI WARNS AGAINST INTERNAL DISSENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, warned the nation's civilian and military
hierarchy against discord and dissent, Tehran radio said.
    A report, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation, said he gave the warning in a speech to senior
government and military figures.
    He said Iranians should guard against internal dissent and
try to prevent it in a situation where foreign powers aimed to
"smash Islam...And destroy every one of us."
    His audience at a Tehran mosque included President Ali
Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Hojatoleslam
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, influential Speaker of the Majlis
(Parliament) as well as military leaders, the radio said.
    It quoted Khomeini as saying: "Everybody around us is
pursuing the aim of destroying us from within. They say things
like such-and-such happened at such-and-such a place, who is
fighting whom...These things have an impact, and if one does
not beg God for preservation from such evils, one may fall into
a trap."
    Urging support for Parliament and the armed forces,
Khomeini said it was a "religious duty" to control negative
feelings about others and to behave in a friendly way.
    "We must support the Majlis. The Majlis must take sides with
the nation. We must support the government and it must serve
the nation," he said. "We must support the armed forces...They,
too, should support you.
    Khomeini said there should not be "one faction on one side
and another on the other...The armed forces must be on the side
of the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Corps must support
the armed forces."

<TITLE>IMF ASSURES KENYA OF MAXIMUM HELP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has assured Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi it will continue
to give his country maximum support, the official Kenya News
Agency KNA said.
    It said IMF Managing director Michel Camdessus made the
pledge during talks with Moi in Washington yesterday.
    Earlier this month, Moi told parliament Kenya would face a
difficult balance of payments situation this year as a result
of falling income from coffee exports and a higher oil import
bill.
    Foreign bankers in Nairobi have said a new loan agreement
with the IMF would be Kenya's first option for dealing with the
expected deficit.
    According to KNA, Moi thanked Camdessus for the IMF's help
to Kenya during difficult times in the past.
    "Mr Camdessus assured president Moi that the IMF would
continue to give Kenya maximum help," it added.
    Moi pressed the U.S. To increase its level of aid to Kenya,
which fell to 53 mln dlrs this year from 111 mln in 1984, and
called for more U.S. Investment in the country.

<TITLE>SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled."
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified," he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement," he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability," he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC," Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures."
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions," Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.

<TITLE>IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT COCOA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture
Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new
international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be
present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.
    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened
by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on
Monday.
    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral
ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital
Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will
be present throughout the London talks, the official said.
    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that
he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public
mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low
world cocoa prices Friday.
    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new
pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the
world's cocoa exporters and consumers.
    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO
Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March
27.
    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the
pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market
hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.
    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international
cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked
hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.

<TITLE>TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tense trade relations with the U.S.
And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
tomorrow.
    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
tensions with major trading partners.
    The proposal is described by its promoters as a
stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
tax.
    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
costs.
    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
Iceland and Norway.
    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
the list of products affected.
    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
bill that would curb EC textile exports.
    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

<DATELINE>    JEDDAH, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Finance and
National Economy has started to issue an index to measure share
activity in the kingdom.
    An official of the Ministry's National Centre for Financial
and Economic Information said the weekly index, based on the
U.S. Standard and Poors Index, had been kept for over two years
but was only now being published.
    Measuring the prices of 48 companies currently traded in
Saudi Arabia, the index reached 68.72 points in the week ended
last March 5, down from the previous week's 69.50.
    It is divided into four subcategories -- agriculture which
stood at 99.03 points on March 5, industry at 54.44, services
at 76.93 and finance at 61.46.
    The ministry begun issuing the index at a time when the
situation is improving in the Saudi stock market after a
two-year decline.

<TITLE>SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABHA, Saudi Arabia, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian business
leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out
problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's
oil-dependent economy.
    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi
Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and
commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.
    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the
mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,
has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.
    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce
Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air
problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide
in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in
a private sector sorely short of finance.
    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private
enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.
    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle
East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing
and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.
    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord
reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost
prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the
turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a
52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down
foreign reserves.
    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of
confidence to the business community.
    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last
November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the
number of new non-performing loans.
    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate
finance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant to
lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am
not sure if it is firmly based."
    Some businessmen and bankers point out that government
spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy
may still be contracting.
    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.
A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the
budget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one of
the government's highest priorities, the recession, the
payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi
and foreign investor interest in industry."
    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a
major issue among the businessmen gathered here.
    Official figures show the number of new licences for
industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March
1986, compared with the same period in 1985.
    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major
source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.
    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge
inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.
    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.
Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached
agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.
    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels
conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a
draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of
bank debt.
    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely
to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to
step up investment in the kingdom.
    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after
holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi
outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft
worth five billion stg.

<TITLE>CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICE, France, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Automobiles Citroen expects rising
sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have
been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
in 1987, compared with 1986," he added.
    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA> group,
increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
11.7 pct in 1986.
    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
2.9 pct in 1986.
    "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us."
    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
its range and improve productivity.
    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
    This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain
about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."
    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
1,000 cars a day.
    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
    The AX had built up its market share in France to around
four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX
is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
of the national market."

year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.
    He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season
(November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet
local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of
570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage
to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.

<TITLE>LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading industrial nations will meet
again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
growth.
    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
likely to build on that stability.
    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
last month was the main reason markets were calm.
    But he said in an interview that financial markets also
understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures
to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
fact what has happened since Paris."
    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
agreement included a secret pact to consider further
coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
have taken jointly several times in the past year.
    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in
future international talks.
    "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
international fora," said the official, an Administration
economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the
continued conduct of our initiatives."
    But the official also said the Administration would resist
calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
    International monetary sources say finance ministers and
central bankers, who will review market performance and their
own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.
    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
the Fed was ready to follow suit.
    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
had been some change in approach on the part of the central
bank in Germany.
    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
the Fed and the Bundesbank.
    "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who
asked not to be identified.
    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
action could be on the April agenda.

<TITLE>HARPER AND ROW &lt;HPR> TO MULL OPTIONS AFTER BIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its
board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover
bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a
committee of independent directors to study strategic
alternatives for the 170-year-old firm.
    The alternatives include continuation of the company's
existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales
of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the
company.
    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on
the alternatives, Harper and Row added.
    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a
share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a
share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc &lt;HBJ>.
    After considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday,
the Harper and Row board decided not to act on them.
    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to
preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its
"considerable future prospects," according to director Winthrop
Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly
established independent committee.
    "However, given the significant current interest in the
company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the
options available. The committee will consider all the
pertinent facts and alternatives.... We intend to make a
careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to
a conclusion," Knowlton said.
    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has
postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that
had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to
recapitalize the company's stock to create two classes of
shares with different voting rights.

<TITLE>SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet economy recovered slightly
last month after a poor performance in January, but major
industries, including oil and machinery, are still short of
production targets, official figures show.
    Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly
Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output
was only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the
same period of last year.
    However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in
output of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted
to increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.
    The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met
their supply obligations in January and February.
    Production of oil, the country's main export to Western
nations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from
97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.
    Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured
into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse
the stagnation in production which began in November 1983.
    Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline
in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6
billion in 1985.
    Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets
were also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.
    Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally
bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality
controls imposed on enterprises.
    Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in
Moscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in
February but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of
the year compared with the same period of 1986.
    The figures showed that five republics produced less than
in the first two months of 1986.

<TITLE>PARIBAS PLAN TO ADJUST ECUADOR LOAN TERMS OPPOSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take about five months
to repair at a cost of some 150 mln dlrs.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damage caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that as
a result Ecuador would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Many banks in the Paribas facility, although sympathetic to
Ecuador's plight, feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organisations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad," one banker said.

<TITLE>EGYPT, SOVIET UNION TO RENEGOTIATE ARMS DEBT TERMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAIRO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected
to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three
billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.
    One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
repayment term.
    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.
    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
development plan ending June 30 1992.
    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint
and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
hardware, the officials said.
    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of
Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.
    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing
ally and turned to the U.S..

<TITLE>PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign
exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
in the country's international reserves, a government decree in
the Official Gazette said.
    Under the system, importers will be required to present a
bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to
decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.
    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.
    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
a council with members from the central bank, the economy
ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The
central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
accordance with guidelines set by the council.
    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in
1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.
   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against
2.97 billion in 1985.
   Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product
grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level
registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in
1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary
estimates.
    The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line
debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3
billion dlr foreign debt.

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA TO EXAMINE LATE CONTRACTOR PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABHA, Saudi Arabia, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Mohammed
Ali Abal-Khail said a committee will be set up to examine the
problem of late government payments to contractors and
companies operating in the kingdom.
    He told a working session on the first day of a
businessmen's conference yesterday that the committee, made up
of Finance Ministry and Chamber of Commerce officials, will be
formed shortly.
    He said the committee will also investigate disputes
between contractors and the government, but said the foreign
press had to some extent exaggerated payments problems.
    Abal-Khail said, "It is only natural that among those
thousands of contracts some problems perpetrated by disputes
over specifications, contractual obligations, project-handovers
and duration of contracts arose."
    Late payments, or in some cases total absence of payments,
have been a major source of concern for both the Saudi private
sector and foreign contractors operating in the kingdom.
    Businessmen said the minister's remarks were a rare
admission of problems in the contract sector and the first
concrete sign of government action to tackle payments delays.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SAYS U.S. WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States wants Taiwan's
currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus
with the U.S., A senior trade official said.
    Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters
on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week
that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would
face retaliation.
    Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S
responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export
quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with
the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.
    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year
limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.
    Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct
against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.
    It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking
a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.
Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.
    Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have
been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not
clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.

<DATELINE>    ABHA, Saudi Arabia, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's economy is
showing signs of picking up after problems last year caused by
the steep fall in oil prices, Commerce Minister Suleiman
Abdulaziz al-Salim said.
    Salim told a conference of Saudi businessmen the government
had taken a bold step to stimulate the economy by drawing down
more than 50 billion riyals of reserves in its 1987 budget.
    Salim said one tangible sign of that optimism had been a
strong rise in the price of Saudi shares. Some have gained by
more than 35 pct since last November.
    But the keynote speaker, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, accused
Saudi businessmen of ingratitude because they preferred to
invest abroad rather than in Saudi Arabia.
    The need to increase private investment in Saudi Arabia is
expected to be a major theme of the conference.
    Saudi Arabia's economic planners have long recognised the
need to stimulate the private sector and diversify the
oil-dependent economy.
    But despite the encouraging signals cited by Salim, some
businessmen and bankers said they are still sceptical about
prospects for the economy.

harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday.
    The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln
tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most
grain consumed by the farmers who grew it.
    The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said
it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in
different parts of the country.
    NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has
only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in
Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central
Tanzania.
    In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage
capacity, he added.
    Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos
in the main maize producing areas of Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma and
Rukwa.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES' ONGPIN OPTIMISTIC ON DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By ALAN WHEATLEY, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippines finance minister Jaime
Ongpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt
rescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors,
as he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.
    "One can never be too optimistic, but I'm cautiously
optimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close
to a deal," Ongpin told Reuters by telephone.
    He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late
Friday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other
members of the Philippine delegation.
    Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer
and bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next
meeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he
too was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly
by the end of the week.
    Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay
part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment
Notes, PINs, instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory
committee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the
concept as it was originally drafted, but the counter-proposal
made on Friday contains a revised version, bankers said.
    Manila, seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.2 billion, wants to pay the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs.
    These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a
discount to multi-national firms which would then convert them
at face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidized
pesos for use in funding government-approved investments.
    Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest
margin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign
exchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the
need to seek new bank loans.
    But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original
form, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.
    They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that
interest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other
debtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.
    Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that
his government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if
there was no buyer in the secondary market.
    Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this,
when senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with
Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy.
    But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was
still a sticking point.
    After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement
last month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR, some New York bankers
imediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new
benchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans, is current on
interest and is repaying some principal.
    The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the
third.

<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cabinet has approved a finance
ministry plan to raise the amount of outstanding government
bonds as a percentage of the total budget in financial year
1987/88 starting July 1, to meet growing demand for funds for
major construction projects, a cabinet official said.
    The increase would allow outstanding bonds to total 40 pct
of the 1987/88 budget, up from 25 pct in the current year.
    He said the increase would allow the government to issue
bonds worth up to about 105 billion Taiwan dlrs in the next
financial year, up from 49.6 billion in the current year. The
proposal will go to parliament for final approval.
    A finance ministry official told Reuters the increase in
bond issues was necessary to finance 14 major projects,
including highways, power plants, an underground railway and a
receiving terminal for liquefied natural gas.
    Spending on major projects is expected to total more than
120 billion Taiwan dlrs in 1987/88, compared to 89 billion in
the current year, he said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SEEN NARROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's current account deficit for
February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln
and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29
billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.
    Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.
    The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be
a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,
after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598
mln dlrs.
    As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose
about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.
    A lack of aircraft imports in February should also
contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to
remain in deficit, the economists said.
    Other positive influences on the current account balance
should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a
seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of
certain official aid payments, they said.
    They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an
eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the
0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless
the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
official newspaper said.
    The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
it proposes to pay for them.
    President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots
in which 15 people were killed.
    The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the
government about 500 mln kwacha per year.
    The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
    The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
    The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction
system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since
the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine
per dollar.
    Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.
    According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by
assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude
its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.
    The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its
talks with the government have taken longer than expected.

<TITLE>(CORRECTED)-IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture
Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new
international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be
present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.
    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened
by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on
Monday.
    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral
ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital
Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will
be present throughout the London talks, the official said.
    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that
he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public
mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low
world cocoa prices Friday.
    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new
pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the
world's cocoa exporters and consumers.
    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO
Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March
27.
    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the
pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market
hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.
    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international
cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked
hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.

<TITLE>TREASURY, FOREIGN RESERVES ARE JORDAN'S PRIORITIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMMAN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jordan's key economic priorities are
having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange
reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said.
    "First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when
dealing with the public and other countries so that its
credibility is preserved," he said in a television interview
Saturday.
    "The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of
foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and
confidence needed by the government to meet foreign
commitments."
    Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and
commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio
of 14.9 pct.
    The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars
in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to
latest Central Bank figures.
    Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists
here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies,
is overvalued.
    "The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve
its stability," he said.
    The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would
tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan.
Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to
receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates to help it resist Israel.
    But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others
failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA WELCOMES ACCORD ON NEW RUBBER PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik welcomed the basic accord reached over
the weekend in Geneva between producers and consumers on a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA).
    "This is a good development and if a new pact is adopted
this week it will augur well for the rubber industry and prices
in the long term," he told Reuters here.
    Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new INRA
resolved differences and agreed last Saturday on basic elements
for a new pact to replace the current one, which expires in
October.
    Conference Chairman Manaspas Xuto said legal drafting of
the new pact will begin this week and it is expected to be
formally adopted by some 40 countries on March 20.
    Malaysia, the world's top producer, acted as spokesman for
producers at the talks, which began on March 9.
    Malaysian traders said they expected prices to firm by a
few cents on the news that a pact is expected to be adopted.
    Prices will also firm in the short term because some
370,000 tonnes of rubber held in INRA buffer stock will not be
liquidated with a new pact in sight, they said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY NEEDS MORE INVESTMENT, BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia faces the risk of recession if
capital expenditure does not grow from the subdued levels of
recent years, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said.
    "Without stronger levels of capital expenditure, the
structural adjustment that is so critical to overcoming the
economy's fundamental problems cannot occur," the bank said its
latest Economic Newsletter.
    "In that event, Australia would be destined to experience a
prolonged period of sub-par growth at best, with the very real
risk that the onset of serious recession would become
unavoidable," it said.
    Australia's medium-term economic performance will be
fundamentally determined by business investment in the period
immediately ahead, the bank said.
    It said spending has been disappointing in recent years due
to low capacity utilisation, low expected profitability and
very high real interest rates.
    There also appears to be little likelihood of any
significant improvement for the present, it said.
    Investment is strongly influenced by medium-term
uncertainties and risks and these are likely to continue for
the present, it said.

<TITLE>VW CURRENCY LOSSES SEEN INVOLVING SEVERAL TRADERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The extraordinary foreign exchange
loss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders were
probably involved in the case, currency sources said.
    They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that
prosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to
Frankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.
    Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in
prosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency
hedging.
    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by
state prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW
currency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.
    The transactions were only possible, "because the culprits
possessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were
able to deceive controllers for years," the newspaper said.
    But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in
every bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily
be avoided.
    Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,
has resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.
    Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday
that foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed
and Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer
department, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller,
head of the central cash and currency clearing.
    Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended, but no charges have been laid.
    VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said
entire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in
forged transactions.
    Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers
discovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW
expected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian
National Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they
knew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were
forgeries.
    The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has
not commented on the affair.
    The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank
of Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders
and most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.
    It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to
renege on a genuine forward contract since this would
immediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from
operating further in the spot or forward currency markets.
    Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to
10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the
longer and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it
would be transacted with a domestic institution.
    Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW
has exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these
with most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through
currency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing
relatively little hedging, currency sources said.
    "They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading as
a bank," one senior dealer said.
    Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurred
because of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contracts
beginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.
    But the currency sources said market speculation was that
dollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that
the bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which
time around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar
fall continued.
    Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200
mln dlrs each were rare. Taking several in this size out with a
single bank would be easily spotted by financial controllers.
    One senior dealer for a German bank said, "There's no way
they can have hoped to get away with it. It's too big."
    The sources added that the involvement of the Federal
Criminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden could indicate that the
investigation would lead outside Germany.
    BKA has the mandate to handle criminal cases that may
involve foreign police forces or supranational services such as
Interpol. However the branch also handles cases that transcend
federal state borders within Germany.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>German banking authorities are
weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an
attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated
capital market instruments, banking sources said.
    Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are
under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may
resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To
Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of
banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British
proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.
    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to
produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.
    "There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter
stages," one representative of the German Banking Association in
Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.
    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West
Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal
Banking Supervisory Office.
    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes
would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has
been in effect since 1934.
    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit
present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary
political process of changing it, banking sources said.
    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited
banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,
on a consolidated basis.
    But lending ratios do not extend to several newer
instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,
currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,
currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies
and various innovative types of interest rate hedges.
    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals
lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,
and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps
than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities
agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on
how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.
    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of
formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in
swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial
intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.
This is the so-called market-to-market value.
    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too
complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of
lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of
the borrowers involved, the sources said.
    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended
to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public
authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign
banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.
    A further complication is that the more flexible
definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put
German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.
    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of
the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.
And British authorities, the sources said.
    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated
foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be
brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite
the fact that the risk may be entirely different.
    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was
uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and
applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in
order to lead-manage mark eurobonds.
    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending
ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,
particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they
are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,
the sources added.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the
yen around its current range, a senior central bank official
told reporters.
    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris
last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current
ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar
rise.
    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency
stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other
policies and with other central banks, he said.
    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability
will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but
declined to be more specific.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday
the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily
satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the
official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
changed from the performance expected this year.
    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
nearly one percentage point, he said.
    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
last year and a half.
    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
still be wet," he added.
    Liquidity among private households and especially the
corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
continue, he said.
    The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when
his current term expires later this year.
    "He's a great man," the official said, adding that more and
more people expect his reappointment.
    Turning to exchange rates, the official said the
substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect
on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the
impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the
U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so
far it has not been very strong, he said.

<TITLE>OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED SALES TAX SPREADS IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opposition to government plans to impose
a five pct sales tax is spreading nationwide ahead of the start
of campaigning for local elections next week, political
analysts said.
    The Asahi Shimbun said 31 of the 47 prefectural assemblies
had so far opposed, demanded amendments to, or expressed
wariness about the tax. Assemblymen from the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) have also joined the opposition against
the tax in 11 prefectural assemblies, the daily reported.
    About 2,600 elections will be held on April 12 and 26 for a
wide range of local posts, including 13 governors.
    The sales tax is one of the main planks of Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system.
    A close aide to Nakasone has said the sales tax issue will
have a minimal impact on the local elections because centrist
parties by and large support LDP candidates in many of the
races for governors. In the assembly elections, even LDP
candidates oppose the tax, he said.
    On March 8, the LDP lost an Upper House by-election in the
conservative stronghold of Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan
for the first time in 25 years. The opposition socialist winner
campaigned on the single issue of the sales tax.
    The surprise LDP defeat in Iwate, coupled with Nakasone's
sagging popularity, has forced the party to compromise with the
opposition and agree to postpone public hearings on the fiscal
1987/88 budget to March 19/20 from March 13/14.
    The opposition parties have been staging recurring
parliamentary boycotts to show their disapproval of the sales
tax contained in the budget. They returned to the Lower House
Budget Committee last Friday but walked out again after a few
hours, demanding detailed data on the tax. But parliamentary
sources said they are expected to agree in a day or two to
dispose of some of 29 bills the LDP will submit.
    The bills include nine which will become extinct on March
31 unless some action is taken, the sources said. These cover
such uncontroversial topics as wages for diplomats and
revisions of the law covering court employees.
    Discussion is also expected of a provisional budget to
allow the government to continue operating while debate on the
main budget continues beyond the April 1 start of fiscal
1987/88, the sources said. The provisional budget could cover
some 50 days and include authorisation for spending on some
public works. Otherwise, parliament will go into virtual recess
until local elections start on April 12, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUSINESS DECLINE SEEN BOTTOMING OUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The extended decline in Japan's overall
business performance was likely to bottom out in the current
January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the
stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it
said after carrying out a quarterly survey.
    The survey, conducted in February, was based on
questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all
sectors except the finance and insurance industries.
    The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to
turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase
in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a
5.4 pct decrease in the first half.
    Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of
fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.
    Manufacturers' earnings, hit hard by the yen's steady rise
against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987
after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it
said.
    Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise
11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after
growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey
said.
    It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such
as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from
the yen's appreciation.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>European sugar beet plantings are
expected to show little change from last year, despite recent
firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.
    A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,
so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower
areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.
    Trade analysts said their private reports give similar
results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate
of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West
German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.
    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural
experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved
seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.
In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late
boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing
starts to growing seasons.
    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers
will grow so-called "C" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world
market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area
needed to meet the EC "A" and "B" quotas, which receive full and
partial price support, respectively.
    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week
between producers and the EC commission over its export policy
could have serious implications for future sugar output.
    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly
one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as
they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for
the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.
    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,
this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting
higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future
cut in the basic "A" and "B" quotas, they added.
    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota
sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first
planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last
year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.
    "The basic trend is towards stability," a FIRS spokesman
said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white
sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not
encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output
last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00
tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands
but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.
    In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,
since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry
sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still
valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed
by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.
    Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a
reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.
    British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed
up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should
yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop
equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.
    British Sugar has "A" and "B" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes
of whites and its "C" output is due to improved yields from more
consistent disease-resistant seed types.
    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty
Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar
Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish
production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to
increase the area above the already signed contracted level.
    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put
plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in
1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.
    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or
Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to
the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'
association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but
surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially
in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.
    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher
than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.
    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a
record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes
into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest
Dutch sugar processor, said.
    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes
of white sugar and to cut output of "C" sugar. Last year, the
Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar
against a combined "A" and "B" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.
    "The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher
than it has done recently to make planned production of "C" sugar
really worthwhile," the spokesman said.
    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting
intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's
Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.
    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some
95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but
diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic
demand.
    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are
estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.
    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske
Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged
from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.
    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic
demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha
against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar
company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.
    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to
late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987
plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down
from 37,600 in 1986.

<TITLE>U.S. BANKER URGES FASTER JAPANESE LIBERALISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan should step up the pace of its
financial liberalisation if it wants to become a world
financial centre equal to New York or London, a leading U.S
banker said.
    "For Tokyo to become the third link in an international
capital markets triangle, it will need to create an environment
more hospitable to international finance than currently exists,"
Robert Binney, senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank
N.A., Told a group of Japanese members of parliament and
financial leaders.
    Binney said Japan must liberalise its financial markets not
just to attract more jobs, capital and taxable income, but also
to recycle effectively its vast trade surpluses to help counter
growing protectionism in the United States.
    He called on Japan to remove all controls on deposit
interest rates soon and to remove obstacles to the growth of
its offshore market. He also said it should fully deregulate
its short-term money markets, develop comprehensive futures
markets, further open the Tokyo Stock Exchange to foreign
membership and remove fixed rate brokerage commissions.
    Binney also urged Japan to abolish Article 25 of its
Securities and Exchange Law which, like the U.S. Glass Steagall
Act, separates commercial from investment banking.
    At the same meeting Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp president
Eugene Atkinson urged Japan to fully de-regulate short-term
interest rates, introduce commercial paper and open long-term
government bond markets to an auction system.
    He said Japan should allow securities firms to participate
in foreign exchange business and develop over-the-counter stock
options and futures. Short-selling of Japanese government cash
bonds was a vital hedging mechanism, he added.
    The group of some 60 Japanese legislators and financial
leaders which Atkinson and Binney addressed was recently formed
to study ways in which Japan should promote liberalisation of
its financial markets.
    "We should not leave such matters solely to government
bureaucrats," Masao Hori, Chairman of the lower house finance
committee, told the group.

    Turnout on the first day yesterday, about five pct lower

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH SHARE PROSPECTS MIXED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>While world exchanges revel in a
continuing securities boom, the Dutch stockmarket remains
lacklustre despite a series of largely positive annual
corporate results and signs of a more stable dollar, analysts
said.
    Prices and turnover on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange have
sprung back from lows reached when the dollar dipped below the
two guilder mark in January. But market analysts say only lower
interest rates or a further rise in the dollar, now trading at
around 2.09 guilders, could keep the momentum going.
    "Between end-1982 and end-1986 Dutch stocks rose by around
150 pct, but the dollar's sharp fall last year put the brake on
the bull market," said Philip Menco, analyst with bank CLN Oyens
en van Eeghen.
    The dollar's current level compares with an average in 1986
of 2.45 guilders, and 3.35 in 1985, official figures show.
    But Arjen Los, analyst with Dutch merchant bank Pierson,
Heldring en Pierson, sees room for some optimism,
   "The market is exaggerating the whole dollar affair. We've
seen the bottom of its decline. But what is lacking is a
stimulus on the interest rate front," he said.
    Analysts said they expected little impact from provincial
elections on Wednesday as the government's position was secure.
    "The scope for price rises in Dutch shares is narrow, given
the limited room for lower interest rates," said Los, adding the
Dutch market can currently only dream of returns of around 15
pct seen in rising markets elsewhere in Europe.
    "When the dollar slumped in the second half of 1986, U.S.
And U.K investors were heavy sellers of Dutch stock. They made
an enormous currency gain," Menco said.
    Finance Ministry figures show foreign investment in Dutch
stock last year fell by nearly half to 4.2 billion guilders.
    Los envisaged no significant revival of foreign interest in
the Dutch market. He saw the large, liquid Dutch pension funds
pursuing a more aggressive portfolio management policy while
continuing to invest in markets with weaker currencies.
    Outflows of non-bank Dutch capital totalled a record 21.4
billion guilders last year, 12.3 billion of which stemmed from
securities transactions.
    "Dutch institutions have been rallying to buoyant foreign
markets, but this season's results could coax some of them back
to the relatively underpriced Dutch market," Koos Ten Have of
Staal Bankiers said.
    Ten Have said Dutch price/earnings ratios based on
forecasts of 1987 results were broadly unchanged compared with
1986. With an average ratio of 10, they were still attractively
lower than shares of other exchanges, he added.
    He said the reliability of the strong guilder was a further
factor favouring Dutch stock investments.
    Senior bank economists said this week's official economic
forecast by the CPB planning agency painted a gloomy picture of
the Dutch economy but this would not shake investor confidence
in the Dutch business sector. The Dutch economy was doing
relatively well compared with other nations, they added.
    Analysts say most companies have fulfilled expectations,
while some firms, particularly in food and publishing,
surprised the market with continued solid profit growth despite
major dollar and sterling investments.
    Unexpectedly positive results from companies like Unilever
Plc-NV &lt;UN.AS>, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> and
Heineken NV &lt;HEIN.AS> were balanced by poor performances by the
three banks, which achieved higher profits partly by reducing
their risk provisions. Analysts still have doubts about the
insurance sector, and many companies stressed the negative
impact of lower currencies on their guilder earnings in 1986.
    Food and publishing are seen as major growth areas, despite
the fact many of these companies have significant activities in
the U.K and U.S.
    Food chain Ahold NV &lt;AHLN.AS> reported an 8.1 pct increase
in net 1986 profit but said it did not see profits growing in
1987 due to the uncertainty of the dollar.
    Turnover declined by 5.7 pct to 11.4 billion guilders.
About 1.5 billion guilders of this decline was due to the lower
dollar and one third of turnover volume was achieved in the
U.S.
    "Ahold is too cautious over the dollar," Los said. "As long as
such companies continue to maintain their U.S. Activities and
fund their expansion there, the negative influence is purely an
accounting effect."
    Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS> and Heineken also managed
handsome profit increases of 16.6 and 7.5 pct respectively,
while blaming disappointing turnover in their substantial
overseas activities on the lower dollar.
    Initial publishing results indicate a bumper year for
shares in this sector and ensure firm interest despite higher
price/earnings ratios, ranging from 12 to 14. REUTER

on the firm's 15-member board to nine from six.
    "We want to correct business practices," Ramon Diaz, chairman

Reuters.
    "Right now there are a lot of companies that keep so many
things from their shareholders and one of them is San Miguel,"
he said.
    A San Miguel spokesman declined comment.
    Diaz said New York investment bank Allen and Co Inc told
the PCGG it was interested in tendering for all outstanding SMC
stock, with the subsequent dispersal of 60 pct of the stock to
Filipino investors to comply with investment laws.
    He said Australian businessman and brewer Alan Bond and the
brewing company Elders IXL Ltd &lt;ELXA.S> were interested in
buying 40 pct each of SMC stock.
    He added that the PCGG wanted some foreign input but would
not allow foreign control of the brewing and food conglomerate,
the Philippines' biggest manufacturing concern.
    Diaz said the PCGG did not plan to remove SMC president
Andres Soriano from his family company.
    "He has tremendous prestige to run the company," Diaz said.
"We appreciate his management, but certainly some practices have
to be corrected."

to halt introduction of &lt;Seiko Epson Corp>'s NEC-compatible
personal computer series, which NEC alleges infringes
copyrights for NEC's 9801 V computer series, an NEC official
said.
    "We may have no choice but to take legal action," the NEC
official said.
    A Seiko Epson official said the company's PC 286 series,
the first NEC-compatible personal computer, does not infringe
on NEC copyrights. He said the company intends to go ahead with
plans to market the computers from late April.
    A Seiko Epson official said of the new machine, "It's
compatible with NEC's machine, so it appears similar. But our
intention was to develop an original machine."
    Industry analysts said NEC controls about 70 pct of the
domestic personal computer market.
    They said introduction of NEC-compatible machines could
start a price war and cut NEC's profits, as happened to IBM
following the introduction of IBM-compatible machines.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SWISS OPTIONS AND FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Preparations for the launch of a Swiss
options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely
electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,
according to members of the project team.
    The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)
is a new departure in that it will introduce an additional
range of financial instruments and electronic trading methods
to the traditionally conservative Swiss market.
    There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading
and clearing systems will be completely automated.
    The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,
follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle
and Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of
keen competition from London and Frankfurt.
    These innovations included the introduction last October of
continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single
continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to
supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at
the close of business, and experiments in electronic trading.
    Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching
covered warrants on the shares of other Swiss companies.
    "If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its
international prominence in portfolio management, our bankers
and fund managers must have the same modern instruments at
their disposal as their competitors," says Soffex president
Rudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The computer terminals on which business will be conducted
will be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many
Swiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.
    Formal applications are not due until next month but a
preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this
week showed strong interest in membership.
    "The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all
over the country has been very encouraging," says Philippe
Bollag of the project team.
    Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius
Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost
foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse
turnover generally.
    The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should
attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.
    Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss
banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.
    Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to
15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new
Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading
in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified
future date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.
    Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating
in the market through computer terminals in their own offices.
Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.
    Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage
firms with an office in Switzerland, while Clearing Members
must be recognised as banks under Swiss law.
    The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp
software and hardware, provides for the display of best bid and
offer prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous
negotiation of block orders and maintains members' order books.
    An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants to
gauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a
particular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic
clearing functions will be carried out overnight.
    Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the
100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures
markets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
    This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost
thousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffman-La Roche und
Co AG &lt;HOFZ.Z>, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were
quoted this week at 209,000 francs each.
    Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months
following the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,
July or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in
future if market liquidity permits.
    Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas
such as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory
and regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.
    Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were
enthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their
own involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.
    "We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will
require a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at a
major Swiss bank. "We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all
day at a screen where nobody shouts at you."
    Moving into traded options will also require considerable
investment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely
new dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and
some banks are already sending staff abroad for training.

    February price rises were mostly in housing, health,
education, entertainment and transport.
    Wage and price controls have been in force since August
1985. Officials said the controls have helped soften the effect
of a recent 10 pct devaluation of the shekel.

<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 250 mln dlr Philippine capital fund
will be launched shortly to encourage private sector
investment, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said in a report to
President Corazon Aquino on his first year in office.
    The First Philippine Capital Fund will be launched jointly
by New York investment house &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers> and the
International Finance Corp, an affiliate of the World Bank,
Ongpin said. He gave no date for the launch.
    Ongpin said the implementation of the fund had been delayed
by his government's negotiations to reschedule about 9.4
billion dlrs of its 27.8 billion dlr foreign debt.
    Craig Nalen, president of a U.S.-government backed Overseas
Private Investment Corp mission which visited Manila in
February, told reporters at the time the capital fund would
amount to at least 100 mln dlrs.
    Ongpin proposed the 250 mln dlr fund during a trip to the
United States last September.
    His plan called on private investors to raise funds to buy
discounted obligations of Philippine borrowers from creditors
and convert them to equity in local projects.

<TITLE>BOND DEFERS RIGHTS ISSUE, MULLS PROJECT PARTNERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Bond Corp International Ltd>, a
subsidiary of the Australian-based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd
&lt;BONA.S>, said it would defer its planned rights issue but
still wants the issue to be made before July 31.
    No date has been set for the issue, announced in January.
    In a document to shareholders, Bond Corp said the delay
follows its receipt of a 240 mln H.K. Dlr loan from its parent
company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond
Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.
    It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the
project, the company said.
    The January announcement said the rights issue would
finance Bond Corp's 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct
stake in HK-TVB Ltd &lt;TVBH.HK> from film magnate Run Run Shaw.
    The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led
by Sino Land Co Ltd &lt;SINO.HK> to buy a commercial complex that
is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.
    Bond International said in the document that except for the
240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal
resources and by selling an interest in the building.
    The payments must be completed by the end of 1987.
    Bond International has also sold several residential
buildings in Hong Kong's mid-levels district for a total of
68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.
    The flats were among the properties it bought last year
from Hongkong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HK> for 1.4 billion dlrs.
    Analysts said Bond International is heavily geared as it
has relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the Hongkong
Land properties and the HK-TVB shares.
    Bond International also said in the document that while it
plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the
HK-TVB shares as a long-term investment.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine government revenue is
expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from
79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's
performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at
least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax
reform measures announced last year.
    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)
this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have
committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct
from 1.3 billion in 1986.
    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base
included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in
1988. He gave no other details.
    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and
the volume of government securities sold to the private sector
have improved significantly. "In particular, short-term prime
interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down
to less than 10 pct," he said.
    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced
in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth
of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in
approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.
    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation
program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by
associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a
1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help
finance land reform.
    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion
pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed
companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.
    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to
obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program
from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and
bilateral aid donors.
    The government has said the land reform plan aims to
distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK ADDS MONEY MARKET LIQUIDITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank came into the domestic
money market to add temporary liquidity through federal
government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct,
dealers said.
    They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at
about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move.
It had been 3.80/90 on Friday.
    The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday
after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it
by other European central banks after currency interventions in
the framework of European Monetary System in January.
    Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers
expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out
funds for tax payments on behalf of clients.
    Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this
month, with the bulk being paid out next week.
    In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked
up reserves at the Bundesbank.
    On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0
billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well
above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve
holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion.
    The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of
around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required
daily average for the month.
    With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to
remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves
than is absolutely necessary.
    However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be
added next week to replace a facility expiring then could
somewhat offset the drain.
    The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4
billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said.

<TITLE>TOYOTA LIKELY TO NAME AMERICAN FIRMS AS SUPPLIERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> is likely to
name more American companies as suppliers of car parts for its
wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA Inc
(TMM), a Toyota official told Reuters.
    Toyota is studying the use of General Motors Corp's &lt;GM.N>
GM Delco Products as a supplier of motors for windshield wipers
and Illinois Tool Works Inc for window handles, he said.
Another U.S. Firm may be used to supply radiator tanks.
    Toyota had originally planned to use two Japanese companies
to supply the parts, Nippondenso Co Ltd &lt;DNOT.T> and Aisin
Seiki Co Ltd.
    Toyota is also considering some other U.S. Firms as
suppliers, but the spokesman declined to name them.
    Cars produced at Toyota's Kentucky plant will consist of 60
pct local content, instead of an earlier planned 50 pct, he
said. The plant is scheduled to start production in mid-1988
and have an annual capacity of 200,000 cars.
    Industry sources said the Toyota move was designed to head
off criticism that it was not using enough U.S. Company-made
parts at its Kentucky plant.

<TITLE>MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of
oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
    A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
its total production into floating storage.
    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
than that.
    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
further 25,000 bpd of "purchase crude."
    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
at official prices.
    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
various members.
    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
"other forms of hydrocarbons" which are marketed in package deals
with crude oil.

<TITLE>JAPAN BANKS FACE BIG LOSSES ON PERPETUAL FLOATERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese banks may have to realize
significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual
floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market,
bankers said.
    How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal year
ending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommended
by the Finance Ministry. Ministry sources said the Ministry has
yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing
the perpetual floating rate notes they hold.
    The notes are held by Japanese city, trust, long-term and
regional banks, including their overseas branches.
    Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset
portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the
others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the
current market price, whichever is lower, bankers said.
    With the market for such perpetuals non-existent, Finance
Ministry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal
quotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine
bank book losses.
    The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the
National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using
such quotations, one official said.
    Banks using current market prices alone to value their
holdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue
that the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next
year, bankers said.
    But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign
portfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said. The
acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price,
whatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in the
current fiscal year.

<TITLE>PEARSON CONCENTRATES ON FOUR SECTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L> said the recent
sale of its Fairey Engineering companies, in a 51.5 mln stg
management buy-out, was part of its policy of concentrating on
four key sectors.
    In a statement with its 1986 results, the company said its
information and entertainments sector's Financial Times, FT,
newspaper had record sales and profits.
    The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme,
with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new
plant in the London docklands next year.
    Its other key sectors are merchant banking, oil and china.
    Commenting on its Camco Inc oil service subsidiary, Pearson
said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary.
    The group has been acquiring oil properties in both the
U.S. And Britain which will begin to make a significant impact
on profits in the 1990s.
    Far East operations of fine china subsidiary Royal Doulton
Ltd are being expanded in the wake of record recent sales in
Japan, it added.
    Pearson reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 121.1 mln stg, up
from 109.3 mln in 1985. Turnover fell to 953 mln from 970 mln.

Railway Corp> is planning a new line to link up the existing
railroad with the new light rail system now under construction,
a company spokeswoman said.
    She said the 14.9-kilometre link will connect the two
independent lines in the northern part of the suburban area
near the China border. It is not yet decided whether a light
rail system or a conventional system will be used for the link.
    The link, which will take about 3-1/2 years to complete, is
expected to cost 1.26 billion H.K. Dlrs, she said.
    The spokeswoman said the final decision on the link is up
to the government, depending on the government's overall
transport and development policy.
    She said consultancy studies commissioned by the company
show that by 1996 the new link will carry 137,100 passengers
daily and generate an additional 50,000 passengers in the
conventional railway system.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German central bank money stock
was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged
from the 7.5 pct reported in January, provisional data from the
Bundesbank showed.
    The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set
by the Bundesbank for 1987.
    In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks
in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month.
    The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6
pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct
rise in the same period to January.
    Of the two components comprising central bank money stock,
cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February
from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed.
    This gave an annualized 8.3 pct rise over the six months to
February, down from a 10.2 pct increase over the six months to
January.
    Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew
to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in
January.
    This yielded an annualized 8.8 pct rise over the six month
to February, up slightly from an 8.6 pct increase over the same
period to January.

<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold is expected to continue its rise
this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in
the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil
prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing
inflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crude
oil producer.
    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed
the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross
national products, it said.
    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased
industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank
said.
    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on
futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South
Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a
temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,
underline the firmer sentiment, it said.
    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90
tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.

provisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after
falling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the
Department of Trade and Industry show.
    The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a

    In the three months from December to February, the level of
sales was little changed over the previous three months but was
nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period.
    On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in
February were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier.
    The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the
average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the
January index, which was depressed by the effects of severe
weather.
    The February trading period comprised the four weeks
February 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be

<TITLE>COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The credibility of government efforts to
stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the
test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a
buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government
delegates and trade experts said.
    Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when
International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on
how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many
of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to
agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.
    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the
International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses
running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting
a shadow over commodity negotiations.
    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to
compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts
with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear
lines drawn between aid and trade.
    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic
elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in
Geneva at the weekend.
    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa
Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with
quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to
be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would
"distort, not support" the market.
    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO
for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee
prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can
founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa
futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has
also contributed to the recent slip in prices.
    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the
"must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,
which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but
without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.
    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should
operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement
limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it
cannot operate on futures markets.
    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost
100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or
selling operations, were carried forward from the previous
agreement.
    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on
all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.
    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on
buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be
over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should
pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working
group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative
matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.
    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds
should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member
countries such as Malaysia.
    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer
stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate
manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.
    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked
to the one over differentials for different qualities.
    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a
compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can
represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures
market's existing differentials for different qualities.
    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto
the London market.
    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50
stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.
    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would
operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the
highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.
    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the
European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France
siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session
in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground
and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions
among the 12 nations.
    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of
flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and
will be able to respond if they are there.
    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split
said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and
backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the
market where trade buying is not."
    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their
cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.
    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include
whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced
"posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is
buying then accepting offers.
    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that
producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of
cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a
way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

has won a two-year license from the Hong Kong government to
operate scheduled flights to Toronto, a Cathay spokesman said.
    He told Reuters the airline had sought a five-year right to
add Toronto to its existing license to serve the United States
and Canada.
    "We're pleased," the spokesman said. "It's important because
Toronto has a large ethnic Chinese commmunity and there's a
growing amount of travel."
    Canadian and British authorities must agree on air service
rights before Cathay can begin service to toronto.
    Cathay Pacific is controlled by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.

    Hongkong Dragon Airlines Ltd, a fledgling locally  based
airline, had opposed the move, saying that Cathay should wait
until its license for its U.S. And Canadian routes expires in
February next year.
    A hearing started today and continues tomorrow. An
application by Dragonair is to start flights to Malaysian
cities including Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. Cathay is
opposing Dragonair's request.

    The Conservatives, who hold 44 seats in Parliament, have
shelved plans to privatise state industry in order to improve

<TITLE>SCIENTIST ALLAYS FEARS ABOUT CHERNOBYL POLLUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Radioactive contamination of water
supplies around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will not
reach danger levels when the winter snowfall starts to melt, a
Soviet scientist was quoted as saying at the weekend.
    Konstantin Sytnik, vice-president of the Ukrainian Academy
of Sciences, said there had been fears that melted snow
containing radioactive particles might flow into main water
supplies.
    But he told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda that
contamination of snow around the plant was within safety levels
and some of it had already been absorbed into the soil.
    Snowfall this winter had been greater than usual and a
certain increase in the amount of radiation in the water was
inevitable. But contamination would be within the permissible
limits, Sytnik said.
    The banks of the river Pripyat, which flows near the plant,
had been reinforced to prevent it bursting its banks when the
thaw began this spring, he added.
    About 135,000 people were evacuated and 31 were killed
after an explosion and fire at Chernobyl last April 26. A
concrete wall was built last summer to prevent contamination of
the Pripyat by radioactive ground water.
    Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official was quoted as saying today
that preparations were under way in the Ukraine to evacuate
towns and villages before there was heavy flooding after higher
than usual snowfall this winter.
    V. Martynenko, head of a flood commission in the Donbass
area of the Ukraine, told Pravda preparations had begun for the
evacuation of about 112,000 people in the Donbass in the south
of the republic. About 190 towns and villages and 12,000 homes
could be flooded when snow -- falls of which had been six times
higher than usual in some areas -- started to thaw. Cattle had
already been moved from some parts, they said.

<TITLE>PANEL HEAD SAYS MARCOS STILL CONTROLS LARGE FUNDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The head of a Philippine panel charged
with recovering illegal wealth accumulated by former President
Ferdinand Marcos and his associates said they still controlled
large funds circulating in the country's economy.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters in an interview: "There is every
reason to believe that the cronies and President Marcos and his
family were able to hide millions and millions of pesos before
they fled. As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold of
crates of newly printed currency."
    Diaz did not give figures, but said: "We believe they still
have a lot of funds. These are the funds that they will use in
the coming elections. These are the funds that they used to
stage those coups."
    He was referring to congressional elections scheduled for
May 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by President
Corazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.
    Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and property
valued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered shares
of stock of at least 286 firms. "We have achieved more than what
we thought we could achieve in one year," he added.
    The government last week announced that businessman Antonio
Floirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the "banana king," had
turned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised to
surrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worth
another 180 mln pesos. In return, the PCGG said it had lifted
freeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.
    Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreements
with another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. He said
Benedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers and
radio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of the
boards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.
    Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth on
income-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.
"Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we have
to recover," he said.
    He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe street
certificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchanges
was prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were in
circulation.
    Street certificates describe securities held in the name of
a broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as to
permit easy trading or transfer.

government established a buffer stock of the country's staple
food.
    Rice imports increased to 82.4 billion Malagasy francs
during the first nine months of last year from 20 billion in
the same period of 1985, the ministry said, without disclosing
the tonnages involved.

    National Bank managing director Laszlo Karczag told
Reuters, "All our businesses (with Volkswagen) had been closed

do not have ... Any open or unsettled positions whatsoever with

    Karczag said the bank was in contact with Volkswagen and

    The West German weekly Der Speigel said a fraud involving
VW's reported 480 mln mark loss on foreign exchange dealings
came to light when the Hungarian National Bank refused to
honour what turned out to be a fake forward currency purchase
contract.
    Reading a prepared statement, Korczag said, "We have
knowledge, however, of the fact that in certain fraudulent
contracts the name of the National Bank of Hungary has also
been misused. We deny any kind of misconduct on our part."
    The bank had been doing foreign exchange business with
Volkswagen "for a few years," he said.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
billion dlr foreign debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

<TITLE>PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organizations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad," one banker commented.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the
yen around its current range, a senior central bank official
told reporters.
    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris
last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current
ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar
rise.
    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency
stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other
policies and with other central banks, he said.
    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability
will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but
declined to be more specific.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday
the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily
satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the
official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
changed from the performance expected this year.
    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
nearly one percentage point, he said.
    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
last year and a half.
    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
still be wet," he added.
    Liquidity among private households and especially the
corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
continue, he said.

<TITLE>SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled."
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified," he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement," he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability," he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC," Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures."
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions," Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.

increased imports from Western countries, figures from the
State Statistics Institute show.
    Exports were down 6.3 pct at 7.45 billion dlrs, compared
with 7.95 billion in 1985, while imports were down 2.1 pct at
11.10 billion dlrs from 11.34 billion.
    Total trade with Mid-East Gulf states fell some 40 pct due
to lower oil prices, with imports at 1.55 billion dlrs,
compared with 2.74 billion, and exports at 1.65 billion after
2.72 billion.
    Exports to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development countries rose to 4.29 billion dlrs from 4.11
billion in 1985, while imports were 4.56 billion after 3.55
billion.
    Turkey's trade deficit in December narrowed to 216 mln dlrs
from 340 mln in November, and compared with 277 mln in December
1985.

Registered shares were less affected, slipping five to 165. The
participation certificates fell to 43 francs from 45.50.
    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln francs, after a
restated 756 mln loss in 1985, and set a 50 pct capital cut.
The company said it could break even this year.

<TITLE>EGYPT, SOVIETS TO RENEGOTIATE ARMS DEBT TERMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAIRO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected
to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three
billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.
    One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
repayment term.
    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.
    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
development plan ending June 30 1992.
    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint
and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
hardware, the officials said.
    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of
Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.
    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing
ally and turned to the U.S..

<TITLE>PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru will put into effect today a foreign
exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
in the country's international reserves, a government decree in
the Official Gazette said.
    Under the system, importers will be required to present a
bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to
decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.
    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.
    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
a council with members from the central bank, the economy
ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The
central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
accordance with guidelines set by the council.
    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in
1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.
   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against
2.97 billion in 1985.

<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States wants Taiwan's
currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus
with the U.S., A senior trade official said.
    Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters
on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week
that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would
face retaliation.
    Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S
responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export
quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with
the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.
    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year
limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.
    Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct
against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.
    It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking
a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.
Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.
    Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have
been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not
clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.

before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, state-oil company
Petrobras said in a statement.
    Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil
credit guarantees.
    Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of
credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had
demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading
international banks.
    Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did
not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the
purchase of oil with other producers.
    The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln
barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.
    The shipment was part of a contract signed in February for
the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until
June.

<TITLE>U.K. AND GERMANY LEAD ATTACK ON EC FARM REFORMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Mylrea, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain and West Germany told their
European Community partners they would strongly oppose major
elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.
    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a
full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has
already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led
protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.
    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will
advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance
other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.
    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter
this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the
president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put
forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC
cash crisis.
    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals
production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a
proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -
a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out
foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.
    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German
farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to
export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all
other 11 EC states, diplomats said.
    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose
a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it
could seriously damage EC trade relations.
    The diplomats said the United States had been the most
outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it
as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body
GATT.
    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,
such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,
Iceland and Norway, they added.
    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm
reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that
could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.
    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on
either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,
diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that
neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for
substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this
month, they added.

<TITLE>HARPER AND ROW &lt;HPR> TO MULL OPTIONS AFTER BIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its
board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover
bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a
committee of independent directors to study strategic
alternatives for the 170-year-old firm.
    The alternatives include continuation of the company's
existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales
of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the
company.
    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on
the alternatives, Harper and Row added.
    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a
share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a
share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc &lt;HBJ>.
    After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting on
Friday, the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them.
    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to
preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its
"considerable future prospects," according to director Winthrop
Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly
established independent committee.
    "However, given the significant current interest in the
company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the
options available. The committee will consider all the
pertinent facts and alternatives... We intend to make a careful
and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a
conclusion," Knowlton said.
    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has
postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that
had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to
recapitalize the company's stock in order to create two classes
of shares with different votinmg rights.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill
this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt
a trade war.
    "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as
I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in
a weekend television interview.
    "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill
out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to
work together with the administration, but there is a hardening
trade attitude," he said.
    President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but
agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that
opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.
    However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize
trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for
failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead
to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any
such bill.
    When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade
war, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any question
about that."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading industrial nations will meet
again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
growth.
    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
likely to build on that stability.
    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
last month was the main reason markets were calm.
    But he said in an interview that financial markets also
understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures
to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
fact what has happened since Paris."
    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
agreement included a secret pact to consider further
coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
have taken jointly several times in the past year.
    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future
international talks.
    "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
international fora," said the official, an Administration
economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the
continued conduct of our initiatives."
    But the official also said the Administration would resist
calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
    Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret 
short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific
agreement to defend those bands with intervention.
    According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to
1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.
    There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were
set, although the agreement used the term "ranges", for the first
time in an international economic agreement.
    The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to
foster currency stability around current levels.
    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
    International monetary sources say finance ministers and
central bankers, who will review market performance and their
own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.
    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
the Fed was ready to follow suit.
    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
had been some change in approach on the part of the central
bank in Germany.
    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
the Fed and the Bundesbank.
    "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who
asked not to be identified.
    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
action could be on the April agenda.

owns 9.9 pct of Calny stock, for 11.50 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by PepsiCo and Calny boards and Calny shareholders.
    The company said its board intendsd to schedule a meeting

and advise Calny on its alternatives.
    Calny is the largest franchisee of PepsiCo's Taco Bell

Washington as well as 15 La Petite Boulangerie bakeries in
Seattle.
    Calny earned 1,192,000 dlrs on sales of 56.2 mln dlrs for
the nine months ended November Four.
    On December Four, Calny rejected as inadequate an investor
group led by former president and chairman Robert A. Larive's
second offer to acquire it because the bid was inadeuqate and
subject to too many contingencies.  The group offered 11.50
dlrs and one dlr of 10 pct preferred stock per Calny share.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES' ONGPIN OPTIMISTIC ON DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippines finance minister Jaime
Ongpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt
rescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors,
as he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.
    "One can never be too optimistic, but I'm cautiously
optimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close
to a deal," Ongpin told Reuters by telephone.
    He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late
Friday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other
members of the Philippine delegation.
    Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer
and bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next
meeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he
too was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly
by the end of the week.
    Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay
part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment
Notes, PINs, instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory
committee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the
concept as it was originally drafted, but the counter-proposal
made on Friday contains a revised version, bankers said.
    Manila, seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.2 billion, wants to pay the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs.
    These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a
discount to multi-national firms which would then convert them
at face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidized
pesos for use in funding government-approved investments.
    Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest
margin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign
exchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the
need to seek new bank loans.
    But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original
form, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.
    They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that
interest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other
debtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.
    Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that
his government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if
there was no buyer in the secondary market.
    Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this,
when senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with
Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy.
    But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was
still a sticking point.
    After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement
last month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR, some New York bankers
imediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new
benchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans, is current on
interest and is repaying some principal.
    The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the
third.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/EASTERN AIRLINES &lt;TEX></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Matt Spetalnick, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Miami, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffs
and management overtures for wage concessions have set the
stage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,
analysts and labor leaders say.
    The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts to
revive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,
Eastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to its
non-union sister airlines, analysts said.
    "It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if things
get bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting them
over Continental Airlines," said Louis Marckesano, an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.
    Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts see
little chance of the carrier returning to profitability this
year.
    Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Air
last year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees has
plummeted, workers and labor leaders say.
    Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that morale
problems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline in
customer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.
    Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many of
them newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- of
conducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at
ridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.
    "It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people out
in an attempt to cut the company's labor costs," said Nancy
Tauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.
    Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalked
by what they call "spyriders" -- teams of auditors they say
have been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretly
examine flight crew performance.
    Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flight
attendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some for
having as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales and
movie headset rentals, Tauss said.
    Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tightening
its accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,
which the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the 
highest in the industry.
    But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-base
airline was using unfair labor tactics. "We're just trying to
correct long-standing problems and that causes some
dissatisfaction," he said.
    U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met with
groups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and is
reported to have told them he may call for hearings on the
airline's labor tactics.
    Labor and management have a long history of bitter
relations at Eastern Airlines.
    But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,
when Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of
490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly through
union concessions.
    Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands for
wage cuts and have refused to open their contracts for
renegotiation.
    Union officials say that in retaliation for their
resistance, the airline has launched a "firing frenzy" aimed at
intimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.
    During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumed
control of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.  That
was nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said. In the
first two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing their
jobs, according to union records.
    Other unions report similar losses.
    Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern's
wide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.
    Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repair
its planes in several cities and plans to shut down some
maintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.
    "Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern to
underwrite an outmoded labor cost structure," Bakes told a
meeting of Miami businessmen this month. He denied, however,
that Lorenzo planned to strip Eastern of its assets.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/DESKTOP PUBLISHING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Catherine Arnst, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>This month's endorsement by
International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> of two desktop
publishing software products should add some much-needed
standards to one of the fastest growing segments of the
computer industry, analysts say.
    Desktop publishing is a relatively new market but industry
analysts estimate that sales will reach one billion dlrs this
year and jump to six billion dlrs by 1990, fueled by the rush
of corporations to bring their printing and publishing needs
in-house rather than to more expensive outside printers.
    Printing is a big expense for most companies. Analysts
estimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct of
their total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.
    At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier this
month, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscript
typesetting language in future electronic printing products.
IBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windows
operating environment as the graphics interface standard in
future publishing announcements rather than its own Topview
environment.
    "IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to the
development of the desktop publishing market," said David
Goodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.
    "It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products that
are already available without being afraid that they will not
be compatible with whatever IBM does," he said.
    The advent of personal computers, laser printers and
graphics software has allowed users to design and print
brochures, newsletters and a host of other communications at
their desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printing
firm. Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktop
publishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computer
four years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellent
graphics capabilities.
     Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, Apollo
Computer Inc and a number of other vendors have identified
desktop publishing as a major growth area. IBM entered the
market only last July when it formed its Publishing Systems
Business Unit. IBM's embrace of the already-widely used
Postscript, a language that interprets computer commands and
translates them into instructions for the printer, was an
acknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.
    Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems said
the support of the world's largest computer maker was critical
to the language's ultimate acceptance by users.
    John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,
said, "Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktop
publishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for an
IBM announcement."
    IBM entered a licensing pact with Adobe for Postscript, but
its support of Windows was not quite so broad. IBM recognizes
Windows as a standard but would not comment on the extent of
its commitment to the software.
    Windows, a program integrator, allows personal computer
users to run a number of different applications simultaneously.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - BANK PAPER PRESSURED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Debt securities issued by major U.S.
banks are under pressure in the secondary market as investors
shy away from the paper because of Brazil's suspension of
interest payments last month, analysts and traders said.
    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks.
No date was established for the renewal of payments.
    "Buyers have backed away from bank paper. These securities
have become very difficult to sell despite a rise in their
yields," said one corporate bond trader.
    "Debt issues of major money center banks will probably
continue to trade off until such time as the Brazil situation
is resolved," said Loretta Neuhaus, a vice president with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    "I have not told any of our investors to stay away from the
banks in general," she added. "But I have not received too many
inquiries by prospective buyers lately either."
    Traders said debt securities of U.S. banks that are
perceived by investors to be heavily exposed to Latin American
debtor nations declined moderately in price last week. They
said the difference between bids and offers widened.
    "There is not much trading of bank issues these days," an
underwriter said, referring to the wider bid/offer spreads.
    However, he and others pointed out that the secondary
market has not seen heavy selling by institutions, funds and
other investors.
    "The selling has been steady over the past couple of weeks.
But it has been far from panicky," said another trader.
    In addition, institutional sources told Reuters on Friday
that Salomon Brothers Inc lowered its investment ratings on the
stocks of all U.S. money centers. But the sources said it is
understood the action is not a sell recommendation.
    While institutional sources said Salomon lowered the
ratings to M from O-plus on bank stocks, bond traders said this
carried over to the secondary market and further undermined
confidence in bank paper.
    The banks affected by Salomon's change in investment coding
were Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK>, Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, Chase
Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB>, Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL>, Citicorp
&lt;CCI>, Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>,
J.P. Morgan and Co Inc &lt;JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>,
Republic New York Corp &lt;RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp &lt;BKB> and
First Chicago Corp &lt;FNB>, sources said.
    The institutional sources said Salomon cited a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission by Citibank, the lead
bank of Citicorp.
    Citibank said Friday it told the SEC its earnings could be
reduced by 50 mln dlrs after-tax in the first quarter, and 190
mln dlrs in the year, if it has to declare 3.9 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term Brazilian loans non-performing.
    "I believe there will be some renegotiation along the way
between Brazil and the banks such that the banks will not have
to charge off their loans to Brazil," Merrill Lynch's Neuhaus
commented.
    But until then, investors are widely expected to remain
leery of buying bank paper, according to analysts and traders.
    In an unrelated development, RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR> paid
what some bond traders said amounted to a "penalty fee" when
the company tapped the domestic debt market on Friday.
    RJR Nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of sinking fund debentures
due 2017 via lead manager Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The
debentures had an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at 98.675 to
yield 8-3/4 pct, or 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4
pct Treasury bonds of 2016. The yield and premium over
Treasuries was greater than a similar financing in January.
    On January 22 Nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of same-maturity,
same-rated sinking fund debentures priced to yield 8.62 pct, or
107 basis points over the 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds.
    Both issues were rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S and P.
    Bond traders noted that Nabisco has called for redemption
around 1.2 billion dlrs of its 11.20 pct notes of 1997. Nabisco
will buy them back at 107.50, traders said.
    "The redemption of an attractive double-digit yield issues
has tainted Nabisco in investors' eyes," said one trader.
"Obviously, a lot of prospective buyers believe Nabisco should
pay a higher yield because of that."
    Traders also asserted that the higher yield in Friday's
pricing reflected the total debt issuance of one billion dlrs
so far this year by Nabisco.
    "Investors may be showing some signs of indigestion,"
remarked one trader. Traders said they expect Nabisco will
float more debt in the coming weeks to finance the redemption
of the 11.20 pct notes.
    Officers on Shearson's syndicate desk declined to comment.
    IDD Information Service said the 30-day corporate visible

<TITLE>INDONESIA HAS IMPORTED PALM OIL, TRADERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia has imported palm oil this
year and is likely to take more, trade sources said.
    They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a
Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued
licences to import the commodity. He also said there was no
sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia.
    A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil
to Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this
month and other vessels had been earmarked for April.
    Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for
Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages.
    Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had
been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said
licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude
palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and
RBD oil.
    Last week there were rumours in European markets that
Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes
of palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian
Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect.
    Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said
they could include those issued earlier this year and
applications not yet granted.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A year after squeezing to power with a
narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
choking the French economy.
    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
recovery the government says will follow from its free market
policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
in 1986, is uncertain.
    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
miracle may be running out.
    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
elections due by April next year.
    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
reviews from non-partisan analysts.
    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
achievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectual
revolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
state control.
    "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
excellent," Develle said.
    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
architect of the government's free market policies, may be
pursuing a mirage.
    "The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
explosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chief
economist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion.
Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."
    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
and industries to private investors.
    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state
companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
franc five-year privatisation plan.
    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
December.
    At the end of last year the government abolished price
controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
less.
    "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
consider that prices are now free for the first time since
1945," commented Develle of Paribas.
    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
since Chirac took power.
    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
wanted.
    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
sectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adapted
to demand" and over-priced, the report said.
    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
with the report. "One of the assumptions of the government is
that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.
    And despite rising industrial investment and the
introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
    The problem for the government is that there may be little
more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
West Germany and Japan, they say.

<DATELINE>    HANOVER, Mass., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spectra Pharmaceutical Services

Tretinoin have not produced encouraging results based on
preliminary indications.
    The compnay said the tests are being conducted for
submission to the Food and Drug Administration for the drug
which has the trade name Lacramore.
    Spectra said earlier studies showing dramatic improvements
in isolated cases have still occurred. However, the overall
evaluation of a large number of patients with dry eye syndrome
do not demonstrate consistantly beneficial results, it added.
    Spectra said it will continue its current studies, while at
the same time undertaking a review of the feasability of the
proposed product
    Spectra, a development stage company, also said it has
introduced its first proprietary product, a hyo-allergenic
noniirritating cleanser for the cleaning of eyelids and
eyelashes.
    The company said it has also begun marketing a line of
ophthalmic drugs.

Attendants said U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs entered a
temporary restraining order prohibiting Trans World Airlines
Inc from refusing to recognize and deal with the union.
    The union said the order also prohibits TWA from denying
union representatives access to the company's property.
    The union said the Kansas City judge acted on its
complaints made seeking to enforce a recent U.S. Court of
Appreals decision reinstating contractural provisions which
existed at the time of the 70-day strike which ended in May
1986.
    The flight attendants union said it petitioned the district
court because of TWA's ongoing refusal to allow union
representatives on the airline's property.
    The union said the court order also requires TWA to post
notices of a temporary restraining order throughout its system
and to districute copies of the order to all its
flight-attendant employees.
    The union said the order requires the airline to appear in
U.S. District Court in Kansas City March 20 to show cause why a
preliminary injunction should not be granted.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold is expected to continue its rise
this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in
the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil
prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to
growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.
    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed
central bank limits and real growth of their gross national
products, it added.
    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased
industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank
said.
    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on
futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.
    These factors and South Africa's unstable political
situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold
supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it
said.
    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90
tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's ruling Conservatives have a
nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their
biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday in the Sunday Times.
    The MORI poll's findings were the latest in a series of
setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.
    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against
32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall
majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. The poll
follows a survey by Marplan last week giving the Conservatives
a six-point lead over Labour.

<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banca della Svizzera Italiana &lt;BISZ.Z>
said it expected business to be good again this year after
1986's 15.2 pct increase in net profit to 42 mln Swiss francs.
    Chief Executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told reporters he
expected almost all important sectors to expand well in 1987.
An important exception would be its securities business, which
would grow more slowly.
    Ghiringhelli also said the bank planned to convert its
representation in London into a subsidiary at the end of this
year and further expand activities at its New York subsidiary,
particularly in private banking.

<DATELINE>    CAMPINAS, Brazil, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian bank workers voted
to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour
unrest arising from the failure of the government's
anti-inflation plan.
    At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao
Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24
unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.
    Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national
confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions
representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite
stoppage would affect all banks.
    The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third
week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the
state-owned petroleum company Petrobras.

<TITLE>AVIA STOCKHOLDERS SEEK TO BLOCK SALE TO REEBOK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PORTLAND, Ore., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Avia Group International Inc> 
stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County
Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok
International Ltd &lt;RBOK>.
    Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from
the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according
to court papers.
    The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied
minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of
Reebok's proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in
the price of Avia stock.
    The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a
Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert
Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and
other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok's
announcement. A jury trial has been requested.
    "The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt
the little guy," said Eischen.
    The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized
a steering committee.
    The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from
March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between
19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to
16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.
    The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from
proceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also
requests damages to be determined at the time of trial.
    Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had
no comment on the suit.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS STALL ON FOOD SUBSIDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
official newspaper said.
    The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
it proposes to pay for them.
    President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots.
    The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
quell the disturbances.
    The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
    The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
    The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction,
losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of
January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.
    Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.

    National newspapers in Belgrade have given few details of

    Western diplomats said the strikes appeared to be

<TITLE>H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Light, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>With the April 15 tax return deadline
less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
    Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
"bonanza," analysts say.
    "For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
President Tom Bloch said in an interview. "When Congress
drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
benefit," Bloch said.
    "Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'" he said.
"Tax forms will look very different next year," he added.
    Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
    "Next year, Block could have a bonanza," Buchbinder said.
Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
    The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
to the IRS.
    For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
effect, Bloch conceded.
    Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
tax rolls, he said.
    Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
said.
    Block expects "some expansion" this tax season of its
electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by
how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.
    The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly
filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in
the 1986 tax season.
    First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
    Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the
same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
television ads. "They may get a little more bang for their
buck," he said.
    He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
be of great benefit to them.

<TITLE>DART SEEKS SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> NEGOTIATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, Md., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dart Group Inc> said it is
preparted to negotiate all terms of its proposed acquisition of
Supermarkets General Corp.
    Early this month, Dart made an unsolicited offer of 41.75
dlrs a share in cash for Supermarkets General's stock.
    Releasing a letter sent friday to Supermarkets General,
Dart said "we believe that an agreement can be reached which
will be in the best interests of Supermarkets General, its
stockholders, management, employees and customers.
    "To that end, we are prepared to negotiate all terms of an
acquisition agreement," Dart said.
    Dart said it urges a meeting with Supermarkets General
officials be held promptly.
    The letter pointed out the company has not heard from
Supermarkets General since making the offer "other than on this
past Monday when we were informed that our offer would be
seriously considered and that you would get back to us on a
timely basis to arrange a meeting."
    Dart said it has "acted openly and amicably" in an effort
to facilitate its proposed acquisition, adding it has not
purchased additional Supermarkets General stock since prior to
submission of its offer.
    Dart said it continues to be interested in acquiring
Supermarkets General in a friendly manner, noting it has given
the company "the tune that you suggested in order to allow you
to evaluate the available options."
    Dart now owns 1.9 mln Supermarkets General shares, slightly
less than five pct of those outstanding.

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreage
provision, or "decoupling," for 1987 grain crops.
    "I think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92)
passed, (but) not for 1987 crops. It's too late," Lyng told the
National Grain and Feed Association convention here.
    Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for
0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will be
passed as part of a pending disaster bill.
    But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to
alter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closes
the end of this month.
    Overall, Lyng predicted very little change will be
legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German exports to the United
States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the
first time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.
    The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in
January, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the
lowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July
1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986.
    Total West German exports to Western industrialised
countries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from
December's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total
since July 1984.
    West German exports to the European Community were 21.60
billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December
and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.
    Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned
economies also slackened.
    Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus
of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe
because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.
    This was one of the strengths of West German exports
compared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S.,
OPEC and developing country markets, it added.

<TITLE>TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
full House of Representatives in late April.
    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of
legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
    This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
agreements or keep out U.S. products.
     On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance
to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in
trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating
powers.
    Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's
bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in
all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among
trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans
would ultimately endorse.
    Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make our
trade policy stronger without violating our international trade
agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not
done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't
avoided violating agreements."
    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade
subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports
from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would
hurt the U.S. economy.
    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois
Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if
the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.
    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a
tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this
year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he
saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.
    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still
did not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feel
very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
    The first battle will take place next week when the full
House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such
as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses
with the United States.
    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
but would not automatically set off retaliation.
    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free
trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.
    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would
sign would not be worth passage in Congress.
    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a
statement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
by the president."
    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold
off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect
the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan
vetoed a similar measure last year.
    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the
most influential proponents of aid for specific industries
beset by low priced foreign competition.
    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the
domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate
plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports
reach half of domestic consumption.
    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.
enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration
to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as
dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost
of production.
    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an
industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its
existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the
U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car
imports in 1981.

<TITLE>ENDOTRONICS &lt;ENDO> EXPECTS LOSS FOR YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Endotronics Inc said it expects to
incur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March
31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.
    As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics
cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, &lt;Yamaha
Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.
    In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts
receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another
Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.
    Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations
it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit
facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of
the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit
from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp
&lt;CZ>.
    The company said its ability to obtain funding was
adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its
shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against
three officers of Endotronics.
    Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges
violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.
    The company also said the Securities Division of the
Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into
the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by
insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.
    It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will
hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.
    As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory
note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the
various investigations concerning insider trading, the company
said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in
instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by
increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the
United States.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Air Corp said under a settlement
of class action litigation with &lt;Mutual Shares Corp>, former
minority shareholders of Continental Airlines Inc will receive
an additional 3.75 dlrs per share.
    In February, Texas Air acquired the minority interest in
Continental that it did not already own for 16.50 dlrs per
share. Mutual had challenged the adequacy of the price.
    Texas Air said any former Continental holder who has sought
appraisal rights under Delaware law may continue to seek the
appraisal remedy in Delaware Chancery Court or accept the
settlement and drop the appraisal process.
    Texas Air said the settlement has other terms relating to
employee shareholdrs of Continental, who will receive options
from Texas Air.  It did not give details.
    The company said the settlement is subject to approval by
the Delaware Chancery Court, which is expected to take about 60
days.

<TITLE>COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Representatives of cocoa consuming
countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer
stock rules, delegates said.
    While consumers do not yet have a common position, an
observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more
fluid ... and the tone is positive."
    European Community consumers were split on the question of
how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met
in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into
effect, delegates said.
    At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how
the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting
ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.
    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether
the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their
differences at this month's meeting.
    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an
informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among
producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.
    The key issues to be addressed at this council session
which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should
be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price
differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types
of cocoa, delegates said.
    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be
able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.
    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and
consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke
up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a
consumer meeting.
    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a
variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being
accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group
meeting this afternoon.
    "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer
delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be
difficult to negotiate."
    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non-
members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an
increasingly important producer.

<TITLE>SWISS OPTIONS, FUTURES EXCHANGE PLANNED FOR 1988</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Preparations for the launch of a Swiss
options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely
electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,
according to members of the project team.
    The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)
is a new departure in that it will introduce an additional
range of financial instruments and electronic trading methods
to the traditionally conservative Swiss market.
    There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading
and clearing systems will be completely automated.
    The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,
follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle
and Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of
keen competition from London and Frankfurt.
    These innovations included the introduction last October of
continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single
continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to
supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at
the close of business, and experiments in electronic trade.
    Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching
covered warrants on shares of other Swiss companies.
    "If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its
international prominence in portfolio management, our bankers
and fund managers must have the same modern instruments at
their disposal as their competitors," says Soffex president
Rudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The computer terminals on which business will be conducted
will be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many
Swiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.
    Formal applications are not due until next month but a
preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this
week showed strong interest in membership.
    "The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all
over the country has been very encouraging," says Philippe
Bollag of the project team.
    Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius
Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost
foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse
turnover generally.
    The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should
attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.
    Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss
banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.
    Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to
15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new
Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading
in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified
future date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.
    Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating
in the market through computer terminals in their own offices.
Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.
    Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage
firms with an office in Switzerland, while clearing members
must be recognised as banks under Swiss law.
    The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp
software and hardware, provides display of best bid and offer
prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous
negotiation of block orders and maintains member order books.
    An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants to
gauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a
particular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic
clearing functions will be carried out overnight.
    Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the
100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures
markets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
    This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost
thousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffmann-La Roche und
Co AG, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quoted
this week at 209,000 francs each.
    Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months
following the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,
July or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in
future if market liquidity permits.
    Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas
such as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory
and regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.
    Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were
enthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their
own involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.
    "We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will
require a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at a
major Swiss bank. "We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all
day at a screen where nobody shouts at you."
    Moving into traded options will also require considerable
investment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely
new dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and
some banks are already sending staff abroad for training.

    After January's rise the government was forced to revise
its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an
initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January
rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February

restate its results for 1986 to a loss of about one mln dlrs
due to a reclassification of loans recommended by auditor Ernst
and Whinney.
    The company said the restatement also reflects a
substantial increase in reserves of its principal subsidiary,
Capitol Bank and Trust Co.
    It said it expects to earn 2,250,000 to 2,750,000 dlrs for
the first quarter of 1987.
    Capitol said to maintain an adequate capital ratio it will
seek additional equity capital in the near future.
    It also said it has delayed its annual meeting until May
due to the restatement of annual earnings.
    Capitol said its board raised the quarterly dividend to 23
cts from 22 cts a share, payable April 28, record MArch 31.
    The company originally reported 1986 earnings of 7,700,000
dlrs.  It earned 3,848,000 dlrs in last year's first quarter.
    The annual meeting had been scheduled for the second week
of April.

<TITLE>U.S. SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>American soybean producers are
confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable
oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to
chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect
Wayne Bennett said.
    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer
delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at
a lunch.
    After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this
morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would
vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.
    "Our information suggests we will have the required number
of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"
he said.
    "The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20
years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it
once and for all," Bennett added.
    Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.
Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate
with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he
said.
    The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight
the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
    U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for
one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion
dlrs a year, Bennett said.
    The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers
badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of
soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other
higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax,
he added.
    The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to
finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.
    "We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat
the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and
watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC
measures," Bennett said.
    "The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist,
and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"
he added.

<TITLE>SWEDISH UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AS DATA IS REVISED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A new method of calculating Sweden's
unemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth,
a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said,
reporting a substantial drop in the past year.
    According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless in
February representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000
or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.
    SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based
on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought
Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the
Geneva-based International Labour Organisation.
    Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed
by about 16 pct. "The way we are now collecting data is far more
accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out
whether the jobless want work, whether they are able to work
and whether they have actually looked for work," he told
Reuters.
    The new method was first used for the January figures,
which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce
from 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the
change had apparently not been noticed by the press.
    Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment in
February 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Monetary System marks its
eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
transferred from national governments and central banks to an
autonomous European Monetary Fund.
    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is
that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one
economist who has closely watched the system's development.
    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.
    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
currency, outside the system.
    No change in the British government's attitude is expected
before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
about the chances for any fundamental change.
    "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo
de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
predict.

<TITLE>IRAN PROBERS AGREE ON IMMUNITY FOR POINDEXTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional investigators of the
Iran-contra scandal have tentatively agreed to grant immunity
from prosecution to a star witness --President Reagan's former
national security adviser John Poindexter, congressional
sources said today.
    Sources told Reuters the chief counsels of the two special
committees probing the two-year episode that has darkened the
White House image plan to take their preliminary accord to
court-appointed special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, possibly
today or tomorrow.
    The tentative accord follows weeks of negotiating with
Walsh and with committee members.
   Poindexter would be the highest ranking official to be
granted immunity in the investigations of the 1985-1986 arms
sales to Iran to gain release of hostages held in Lebanon and
the clandestine shifting of arms profits to arm U.S.-backed
rebels in Nicaragua, at a time aid would have been illegal.
    If the agreement --reached on Friday by Arthur Liman and
John Nields, chief legal advisors of the Senate and House
committees respectively --is ratified as expected by Walsh and
the full committees, closed door interviews could be held with
Poindexter in two months with public testimony in about 90 days
or mid June, sources said.
    "They have tentatively reached an agreement and are supposed
to meet with Walsh or his deputies," a source told Reuters of
the deliberations by the two chief counsels
    Sources said Poindexter could assist investigators
determine what Reagan knew about the diversion of funds from
arms sales to Iran to rebels in Nicaragua, if anything.
    Reagan has denied knowing about the shift of funds although
he has admitted he gave orders to sell arms through Israel in
either August or after the first shipment in September 1985,
but can't remember when. Congress was kept in the dark about
the affair until last autumn.
    "He will be a credible witness," one source said of the
pipe-smoking Poindexter. 
    Besides Reagan's knowledge, or lack of it, another key
unanswered questions lingering from earlier congressional
investigators and a special presidential review board, is who
received  millions of dollars from clandestine arms profits.  
    So far the money trail uncovered by probers stops at secret
Swiss and Cayman Islands bank accounts.
    The committees have been privately negotiating with Walsh
over the immunity matter, and the prosecutor, also called an
independent counsel, has been urging the committees to hold off
on their request for at least 90 days.
    Under the tentative accord, the wishes of Walsh could be
met since public testimony is not expected before 90 days.
    Poindexter, a Navy vice admiral, along with his fired
deputy at the National Security Council, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, have refused to testify before investigators,
claiming their fifth amendment rights against self
incrimination.
    Yesterday, Vice President George Bush said in a a
television interview that he disagreed with Maureen about court
martials, but he too disclaimed any details of diverted funds.
    So far, granting immunity to compel testimony from
reluctant witnesses has been granted to five persons--with the
key figure so far, shadowy California international arms
merchant Albert Hakim.
    Also, getting immunity has been North's attractive personal
secretary, Fawn Hall, who was said to have assisted North in
shredding documents in his White House basement office after
the scandal broke.

<TITLE>SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange
controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with
European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the
ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.
    "The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift
restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with
deregulation in the banking industry," he said in a telephone
interview.
    The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls
highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.
    The central bank said in a statement the measures included
increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision
for future pension fund obligations.
    It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate
Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the
Community last year.
    Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a
process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign
banks to open branches.
    Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and
they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets.
    Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign
currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a
previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.
    The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that
date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the
country on new foreign currency loans.
    The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion
pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be
given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.
    Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign
currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by
issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.
    They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign
issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.
    Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,
instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.
    The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the
amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited
to three times a bank's capital equity.
    The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most
bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which
imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta
funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.
    The reserve requirement, which was already in place on
normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign
speculative capital which is entering the country and
threatening the government's money supply growth target.
    A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now
account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a
disadvantage with European competitors.
    The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements
to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of
interest rate deregulation. "The real problem is the freeing of
interest rates," the banker said. "This is going to take a big
bite out of profits."
    The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid
on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the
measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this
year.

<TITLE>AMSTERDAM LAUNCHES 300 MLN GUILDER CP PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The city of Amsterdam launched a 300
mln guilder commercial paper program in the Dutch market, lead
manager Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV said.
    The issue has denominations of one mln guilders and
maturities ranging from two weeks to one year. Clearing and
delivery is through the facilities of the Dutch central bank.
    Amsterdam is the third Dutch municipality to use a
commercial paper program as credit facility. The Hague and
Rotterdam preceded with programs arranged by Algemene Bank
Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>. Details of the first tranche of the
program are still unknown.
    "At the moment, commercial paper is a cheaper form of credit
than the traditional "kasgeldleningen'," said Amsterdam's
financial alderman Walter Etty after signing the contract.
Current regulations allowed the city to acquire only half of
its short term borrowing requirement with CPs, he added.
    Kasgeldleningen or short term advances are a widely used
instrument in the Dutch market which has faced competition from
CPs since the Finance Ministry approved them in January 1986.
    "CPs and CDs are currently slightly cheaper than traditional
credit lines for promotional reasons," Amro board member Dick
Meys told journalists at the signing ceremony.
    Despite the lower cost to borrowers, the Dutch market for
commercial paper and certificates of deposits is growing only
slowly in the face of the well-developed kasgeld market and
institutional investors have hardly discovered this instrument,
Meys said.
    Foreign interest in guilder CPs and CDs is almost
non-existent due to the strong position of the guilder, but
Amro's London-based subsidiary EBC Amro Bank Ltd joined the
syndicate in case such interest emerges, Meys said.

downgraded to AA from AA-plus the Kingdom of Denmark's
long-term external debt.
    The action affects the equivalent of 17.6 billion U.S. dlrs
of debt.
    S and P cited Denmark's weakened external competitiveness,
saying it contributed to a steady deterioration of the
country's current account balance and a substantial rise in its
external debt burden.
    Net foreign debt increased to 129 pct of total exports in
1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P pointed out.
    Standard and Poor's said that while it expects lower
imports and current account imbalances this year, rising labor
costs should further weaken Denmark's competitiveness.
    However, S and P said its downgrade did not affect the
A-1-plus short-term debt rating of Denmark or its wholly owned
Danish Oil and Natural Gas.
    Similarly, the AA ratings on the long-term debt obligations
of Copenhagen County Authority and I/S Elsam were affirmed.

Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, believes that it would be
necessary to raise "at least" 18 billion dlrs in higher
revenues--the same being proposed by House Budget Committee
Chairman William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
    The Senate committee will hold its first drafting session
on a budget tomorrow, the House group later in the week.
    Both sides want to meet a congressional target of April 15
for congressional approval of a new budget. However, the
Congressional Budget Office said that a deficit cut of 36
billion dlrs will fail to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law
goal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billion
dlrs short. 
    President Reagan's budget, not accepted by either
committee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficit
reductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenues
through asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimated
deficit base of 144 billion dlrs.
    Reagan said his budget hits the Gramm-Rudman goal for 1988
but the Congressional Budget Office said it is way off the mark
with over optimistic economic assumptions.
    Currently, there are discussions underway by House and
Senate committees to redefine the fixed Gramm-Rudman targets
for more realistic levels that can be reached, which would push
off by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget,
sources said.

<TITLE>GERMAN BOURSE TURNOVER TAX DECISION ANGERS BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of the West German government
to abolish a tax on bourse turnover when other taxes came under
discussion during recent coalition negotiations was a "bitter
disappointment," the president of the West German Federation of
Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, said.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference that, contrary
to numerous assurances from the government, the abolition of
the turnover tax had not been touched upon.
    "This must not be allowed to be the last word. Otherwise a
major chance for West Germany as a financial centre will have
been missed," he said.
    After the January 25 election the government decided upon a
reform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cuts
of 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.
    In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetary
conference in Paris, the government said earlier this month
part of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.
    Government sources have said the fact the latest coalition
discussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does not
necessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolished
later in the current four-year legislative period.
    The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades where
an end-investor is involved, generated government revenue of
some 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons for
maintaining the tax because companies would benefit from its
abolition. Their earnings would increase and the government
would receive more in profits tax.
    Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said
the bourse tax decision did not fit into the general background
of liberalisation of the German capital market, and represented
a weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.

    Cosma is expected to have 1987 sales of more than 400 mln

<DATELINE>    Chicago, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of the United Food and
Commercial Workers union, UFCW, local 222 voted Sunday to go on
strike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska,
plant, effective Tuesday.
    The company submitted their latest offer to the union at
the same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of
tomorrow that started December 14.
    Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that
was submitted to the union late last week. An overwhelming
majority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the
meeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman Allen
Zack said.
    Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was
unacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good
faith.
    IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour
for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for
processing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay
workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted
since then, Zack said.
    The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours
following the normal 40 hour work week, he added.

<TITLE>BELGIUM REVISES DOWN 1987 GNP GROWTH FORECASTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian government has lowered its
forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in
1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.
    He said this revision, which brings government forecasts
more closely into line with those by private institutions,
takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy
and international trade.
    But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be
limited due to recent agreements on wages and working
conditions agreed by employers and unions.
    Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to
grow in volume terms.
    However, last month the government's Planning Bureau said
it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0
pct.
    In 1986, Belgium's gross national product rose 2.15 pct in
volume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise.

<TITLE>BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>External risks for the economy have
increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still
possible, according to President of the West German Federation
of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further
fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the
revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West
German exporters were facing a "rough wind."
    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private
consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.
He saw good prospects for consumer industries.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to
concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this
context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase
the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.
    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled
for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this
month, was an "important step in the right direction."
    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from
56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut
the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was
"rather half-hearted."

it expects to incur a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1987
equal to or greater than its loss of 240,697 dlrs for the
fourth quarter ended December 31, 1986.
    Cambridge said it expects revenues for the first quarter to
be approximately the same as those recorded for the fourth
quarter ended December 31, 1986, of 1,025,961 dlrs.
    Cambridge recorded a profit of 2,204 dlrs on revenues of
847,000 dlrs for the first quarter of fiscal 1986, the company
said.
    The company attributed the expected loss to lower than
expected sales from its laboratory and consulting business and
planned major investment in its proprietary treatment
technology.
    The company said winter is traditionally its slowest
season.

<TITLE>MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Based speciality food retailer &lt;Mrs
Fields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1
mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans further
growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S.
    The company, which is quoted on London's Unlisted
Securities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand its
outlets internationally.
    However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the
company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but
would intensify its efforts where it already had stores.
    During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76
in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and
the U.K.
    "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London
for example and it is reasonable that we might open other
stores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said.
    He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a
matter of routine, and might add others in 1987, but declined
to say how much the company planned to spend on them.
    Last year turnover rose by 20.8 pct to 87.1 mln dlrs from
72.6 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRAZIL SAYS DEBT CRISIS IS WORLD PROBLEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister
Dilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only
be solved by changes in the international financial system.
    Speaking to a business conference he said "It is not Brazil
that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International
Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community
that is taking away resources from the developing countries."
    "The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the
third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had
remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only
two billion in fresh funds," he added.
    Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe
and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend
interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he
stressed the country's commitment to growth.
    "We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt
problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop
growing," he said, adding that political and not purely
commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.
    Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest
in the developing world, has been under pressure from official
and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment
program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign
payments problems.
    President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused
to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead
to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he
had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of
finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.
    "We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be
one of continuous crisis."
    To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more
machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw
materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this
year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5
billion.
    Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction
in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic
product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should
fall to 1.5 pct this year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 0/92 program would have very
little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
to a report from the Agriculture Department.
    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
small," the report said.
    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
acreage," the USDA report said.
    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
participation," Collins said.
    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
cotton, the report said.
    "In determining whether to participate, a producer would
need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
considered," according to the analysis.
    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.
    For producers with low production costs, that difference is
greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
attractive.
    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
production decisions from government payments," Collins said.
    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
be over by the end of this month.

<TITLE>IFC PLANS TO LEAD THIRD WORLD TO CAPITAL MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Finance Corporation
is planning to intervene to help certain developing country
companies to borrow on world capital markets, IFC chief
executive Sir William Ryrie told a news conference.
    Ryrie said the IFC is at present seeking to overcome
regulatory barriers to its underwriting business on the United
States and London markets.
    "There are many companies in the more advanced developing
countries which are strong enough to borrow by issuing bonds or
floating rate notes," he added.
    However, such companies needed help and the IFC could play
a role by introducing them into the market and underwriting
issues, Ryrie said.
    "The capital markets would then get used to the idea of
buying the paper of these companies," he added. "There is a
potential source of development finance there which could be
very large."
    He said he was confident there were enough institutional
investors who would be interested in taking paper in the
interests of portfolio diversification.
    The IFC, whose role is to provide international financing
for private sector investments in developing nations, generally
does this by providing pump priming finance to persuade western
companies to invest in third world enterprises.
    However, in recent years it has set up three investment
funds through which institutional investors can hold shares in
developing country stock exchanges.
    It announced the third such fund, one of 30 mln dlrs for
investment on the Thai stock exchange, in December. There is a
120 mln dlr South Korea fund and one of 50 mln dlrs which
invests in a number of developing country stock exchanges.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gilles Trequesser, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Private coffee exporters say Colombia's
more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the
country does not suffer excessively from current depressed
prices and erratic market conditions.
    Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association,
said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest
producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of
International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.
    "Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most
from this situation," he said.
    Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over
re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986,
and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.
    Arango said that government measures adopted here last
week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a
major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.
    "This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world
market conditions are also new," he said.
    The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said
the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed
more often in order to closely reflect market trends.
    Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was
the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an
unlimited amount.
    But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy
selling of coffee.
    "Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but
consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react
to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of
giving its coffee away."
    Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming
exports, he said.
    "We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but
neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full
well what Colombia's export potential is," he said.
    Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,
exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year
which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.
    Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions
but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not
exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the
National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous."
    He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the
number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was
likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and
oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.
    On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said
Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed
to force a compromise.
    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head
of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the
intransigence of some big countries, without naming them.
    However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar
Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States
would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming
weeks to revise its policy.
    "Washington will have to take into account that for many
countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central
America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have
far-reaching political and economic consequences."
    Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export
quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which
could emerge from continuous contacts.

<TITLE>BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987
government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.
    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to
419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of
417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.
    Martens said following a lowering of government estimates
of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government
departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that
unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the
target by 22.5 billion francs.
    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts
by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.
The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through
treasury operations.
    Martens said the money is being found through a series of
small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of
two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's
50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.
    Last year, the government announced a major program
designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.
    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the
government said was a "snowball effect" under which the
government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits
which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying
existing debt.
    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated
at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.

<TITLE>ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Cooney, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique
among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global
expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.
    First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is
attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because
... they're going to have to build an international earnings
base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
trust companies," Walsh said.
    Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's
154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth
this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.
    Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with
assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated
internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.
    Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when
other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and
loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.
    The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,
Cornelissen said.
    Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset
management, merchant and private banking companies.
    "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the
Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would
otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."
    Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
competition with major global financial institutions in
activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,
in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional
trust activities such as asset management, private banking and
advisory services.
    He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
"before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory
Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.
    "The international market is so big and we have such a
miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we
don't think the international markets are well-served."
    Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign 
investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
investment abroad, Cornelissen said.
    Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid
economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said
Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion
dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.
    Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia
will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of
global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had
to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include
offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also
recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
    The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any
acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our
eyes wide open for the right opportunities."
    Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the
company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,
Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
covered by hundreds of small regional banks.
    "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"
said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will
probably do something with in the next five years."
    He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services
analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.
    Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,
trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in
one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition
for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.

<TITLE>SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR &lt;CAT> OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised
its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy
from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.
    Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
    "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
1988 and 1989," he said.
    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
improved demand.
    The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
increased value of the yen, he said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Governor of the Bank of England,
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, repeated his criticism of City
predators, describing them as "thoroughly irresponsible."
    "I have been concerned when predators have sought to use a
minority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managed
company and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomes
daily expected," he said in a speech to the Industrial Society.
    "Such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsible
exercise of shareholder power, and an abuse of the arrangements
we have for the protection of shareholders' interests," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a
speech last week, when he attacked the practice of "putting a
company into play."
    This is when predators use a minority shareholding to force
a company's management into action which will raise the
company's share price. The predator then withdraws, taking
substantial profits.
    In today's speech, Leigh-Pemberton said it was hard to find
the right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherence
to a free market philosophy.

<TITLE>CONSUL RESTAURANT &lt;CNSL> IN EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consul Restaurant Corp said it began
an exchange offer for its 13 pct convertible debentures due
1992 with an aggregate principal amount of 17.5 mln dlrs.
    Consul officials told an analysts meeting that in return
for each 1,000 dlr face value of the bonds tendered, investors
will receive 10 shares of preferred stock convertible after Dec
1, 1987, into 500 shares of common. The company said the value
represents a substantial premium over the debentures' market
value, which traded at 410 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face amount on
March 13.
    Consul said the debt was taken on to finance expansion.
    James Crivits, Consul chairman, said debt service on the
outstanding debentures has cost the company 55 cts a share per
quarter and cut deeply into the company's profitability.
    For the year ended May 31, 1986, the company reported a net
loss of 1.12 dlr per share or 5.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 77.6
mln dlrs.
    Crivits said the company will report an improved but still
unprofitable third quarter ended February 28, compared to a
loss of 22 cts a share in the year-ago thrid quarter. He said
current third quarter results would be similar to 1987's
second quarter's loss of 12 cts per share.
    Crivits said the company will not produce a gain in the
fourth quarter or the full year, and said there will be a write
off in the fourth quarter for the debenture exchange offer. He
would not specify the amount of the write off.
    Robert Lamp, Consul's chief financial officer, said the
company needs to have at least 90 pct of the bonds exchanged in
the transaction to report a profit in the first quarter of
fiscal 1988. Lamp said that if the exchange is successful, the
company will report profits much higher than the three cents a
share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1987.
    The Minneapolis-based company, which it said is the
nation's largest franchisee of Chi-Chi's family-style Mexican
restaurants, said it had the planned to expand to 80 units, but
had to abandon the effort, leaving 38 units in operation.
    The company also said the restaurants are profitable, with
profit margins increasing over last year.

subsidiary said it plans to raise about 500 mln dlrs in U.S.
capital markets in three to four months.
    Company officials, at a press conference, said the money
would be raised through the sale of debentures, adding these
securities are expected to be registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission following Standard and Poor's Corp's
rating of the company's debt next week.
    Officials said most of the funds raised will be used to pay
down 600 mln dlrs of bridge loans taken out last month when
American Hoechst bought Celanese for 2.8 billion dlrs.
    The officals said Hoechst Celenese's 1987 capital spending
of over 200 mln dlrs will be funded from internally generated
cash. They pointed out this is little changed from the combined
spending of American Hoechst and Celanese Corp in 1986.

<TITLE>U.S. CAPACITY USE RATE 79.8 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. factories, mines and utilities
operated at 79.8 pct of capacity in February, compared with a
revised 79.6 pct in January and December, the Federal reserve
Board said.
    The Fed previously said the rate was 79.7 pct in January
and 79.5 pct in December.
    A surge in automobile assemblies in February and a gain in
primary metals production helped raise manufacturing to 80.1
pct capacity from 79.9 pct in January.
    Durables manufacturing increased to 76.8 pct last month
from 76.3 pct in January, the Fed said.
    Nondurable manufacturing eased to 85.2 pct of capacity use
from 85.4 pct in January.
    Last month's rate was down from 80.2 pct in February, 1986.
    Fabricated metals increased to 81.4 pct in February from
81.2 pct in January, while motor vehicles and parts jumped to
83.6 pct from 80.0 in January.
    Primary metals rose to 67.7 pct from 66.7 pct in January.
    Petroleum products fell to 92.5 pct in February from 94.5
pct in January.
    Capacity utilization for mining rose to 75.3 pct in
February from 75.1 pct in January, but was below the February
1986 rate of 79.4 pct, the Fed said.
    The use rate for utilities was up to 80.8 pct last month
from 80.4 pct in January.
    Producers of industrial materials operated at 78.9 pct of
capacity, the same as in January and December, but down from
the February 1986 rate of 79.6 pct.
    The Fed said the decline in energy materials use and
durables goods materials were the reason for the decline over
the past year for producers of industrial materials.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FDA PANEL BACKS UPJOHN &lt;UPJ> BALDNESS DRUG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The federal Food and Drug
Administration's Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted
unanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe and
effective.
    The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine for
marketing in the United States, so long as accompanying
packaging and promotional materials disclose that the product
has only limited effect on male pattern baldness.
    The five outside experts attending today's FDA committee
meeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after an
outside consultant told them the drug "appears to be quite safe
in the normal male population."
    The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of Medicine
Carl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based on
a study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug in
Canada, where it was approved for marketing last year.
    "The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of side
effects," Leier said.
    The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in the
drug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effects
while taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changes
in heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.
    Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already been
approved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressure
drug.
    But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a male
baldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquid
form.
    Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to the
scalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstream
to affect the heart.
    But panel members concluded that the amount absorbed
merited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.
    Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official Richard
De Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials produced
moderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40
pct after 12 months.
    He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make the
new hair fall out.
    "The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placebo
effect," panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University of
Texas told the meeting.
    He said patients administered a placebo during clinical
trials typically had about half as much new hair growth as did
individuals treated with Rogaine.
    As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months before
they can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, he
said.
    In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs
(U.S.).
    An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drug
in the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.
    During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre side
effect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexual
dysfunction known as "exagerrated erection."
    Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted a
safety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, said
researchers had found a number of cases of patients who had
exagerrated erections as a result of the drug.
    He said this was a common effect for drugs of the same
class as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.
    FDA officials said they could make no prediction on when
Rogaine might be approved for marketing.
    Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Boston
dermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated the
effect of the drug.
    He said "about one in five will have a substantial clinical
effect," which he defined as a significant growth of new hair
that made the patient actually look better.
    He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost of
Rogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fund
resources.
    "I would hope that insurance companies will take a strong
line that this is not a product we will reimburse for," Stern
told reporters.
    "I think this is a drug that has some application for some
people, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,"
he said.
    But he said individuals should be required to pay for the
treatment out of their personal funds.
    Stern estimated more than 100,000 American men are already
using minoxidil on their scalps, outside the law, by grinding
up the blood pressure pill and dissolving in a solvent.

<TITLE>TORONTO SUN EXAMINING POSSIBLE U.K. TABLOID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Toronto Sun Publishing Corp> said it
was examining an idea for a new tabloid newspaper in Britain
after being being approached about the concept by a person in
England it declined to indentify.
    "We were talking to this individual and offered to help him
in effect formulate his concept and that is about as far as it
has gone," Toronto Sun Publishing vice-president of finance
Bruce Jackson said in reply to a query.
    "We have not decided anything," Jackson added. "It has not
been brought to the board of directors for any kind of approval
or heavy discussion."
    Jackson said that Toronto Sun recently produced a dummy
newspaper for the individual to use in testing possible British
market reaction. Toronto Sun publishes tabloids in Toronto,
Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta and the Houston Post.
    Asked about possible financial or editorial support by
Toronto Sun, Jackson replied: "It is far too premature to
discuss anything like that." He said further developments were
unlikely to unfold for "at least a month."
    Jackson described the British tabloid market as "very
competitive, but it is a very large market as well. It most
likely doesn't take a large market share to be profitable there
as long as you find the right niche."
    He said Toronto Sun is approached almost every month about
ideas for starting newspapers, mostly in North America, "as the
Toronto Sun is known to be a newspaper group that has started
papers.
    "Unfortunately, this one leaked out and it probably
attracted a little more attention than it really deserves at
this point," Jackson said.
    Toronto Sun recently dropped plans to start a second
English language newspaper in Montreal, citing a study that
indicated the lack of a sufficient advertising base for such a
paper.

<DATELINE>    GOLDEN, Colo., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Worldgroup Cos Inc said it was
sued by two companies operating three franchised travel
agencies for violating franchise and trademark agreements.
    The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the western
district of Missouri, seeks 385,000 dlrs for losses and almost
9.2 mln dlrs in additional damages.
    The suit alleges the sale of the franchises by IT Financial
Corp of Tulsa to International Tours Inc, a Worldgroup unit,
violated franchise, trademark and other agreements. It also
claims the defendants have conspired to restrain trade and
violated federal racketeering laws, the company said.
    Worldgroup said the claims are unfounded and that it plans
to defend itself vigorously.
    In addition to Worldgroup and IT Financial, K mart Corp
&lt;KM> was named as a defendant, Worldgroup said. Worldgroup has
agreements with K mart to market travel services.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said the United States will retaliate if the European
Community adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils, but he did
not say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal.
    Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA)
convention here, Yeutter said he is "cautiously optimistic" the
controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC
Council of Ministers.
    Yeutter said the proposed tax is a "flagrant violation of
the spirit of GATT" because it would imperil the zero binding
duty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe.
    He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on a
retaliation list. The administration would not reveal a
retaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CANADA'S MULRONEY SAYS U.S. TRADE DEAL NEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
"significant progress" was being made in trade talks with the
United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging.
    Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons,
Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in
Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.
    Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, said
that while the negotiations were risky and difficult, "a
profile of a major trade deal is now emerging."
  In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionate
defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas
of the country a major economic boost.
    "Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades,
we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that is
rich and promising, one that is under-developed and
under-employed," said Mulroney.
    "What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British
Columbians and Albertans and others, that they get their
chance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their way
to prosperity."
    Few detials have been released on the trade talks which
were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that
are each others most important trading partners.
    Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade
sources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal
and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many
non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
    It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is
a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,
something that would give Canada protection from Washington's
tough trade remedy laws.
    But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment
in the U.S, said Canada was a "fair trader" and denied the
government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the
American market.
    He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.
    "We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is
fair to both sides," Mulroney said.

<TITLE>NCR &lt;NCR> SEES GOOD CHANCE FOR RECORD YEAR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>NCR Corp is very optimistic that it will
post record revenues and profits for 1987, Charles E. Exley Jr,
chairman and president, said.
    "Much of our considerable optimism about the future is
based on the strength of a continuing flow of new products,"
Exley told a meeting of securities analysts. "Our current
position is the strongest in modern NCR history with
new-generation offerings deliverable in every major category
this year."
    For 1986, NCR's earnings rose nine pct, to 3.42 dlrs a
share, on sales that increased 13 pct, to 4.9 billion dlrs.
    During the balance of 1987, Exley said NCR will pay close
attention to increasing its penetration of major accounts,
expanding its third-party distribution channels and continuing
its introduction of new products.
    "In 1986, new products introduced within the proceding 36
months accounted for more than 65 pct of our major equipment
order activity," he said.
    "At the end of two months," he added," I can say we are off
to a good start" for 1987.

<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Desjardins Group>, the Quebec credit
union organization with 30 billion dlrs in assets, needs a new
structure to raise capital and compete outside of Quebec and is
considering a share issue, president Claude Beland said.
    Beland said the group is considering forming a holding
company which would raise capital by issuing preferred,
non-voting shares.
    "If we want to expand we have to look into other markets,"
Beland said in an interview. "Right now we have many
opportunities but we don't have the tools to react properly,"
he said.
    The co-operative organization, which was founded in 1900,
said it accounts for 38 pct of Quebec consumer loans, 50 pct of
mortgage loans, and 18 pct of commercial loans in the province.
It said it also controls Quebec's largest life insurance
company.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FIAT CONVERTIBLE BOND OPTION UNDER STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sources close to the Italian state credit
institution (Istituto Mobiliare Italiano - IMI) said a
convertible bond issue was one of the possibilities being
studied to facilitate market absorption of Fiat shares sold
last year by Libya and still in the hands of banks.
    The sources could give no further details of the options
under study.
    A Fiat spokesman contacted by Reuters said the company had
no comment to make on the possibility of a convertible bond
issue, saying any decision to be taken "did not depend on Fiat."
    Italian press reports that a bond issue was under study
pushed Fiat's shares higher on the Milan bourse today.
    The company's ordinary shares closed in Milan today at
12,540 lire in Milan today, up from a closing 12,195 Friday.
    Fiat preference shares and savings (non-voting) shares
gained even more strongly, closing at 7,740 and 7,841 lire
respectively against 7,353 and 7,600 Friday.
    Bourse dealers say the fall in value of Fiat stock over the
last six months partly reflects selling by foreign operators of
shares acquired as a result of the 2.1 billion dlr equity offer
after Libya sold its minority stake last September.
    On September 23, 1986, the day Fiat announced it had
reached an agreement under which Libya would sell its 15 pct
stake, Fiat shares closed in Milan at 16,600 lire. Since then,
the trend has been down.
    Last September's share offer, which triggered criticism by
underwriters about the handling of the sale, opened at a
substantial discount to its offer price, resulting in losses
for holders of the shares.
    Some analysts have said the size of offer was too big for
the market to handle efficiently.

<TITLE>AEROSPATIALE STUDYING HIGH-SPEED AIRLINER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-owned Aerospatiale is
working on designs for a hypersonic plane to fly 150 passengers
at five times the speed of sound, and plans to unveil computer
studies at the Paris air show in June, a company spokesman
said.
    The plane, which is similar in concept to the Orient
Express project announced by President Reagan last year, would
have four ram-jet motors, lacking the moving parts of
conventional turbo-jet engines, and each having 30 tonnes of
thrust.
    It would cruise at an altitude of up to 30,000 metres,
around three times higher than conventional aircraft and nearly
twice as high as the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet.
    With a range of 12,000 km it would be capable of flying
from Paris to New York in one hour, compared with three hours
taken by Concorde, and Paris to Tokyo in two hours.
    The aircraft could reach speeds in excess of 5,000 km an
hour.
    The Aerospatiale spokesman said its research scientists had
been working on the project for about two years, drawing on the
experience it gained from Concorde as well as experience in
heat-resistant materials needed on high-speed aircraft which it
has developed from building French nuclear missiles.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FLOATING RATE NOTE MARKET STILL IN TURMOIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dominique Jackson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The market in floating rate notes showed
no clear signs of recovery today from the confusion which sent
prices tumbling and paralysed trading at the end of last week,
dealers and bank officials said.
    FRN dealers said at least 10 houses did not open for
business with many market operators pausing to assess their
next steps in the wake of Friday's huge drops and panic
trading.
    Despite some late signs that prices were recovering last
week, today's erratic trade provided a similarly mixed final
picture with longer-dated FRNs still clearly under pressure.
    While FRN specialists noted that paper on which coupons are
shortly due to be refixed had managed to hold up today, as had
notes paying a relatively higher margin, longer term FRNs were
still subject to intense selling pressure.
    "Anything longer than 10 years is still being sold off
seriously, as is just about any paper in the banking sector,"
one FRN market source at a leading U.S. House said.
    He noted that one long-dated Citicorp issue -- paper which
has suffered recently on fears over Latin American debt
exposure -- slipped by two points to around 94.00. FRNs, whose
coupons are refixed regularly, usually trade around par.
    U.S. And Canadian bank paper was still generally under
pressure, as was Republic of Ireland paper, due to renewed
worries about the Irish economic situation.
    The malaise was felt through the banking sector with a two
point fall registered by one BNP note, to give a three point
drop over two trading days.
    Retail clients, usually seen returning to the market as
price falls push yield margins up to these attractive levels,
have been unnerved by the last three days' panic, dealers said.
    "Yes, there's been some bargain hunting, but no one dares to
be first to come seriously back in," said one dealer.
    "A handful of market giants have frightened the retail away
with this aggressive manipulation. As true liquidity drains, we
are going to have to see some better market cooperation and
rationalisation," commented one FRN trader now dealing with
straight bond issues since the floater market crisis.
    This view was shared by the majority of FRN market sources
polled by Reuters since trade began to collapse last week.
    Of the 50 or so houses who have up until now made a market
in floaters, dealers estimated that around a dozen did not
quote FRN prices today and they reported that one or two houses
were not expected to resume trade in the securities at all.
    Many called meetings to assess the current market
situation.
    "Given the potential volatility of this market -- one which
has been conclusively proved by the events of the last days --
senior management are now duty bound to revise the set of
parameters within which they, as market makers, are now to
work," commented one senior source at a leading U.K. Investment
house.
    However, there were no reports that a formal crisis meeting
of market makers -- such as that called in December last year
during the perpetual FRN market collapse -- was on the cards.
    Several firms were expected to cut back drastically on the
list of FRNs traded, with most volatile paper first to go.
    Elsewhere in the eurobond market, business was extremely
quiet, with virtually no activity seen in the dollar straight
sector which has been becalmed of late, traders said.
    "There has been no real two-way business today, neither has
there been any new issues for diversion," noted one trader.
    "All we have seen today is some squaring up of positions,"
she added. Investors remain cautious of the dollar, which
though recently stable, still has potential downside risk.
    Eurosterling, the market sector which, aside from the FRNs,
has been in the headlines lately, was quiet today ahead of the
U.K. Government budget due to be announced tomorrow.
    Undertone was very firm with dealers expecting a positive
fiscal package tomorrow and, if not more good economic news to
boost sterling, at least confirmation of the bull factors which
have bolstered eurosterling and gilt-edged bonds lately.
    "It was just sit and wait today but I expect it will be full
steam ahead on Wednesday," commented one sterling market source.
    Prices showed gains to 1/8 to 3/8 point across the board.
    Dealers said several new eurosterling issues were currently
in the pipeline and an early issue is expected to be for a
major European bank which currently has a mandate in the
market.
    In other sectors, euroyen also maintained its firm tone.
    Although the market is expected to be resting until trading
switches to an April value date, the euroyen sector is expected
to be buoyed by some professional switching out of Japanese
government bonds into relatively cheaper euroyen bonds.
    Two new yen issues were features on an otherwise quiet
primary market. Both for 15 billion yen due 1992, the first for
Eksportfinans was at five pct and 103 pct, led by Mitsubishi
Finance International. The second for Export Development Corp
at 4-1/2 pct and 101-7/8 pct led by Bank of Tokyo
International.
    The day's only other feature was a targetted 30 mln dlr
stepped coupon deal for Kawasaki Steel due 1994.

<TITLE>EQUITABLE BANC &lt;EBNC> BOSS HAS AMERITRUST STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group controlled by Equitable
Bancorp Chairman Alfred Lerner said it has acquired a 9.6 pct
stake in AmeriTrust Corp &lt;AMTR> and may buy up to 24.9 pct if
obtains regulatory approval.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it bought its stake of 2.0 mln Ameritrust common
shares, for 81.1 mln dlrs as an investment.
    But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Cleveland
partnership, also said it would seek regulatory approval to
increase its stake. Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is the
general partner of Clevebaco L.P.
    The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve
Board on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pct
of the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holding
company.
    If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is
also in Cleveland, said he intends to buy more AmeriTrust
stock, subject to market conditions and other factors.
    Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets
greater than one billion dlrs, he said he is barred by law from
serving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having his
representatives on its board.
    Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrust
management or its policies.
    The group said Clevebaco L.P. bought one mln of its shares
from Bear, Stearns and Co Inc on March 9 at 41 dlrs a share.
    Lerner said he accumulated the other one mln shares through
March 3 and sold them to Clevebaco L.P., which he controls, on
March 10 for 40.10 dlrs a share.

<TITLE>U.S. COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging
Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.
    Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a
duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter
said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the
dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.
    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in
Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a
lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is
an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No
decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after
documents on the ruling are received here later this week.

<TITLE>BALLADUR MAINTAINS 1987 FRENCH INFLATION TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he
was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the
announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in
retail prices for February.
    He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his
target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between
0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct
year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier
target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.
    He said he was happy with "a good result" for February but
stressed a need for continued "vigilance" against inflation.
    A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year
differential between French and lower West German inflation
rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in
February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.
    If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential came
to 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding "The tendency is
therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main
trading partner."

<TITLE>GENERAL CINEMA &lt;GCN> SEES FLAT 1987 NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Cinema Corp said it expects
flat net income for fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31 against 125.8
mln dlrs or 3.43 dlrs a share a year ago.
    The company said the costs of a restructuring at its Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc unit and the previous purchase of an 8.5
pct stake in &lt;Cadbury Schweppes PLC> will lead to the flat net
figure.
    It also said it may raise its stake in Cadbury Schweppes to
25 pct, but has not made any additional stock purchases so far.
    According to the restructuring, Carter Hawley plans to
spin-off its specialty stores, including Neiman-Marcus,
Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, into a new company named
&lt;Neiman-Marcus Group>, whose shares will trade on the New York
Stock Exchange, it said.
    As previously announced, General Cinema will own 60 pct of
the equity and 40 pct of the voting shares in the new company.
The restructuring is subject to approval by Carter Hawley
shareholders.

<TITLE>VW FOREIGN EXCHANGE INQUIRIES FOCUS ON WOLFSBURG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUNSWICK, West Germany, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German state
prosecutors have focussed their inquiries in the suspected
foreign exchange fraud reported by Volkswagen &lt;VOWG.F> on
Wolfsburg, the company's headquarters, the state prosecutor's
office said here.
    Chief state prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters
his office would focus its attention on Wolfsburg, and not
Frankfurt as newspaper reports suggested over the weekend.
    "We asked Frankfurt prosecutors to assist us in our
investigations but their findings led us to believe that we
have to concentrate on Wolfsburg," Retemeyer said.
    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said yesterday the state
prosecutors investigation was now focusing on possible outside
banking accomplices.
    The company's reported loss of 480 mln marks in currency
transactions aimed at hedging against fluctuations in the value
of the U.S. Dollar has produced a shake-up among senior staff.
VW announced over the weekend that Rolf Selowsky, financial
member of the management board, had resigned.
    Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, president of the West
German Federation of Banks, said today that no member bank was
involved in activities which led to the currency loss.

<TITLE>HUGHES' TOOL &lt;HT> U.S. RIG COUNT DECLINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. drilling activity fell last week,
with the number of active rotary rigs dropping by five to 761,
against 1,137 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co said.
    The drilling rig count, which historically falls during the
first quarter of each year, has dropped steadily since early
January when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working. Hughes
economist Ike Kerridge said the U.S. rig count was expected to
fall to a about 700 working rigs by mid-April.
    "I think we're pretty much on track with the expectation
that the seasonal low will come in late March or early April,"
he said. "We're getting close to the bottom."
   Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported gains
in drilling activity last week, with increases of 21 and 13,
respectively. Kerridge attributed the jump in activity to the
likelihood that many of the rigs were omitted from the previous
week's count because they were in transit or being prepared for
work. In the week ended March 9, the rig count for Texas and
Oklahoma fell by 23 and 13, respectively.
    Other states reported slight decreases in drilling activity
last week, Hughes said. Wyoming and Louisiana were down by six,
Kansas and Colorado lost four and Michigan and West Virginia
were down by three rigs.
    Most of the week's decrease came among rigs used for
onshore drilling, which dropped to a total of 669 from last
week's 671. A total of 74 rigs were active offshore and 1 were
working in inland waters during the week, Hughes Tool said.
    In Canada, the rig count was up 1 to 181, against 367 one
year ago.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's parliament has approved an
extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a
key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on
Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.
    The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority
Labour government, gives domestic companies until late
September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and
Namibia.
    "The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an
isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"
Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.
    Government officials said they hope the move will intensify
international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid
policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt
all trade with South Africa by October.
    Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments
to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important
exception for ships whose final destination is decided while
they are at sea.
    Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,
making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final
port at the start of a voyage.
    Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued
oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter
sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.
    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct
of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has
dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,
trade ministry officials said.
    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South
Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight
months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns
from the year-ago figure.
    "Many would say that the law has already had its effect
because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and
Norway," Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.
    "Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring
its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.
    "No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on
international trade with South Africa, but it is an important
political statement by the Norwegian government," he said.
    The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the
ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose
amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.
    Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to
high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it
ferro-alloys and light metals industries.
    Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be

<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Onyx Petroleum Exploration Co
Ltd>, earlier reporting a 1986 net loss against year-ago
profit, said it converted 7,344,000 dlrs of its 11 pct
convertible debentures into 2,824,611 common shares.
    The conversion eliminates its obligation to pay principal
amount due 1993 on the debentures and will increase cash flow
through an interest saving of more than 800,000 dlrs a year,
the company said.
    Onyx earlier reported a 1986 net loss of 10.6 mln dlrs,
after a 10.3 mln dlr writedown on oil and gas property values,
compared to a 1.3 mln dlr profit in the prior year.
    Onyx also said the company is a 37.5 pct partner with
Westcoast Petroleum Ltd in a new oil well drilled in
Otter/Ogston area of central Alberta that tested at rates of
more than 1,000 barrels a day from the Granite Wash formation.
    Well production will be royalty free for five years, with
initial allowable rates expected to be in the range of 150
barrels a day, the company said.

<TITLE>DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said
today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and
Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.
    Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of
Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following
the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.
    "This change is regrettable but there is no reason to
dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's
defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top
AAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement.
    "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing
capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against
expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account
deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and
capability," he added.
    "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series
of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and
encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.
    "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be
ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives
as it has in the past," Simonsen said.
   Standard and Poor's said weaker international
competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a
deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external
debt.
    The external current account deficit rose to a record
preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in
1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,
according to government statistics.
    Government economists forecast that the external current
account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.
    Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports
in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.

<TITLE>TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
full House of Representatives in late April.
    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of
legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement
of trade laws.
    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on
complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products
in the United States at prices below cost of production. It
also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry
complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.
    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
agreements or keep out U.S. products.
    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade
said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes
and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.
    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not
one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"
but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work
toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.
    The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policy
stronger without violating our international trade agreements,"
he said.
    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means
Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade
subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports
from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if
it would hurt the U.S. economy.
    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was
necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign
into law.
    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough
House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he
only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw
Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late
last week that the administration still did not like some of
the bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel very
good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
    The first battle will take place next week when the full
House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.
    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
but would not automatically set off retaliation.
    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign
would not be worth passage in Congress.
    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by
saying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
by the president."
    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill
to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide
said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.
    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most
influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by
low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for
import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his
support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import
tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

<TITLE>ETHIOPIA MINISTER SEES AFRICA DEBT PAYMENT PROBLEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADDIS ABABA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Africa may have to follow Brazil in
halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are
prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy,
Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.
    Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had
caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all
developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting
of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.
    Unless there was an early improvement in developing
countries' terms of trade "the only choice is to follow the
route that Brazil appears to have taken," Tesfay said.
   The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was
called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77
ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing
countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations
with the West.
    Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation
of recent commodity agreements.
    The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to
agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean "several
African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import
essential items," he said.
    Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the
recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
    Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N.
Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was
an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.
    He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and
the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.
    Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign
debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected
to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.
    He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide
more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's
economic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness
to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.
    The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion
dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.
    Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs,
with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji
said the donors had not responded as hoped.
   In view of this poor response, he said "it is possible that
by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few,
will be categorised as least developed countries."
    At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officially
listed in this category.

a five-year defence and economic agreement (DECA) that will
channel hundreds of millions of dollars a year in aid to
Ankara.
    The agreement was signed by Secretary of State George
Shultz and Foreign Minister Vahit Halefoglu after 18 months of
negotiations that won Ankara considerably less than it wanted.
    Under the agreement, the U.S. government pledged it would
use "vigor and determination" to persuade Congress to vote the
money to build up Turkish defenses in return for U.S. air bases
and intelligence-gathering facilities.
    Under today's agreement, which runs until December, 1990,
Turkey will receive nearly 720 mln dlrs in military and
economic aid this year.
    Next year, the U.S. government has promised to ask Congress
for 910 mln dlrs under an agreement that prompted domestic
crticism in Turkey for not winning enough aid.

<TITLE>NEW SENATOR BACKS U.S. FARM DECOUPLING PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Nebraska Republican Senator
David Karnes said he supports proposals to "decouple" farm
subsidies from production decisions.
    Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. in
Omaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the late
Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).
    On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradual
reductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should be
continued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts in
target prices each year are "excessive."
    Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls for
major crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supported
mandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm bill
provision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.
    Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) to
the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention
earlier today and spoke to Reuters after Boschwitz addressed
the NGFA meeting.
    Karnes said he is seeking a seat on the Senate Agriculture
Committee but no decision has been made on the request.
    Karnes, who has not held political office before, was
appointed by Nebraska Republican Governor Kay Orr. He will be
up for election in 1988.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> MAY FACE STRUGGLE OVER DEREGULATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Brough, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co
may have a hard time convincing U.S. regulatory authorities
that lifting controls on its long-distance business will
benefit consumers, industry and congressional analysts say.
    "There's clearly going to have to be an effort (by ATT) to
say that deregulation will not have an adverse effect on the
consumer," said Gerry Salemme, a policy analyst for the House
telecommunications, consumer protection and finance
subcommittee.
    Salemme said that if the Federal Communications Commission
eased restrictions on ATT, Congress probably would consider
taking legislative oversight action to protect consumers'
interests.
    ATT has about 80 pct of the interstate long-distance
market. It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulations
that have control its long-distance phone business.
    ATT spun off its local telephone services operations into
the seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  court
ordered breakup of the telephone giant.
    The regional companies have been prohibited from
manufacturing equipment and from offering information services
and out-of-region long-distance service.
    But some of them want to move into those areas,
particularly the provision of long-distance services, which
would compete directly with ATT.
    ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued in
January that proposed to streamline regulation of certain parts
of its long-distance business.
    The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of the
proposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.
    "That would be foremost in our mind," Hess said.
    Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.
    Congressional aides said they were concerned that if
regulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant market
position to raise consumer rates.
    Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,
its most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, without
full regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will be
passed onto the consumer rather than big business.
    ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.
    The company would become more competitive because it would
not have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing new
services, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.
    However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of
America, which represents more than 200 consumer groups
nationally, said, "When ATT offers new services, they tend to be
geared toward the high volume business market rather than the
average consumer."
    ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,
the FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of
the current 45 days.
    The company also called for a reduction in the amount of
documentation it must file with the FCC each time it introduces
or changes long-distance services.
    "With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace
a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,
targeted approach," said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&amp;T's vice
president of marketing services, in a statement.
    "We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,
the public interest can be protected and all consumers will
benefit," he added.
    MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to ease
restrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.
    Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effort
to halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and its
rivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry. MCI lost
448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.
    The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI because
ATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have to
follow when costs fell in the industry.
    "I'm sort of mystified by those comments," retorted Herman, a
district manager for ATT.
    "ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing on
cost reductions," she added.
    Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,
said he opposed deregulation because it left no alternatives
that would ensure against overcharging by ATT.
    He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduce
prices when the company was benefitting from lower costs from
increased use by consumers of long-distance services.
    Without full regulatory authority this may no longer
happen, he added.

<DATELINE>    AMMAN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jordan is to receive 98.8 mln dlrs in
loans to finance development projects, Planning Minister Taher
Kan'an said.
    Kan'an told reporters the loans, concluded during the past
six months, were made by the European Investment Bank, the
Islamic Development Bank and three Arab funds. He gave no other
details.
    Kan'an said the loans were for Jordan's own nine billion
dlr 1986-1990 development plan and not for the parallel,
controversial 1.3 billion dlr plan for the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and the Gaza strip.
    He said jordan would concentrate on obtaining concessionary
foreign loans and keep commercial borrowings to a minimum.
    Performance in the first year of the national plan was
close to target, the Minister said. The gross domestic product
at factor cost grew 2.4 per cent instead of the planned 2.9 per
cent, he added, but gave no figures.
    Kan'an said public investment was also near the planned
level, but investments by the private sector fell below
expectations. "The private sector still feels inhibited," he
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SEC OKAYS BOESKY FIRMS' MOVE TO PROTECT FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission approved a request by two firms controlled by inside
trader Ivan Boesky that allows them to take steps to protect
hundreds of millions of dollars from potential claimants.
    The SEC granted requests made by Seemala Partners L.P. and
IFB Managing Partnership L.P., to withdraw as registered
brokers, effective March 12.
    With the action, the partnerships are no longer subject to
the SEC's net capital rules requiring them to remain solvent as
brokerage firms. Seemala argued the move would be necessary if
noteholders of Ivan Boesky and Co L.P. are to be repaid.
    In asking the SEC to speed its withdrawal as a registered
broker, Seemala said it wold repay to Boesky and Co, which is
also controlled by the former Wall Street arbitrageur, 660 mln
dlrs in subordinated debt, plus accrued interest.
    IFB Managing Partners, which was also given approval to
withdraw as a broker, has no significant assets, the SEC said.
    Once it is repaid, Boesky and Co will pay 200 mln dlrs in
senior participating notes and 440 mln dlrs in subordinated
participating notes of Hudson Funding Corp to certain
noteholders, Seemala told the SEC.
    Under the planned repayment scheme, Seemala told the SEC
the noteholders would forgo claims of prepayment penalties and
some additional interest amounting to more than 100 mln dlrs.
    The plan would be in the public interest, Seemala argued,
since the noteholders, many of which are savings and loan
institutions and insurance companies, would receive repayment
of the principal on their notes.
    Seemala also argued that the plan would help the limited
partners of Boesky and Co, who were not charged in the Boesky
insider trading scandal, by protecting its remaining equity
from the noteholders' claims.
    Unless the Boesky firms are allowed to complete the
repayment plan, Seemala said Boesky and Co noteholders would
seek total claims of 116.8 mln dlrs, plus 9.2 mln dlrs to 10.6
mln dlrs a month in addition, in addition to other claims.
    Such claims could wipe out Boesky and Co's assets before
other creditors can establish their claims, Seemala said.
    The only opposition to Seemala's Feb 12 request to withdraw
as a broker came from Berger and Montague P.C., counsel for the
plaintiffs in a class action suit against Seemala and other
defendants. The suit involves charges stemming from Boesky's
insider trading in the stock of several major companies.
    Berger and Montague told the SEC it opposes the Seemala
proposal because it would allow Boesky and Co noteholders to
settle their claims ahead of the plaintiffs in the class action
and because Seemala did not disclose the total amount of claims
against it and what percentage defrauded investors would get.
    Seemala has said that its repayment scheme would leave a
pool of about 278 mln dlrs free of claims from Boesky and Co
noteholders which could satisfy other claimants.
    The pool would be in addition to funds placed in escrow
under insider trading settlement agreements, including 11.4 mln
dlrs from Dennis Levine and 50 mln dlrs from Boesky.
    In approving the request, the SEC barred Seemala and Boesky
and Co from making any distributions to its limited partners
for one year and required limited partners who receive
distributions to agree to make themselves liabile up to a point
in any case filed the partnerships.
    The SEC also required Seemala and Boesky and Co to get
confirmation of their assets from a nationally recognized
accounting firm.
    The agency said Boesky and Co and existing and potential
claimants against it have similar interests in eliminating
major creditors and preserving assets for future claims.

<TITLE>ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and
consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a
draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow,
delegates said.
    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what
some delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to the
buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.
    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a
buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they
were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.
    "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --
maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the
session," a consumer delegate said.
    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of
ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various
grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,
delegates said.
    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be
able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for
the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.
    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the
buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing
different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.
    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until
March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most
controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.

<TITLE>SAUDI BUSINESSMEN SEEK TO BOOST PRIVATE SECTOR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABHA, Saudi Arabia, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top Saudi businessmen
discussing ways to bolster the kingdom's private sector at a
Chamber of Commerce conference here today called for finance to
be made available more easily for industrial projects.
    Saleh Kamel, a leading businessman and head of the
Jeddah-based Dallah group, said business needed more funding
and welcomed recent measures to encourage banks to step up
lending.
    But yesterday conference participants were publicly
reprimanded for not investing enough in the kingdom.
    Prince Khaled al-Faisal, governor of the Asir region
hosting the four-day conference, accused businessmen of showing
ingratitude at a time when the government had been prepared to
draw heavily on reserves to maintain spending and stimulate the
economy.
    Businessmen, for their part, argued today that the
kingdom's commercial banks were unwilling to take risks and
help finance industrial projects.
    Saleh Kamel, one of Saudi Arabia's leading businessmen and
head of the Jeddah-based Dallah group, told Reuters the general
economic outlook for trade and industry had improved.
    "We can be optimistic, the economy is looking brighter," he
said. But he also said businessmen needed more finance and
welcomed measures being taken to encourage banks to step up
lending.
    A committee at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the
kingdom's central bank, is now examining the problem.
    Commercial banks are in fact extremely liquid but have
become highly selective in extending new credit after many
companies ran into trouble repaying debt during the last three
years.
    Between 1982 and 1985 banks had to make risk provisions
totalling 4.3 billion riyals and results now coming in for 1986
show another year when heavy reserves had to be made against
bad and doubtful loans.
    The effects of the Middle East economic downturn hit the
construction sector in Saudi Arabia very hard and there has
been a sharp fall in development lending for new industrial
projects.
    The Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source for
private sector finance, made loan commitments totalling 752 mln
riyals in the financial year to September 4, 1986, a decline of
nearly 20 pct on the previous year.
    The government credit agency specialises in low cost loans
for development, funding 50 pct of a project's total value.
    The pattern of the agency's lending has also shown a
distinct shift away from infrastructre-related industry - such
as cement plants - to capital-intensive projects.
    Businessmen said opportunities are now available in service
industries and tourism which is slowly developing in the Gulf
region. But new investment in manufacturing industry shows
fewer signs of taking hold.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acres
of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program
signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops,
Agriculture Department conservation specialists said.
    Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the
non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy
enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big
percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for
a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.
    Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of
the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.
    USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:
    -- wheat  2,615,140 acres
    -- corn   1,894,764 acres
    -- barley   705,888 acres
    -- sorghum  585,552 acres
    -- cotton   417,893 acres
    -- rice       2,035 acres
    -- peanuts      611 acres

    -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres
    -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres
    -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres
    USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state
breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready
for publication later this week, they said.

ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee,
has not decided whether to introduce an administration-backed
bill to apply the so-called 0/92 provision to 1988 through 1990
grain crops, an aide to the senator said.
    The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the
measure, the aide said.
    However, a number of farm groups have told Lugar they
oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985
farm bill, and the senator has decided to take a second look at
the proposal, the aide said.
    Last week the aide indicated Lugar was planning to offer
the 0/92 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation
loophole.

<TITLE>NYSE TO REPORT IMBALANCES ON EXPIRATION FRIDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Stock Exchange said it
will cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission by
disclosing imbalances in market-on-close orders in 50 major
stocks thirty minutes prior to the close of trading Friday.
    The procedure will be followed this Friday when stock index
futures and options and individual stock options expire
simultaneously. Such triple expirations occur four times a year
and in the past have been associated with big swings in stock
market averages. In a new variation of the disclosure rules,
the NYSE said no market-on-close orders related to index
arbitrage can be entered after 1530 EST.
    The NYSE said all market-on-close orders for 50 big
capitalization stocks, including the 30 components of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, must be entered by 1530 EST Friday.
The NYSE will then furnish to financial news services any
imbalance in market-on-close orders of 10,000 shares or more.
    After 1530 EST market-on-close orders in the 50 stocks can
be entered only on the opposite side of the imbalance. But the
bar on entering market-on-close orders related to index
arbitrage after 1530 EST is a new element of the disclosure
plan, which has the goal of making the market less volatile
during the triple expirations.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
raised to Aa-2 from Aa-3 the long-term deposit obligations of
Citizens Fidelity Bank and Trust Co because its parent,
Citizens Fidelity Corp, has merged into PNC Financial Corp.
    Moody's said the merger should strengthen the bank's
earnings potential through the acquired access to PNC's product
lines. It should also result in significantly more financial
flexibility to Citizens Fidelity, Moody's said.
    The bank's Prime-1 rating for short-term deposits was not
affected.

<TITLE>STIFFER U.S. SECURITIES PENALTIES SOUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Committee on Energy and
Commerce is studying recommendations for stricter penalties for
violation of securities laws, said Rep. John D. Dingell, D-
Mich., chairman of the committee.
    Dingell told Reuters after a speech to businessmen here
that insider trading laws must be strengthened to assure that
self-regulation by the securities industry is more effective.
    "We've got to see to it that (exchange) members regulate
their employees," he said.
    Dingell said his committee is "looking at a number of
possibilities" to harshen penalties for violation of securities
laws. But he would not be more specific, saying proposals on
stiffer penalties are still being drafted in Washington.
    "I wish I could be more definitive, but I can't," Dingell
told Reuters.
    Dingell said another solution to the problem of insider
trading would be a "significant" increase in funding for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in SEC's
authority to enforce securities laws.
    Dingell added that he supports self-regulation by the
securities industry rather than government creation of "some
new structure that may or may not work."
    "The markets must regulate themselves," he said.

<TITLE>CME, CBOE TO LAUNCH INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE, announced today
that they will trade futures and options, respectively, on an
index of international securities compiled by Morgan Stanley
Group Inc.
    Morgan Stanley said it has agreed to license the exchanges
to use the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe,
Australia and Far East, or EAFE, stock index as the trading
basis.
    The EAFE index is comprised of 900 international stocks
from 16 nations in Europe, the Far East, and Australia.
    "The EAFE is the only instrument by which world markets are
measured," CME special counsel Leo Melamed said at a news
conference announcing the agreement.
    CME Chairman Jack Sandner noted that one-third of the
exchange's daily trading volume now derives from overseas.
    "The success of our index markets, particularly the S and P
index, is ample precedent to forging ahead" in international
markets, he said.
    Mark Sladkus, publisher of Morgan Stanley Capital
International Perspective, said Japanese bank stocks represent
the largest portion of the index.
    The officials said the exchanges have not yet submitted the
EAFE index to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission for approval.
    However, Melamed said approval is not expected to be
granted quickly, and the exchanges did not set a starting date
for the new contracts.
    The EAFE index is tabulated daily, but Sladkus said
real-time calculation will be introduced when trading begins.
    The conflicting opening and closing of international
securities markets will have to be accommodated in the
calculations, he noted.
    Morgan Stanley has been calculating the EAFE index weekly
since 1970 and daily since 1972.
    The CME and CBOE will negotiate with a third party to be
"an independent monitor ... the guardian" of the index, Melamed
said. "Morgan will remove itself from deciding which stocks
move in and out of the index."

installed a CALM (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring) single-point
mooring terminal off the southwest coast of Oahu at its
Hawaiian Independent Refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs.
    The system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to
the refinery's tank farm and carries refined products to ships
for export, PRI said.
    Company chairman Robert G. Reed said the new mooring system
will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will
reduce ship turnaround time. He said the mooring is the first
of its kind in the U.S.
    The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000
deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said.

<TITLE>U.S. MONEY MANAGERS MAY LEAN TO STOCKS VS BONDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. money managers and investment
advisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperform
bonds, but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half of
portfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts.
    Merrill Lynch said its new asset mix report due today will
urge weightings of 50 pct stock, 35 pct bonds and 15 pct cash
versus 40 pct bonds, 35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously.
    "We believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted because
of the positive momentum of corporate earnings," said Christine
Lisec-Tinto, Merrill senior investment strategist.
    Lisec-Tinto, who formulated Merrill's latest asset mix
recommendations with new chief investment strategist Charles
Clough, said there may be some consolidation of recent stock
price gains, but the market appears to have good potential.
    Through Friday, stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average surged 19.13 pct in 1987. Meanwhile, the 
Shearson Lehman Treasury bond price index edged up 0.4 pct.
    "We believe that the equity market has much more upside
potential than the bond market," Chrysler Corp &lt;C> treasurer
Fred Zuckerman said. He said "interest rates are not coming
down and I would not bet a lot that they will come down
sharply."
    Chrysler's 3.5 billion pension fund last week sold 405 mln
dlrs of corporate bonds in the first of two planned sales of
slightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates.
    Zuckerman told Reuters the proceeds will be used to buy
stock to bring equities to 50 pct or more of the portfolio.
    A roughly even bond/stock portfolio split also is urged by
Wright Investors Service, with 4.25 billion dlrs under
management, but it is more optimistic on bonds than stocks.
    "We'd put half in bonds and half in equities now," said
Judith Corchard, Wright senior vice president. She said the
bond share was lifted from 35 pct in the last three months.
    "The stock market has appreciated sharply and discounted
future corporate earnings extensively," Corchard said. She said
"we're worried about a stock price correction of as much as 10
to 15 pct within six, or possibly even three months."
    Meanwhile, Wright expects bonds to benefit from a half to
one percentage point decline in interest rates by year's end.
    "At this level of the stock market, there is more of an
advantage to being in long-term bonds than in equities, given
our interest rate scenario," Corchard said.
    "The stock market has come a long way in a short time. I'd
be hardpressed to jump into stocks with the Dow near 2300
unless I was really convinced that earnings and multiples will
increase," said a fixed-income securities portfolio manager at
a major money center bank.
    He said the bank has kept bond/equity portfolio mix fairly
stable recently and probably will make no major changes for
months as it awaits economic, oil price and dollar trends.
    "We've seen no real movement from bonds to stocks among our
funds," said George Collins, president of T. Rowe Price
Associates, with 22 billion dlrs in assets under management.
    While he detected no rush into stocks from bonds, either
among the many mutual funds under the T. Rowe Price umbrella or
among outside money managers, Collins thinks stocks are better
investments than bonds at this time.
    "In the near term, the stock market has more prospects for
growth, due to the mixed signals on the economy so far, the
slim chance the Federal Reserve will ease policy and still
heavy debt accumulation," Collins said.
    He expects U.S. stocks to improve further because there is
more corporate earnings potential, nominal interest rates
already are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock.
    Collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks,
the firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting in
equity with the rest in bonds and cash.
    "Our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cash
position in equity portfolios lately," Collins said.
    "Cash" in portfolios usually means short Treasury bills
which can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts.
    Many portfolio managers are working with relatively high
cash positions in equity accounts, often 25 to 30 pct, given  
the belief that there may well be downward price corrections
enroute to higher ground.
    In bond portfolios, the money managers generally showed a
preference for shorter term (10 years and under) Treasury notes
and, to a lesser extent, agency securities, rather than
longer-dated Treasury issues and corporate bonds.
    Since yield premiums of corporate over Treasury bonds are
now the lowest in years, many investors believe corporates are
overvalued versus Treasury and agency issues. Another negative
cited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers,
leveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does not
exist with Treasury or Federal agency securities.
    Farm Credit paper was cited by some as undervalued and a
good buy, despite the issuer's well-publicized financial woes.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has approved an additional 84.0 mln dlrs in credit
guarantees for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria
for fiscal year 1987 under the Export Credit Guarantee Program

    The department said the additional guarantees provide up to
31.0 mln dlrs in coverage for sales of protein meals, 9.0 mln
dlrs for tallow, and 44.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils.
    The latest guarantees increase the cumulative fiscal 1987

464.0 mln dlrs from 380.0, it said.
    To be eligible for the credit guarantees, all sales must be
registered with the CCC by September 30, and shipments
completed by December 31, 1987, it said.

<TITLE>SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> ENDS PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
    The company said the rising political controversy in the
U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
time.
    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
grounds.
    The company said termination of the agreement opened other
possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
    In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
said.
    Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
200 mln dlrs.
    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
about the transaction since it was announced.
    Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
    New, high-technology semiconductors are used in
supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than
existing computers.
    Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by
French interests and headquartered in New York. Fujitsu Ltd is
a computer and telecommunications company based in Japan.

pct to 650 mln dlrs from 614 mln a year earlier.
    However, the company reported net income declined to 17 mln
dlrs, or 77 cts a share, in the quarter ended February 28 from
19 mln dlrs, or 84 cts a year earlier. This year's net included
700,000 dlrs from the sale of assets while last years was
increased 3.0 mln dlrs by such sales.
    GenCorp said lower operating profits for the tire and
plastics and industrial products segments were essentially
offset by higher wallcovering results.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. exporters will have the
opportunity to sell an additional 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
wheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The department said the sales will be subsidized with
commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,
inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete
at commercial prices in the Algerian market.
    Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced
November 10, 1986, it said.
    Details of the latest initiative, including an invitation
for offers from exporters, will be issued in the near future,
the department said.

Jersey said it will publish Garden State Home and Garden
monthly, beginning in September.
    The company said the publication was launched as a
bi-monthly in November 1986. The decision to covert to a
monthly was made as a result of increasing demand for
advertising space in the first four issues.
    The company also said it expects 1987 revenues of about
three mln dlrs, continuing average growth of over 50 pct for a
second year.
    A spokesman declined to release actual 1986, stating the
company had not completed its 10K report. For the first nine
months of 1986, it had sales of 1,070,000 dlrs while sales for
all of 1985 were a little less than one mln dlrs, he added.

proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil
to four countries are still under consideration by an
interagency trade policy group, a USDA official close to the

    The official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a
report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade
policy review group had rejected the proposals.
    Under the proposals, USDA would offer vegetable oil under
the export enhancement program, EEP, to four countries,
including 80,000 tonnes to Turkey and 60,000 tonnes to Algeria,
Morocco and Tunisia, industry sources said.
    The proposals "are still under review" by the interagency
working group, the USDA official said.

<TITLE>IRAN GAIN IN IRAQI TERRITORY SEEN INSIGNIFICANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States today dismissed as
insignificant gains by Iranian forces in Northern Iraq.
    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters
the gain in an area around Mount Kardemand had no signifficant
bearing on the seven-year-old Gulf war.
    Press reports from the region said the Iranian push had
placed its forces to move against the road to Rawandiz, some 60
miles (96 KM) north of major Iraqi oil fields and refineries
and the Turkish-Iraqi pipeline at Kirkuk.
    But Redman said the Iranian push "took place in an area of
Iraqi territory which is of little strategic value".
    "Actual possession of the area has seesawed between Iraq and
Iran since the early days of the war," he added.
    The Iranian push that captured the territory nearly two
weeks ago and reported in the American press this weekend, was
not a major offensive, Redman said.

&lt;Heritage Lite Meat Corp>, &lt;National Lean Beef Corp> and
&lt;Heritage Cattle &lt;Corp>. DNA said the total value of the
transactions is 700,000 dlrs.
    DNA said that when the transactions are approved by its
shareholders, it will issue additional shares of its common so
that Mize will own 80 pct of its issued and outstanding stock.
    DNA said Mize will replace its current chairman, Donald
Holbrook, who will remain on the board.
    The company also said it will continue in the medical
development business as "long as it is deemed to be
advantageous."

<TITLE>SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate budget committee sits
down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the
budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel
taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.
    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of
revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs
a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on
imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy
consumption based on five pct of value.
    Other proposals include various excise taxes and
combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10
pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise
22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.
    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers
in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left
to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.
     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen
Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at
least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36
billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.
    The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a
separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be
reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be
the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The trade surplus doubled in
february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below
the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.
    The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade
department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in
February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled
1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after
excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below
the same month last year.
    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.
    Fendt said that although the February results were lower
than the average expected for the rest of the year, the
government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987
should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
9.5 billion dlrs.
    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
government plans to foster economic growth.
    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
the traditional average for Brazil.
    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil
and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in
the same 1986 period.
    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian
industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly
compatible with the government's program for economic growth,
Fendt added.

<TITLE>SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an
alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,
Wall Street analysts said.
    "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
the works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with
L.F. Rothschild.
    "There are unquestionably other buyers out there," added
Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies have
looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."
    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,
and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts
said.
    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>,
Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also
seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
problems, the analysts added.
    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
Calif., company, analysts said.
    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
Fairchild management.
    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
completed within a reasonable period of time.
    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
the companies did not need government approval to complete the
transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
companies.
    "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
the U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F.
Rothschild.
    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
available for comment.
    Analysts noted the significance of the government's
apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
Fairchild.
    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
weapons systems.
    "The government really stood up for the semiconductor
industry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That, I think, is
the real significance of this."
    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
agreement signed last summer.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRAZIL'S TRADE SURPLUS DOUBLED IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's trade surplus doubled
in February to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln but was well
below the 628 mln dlrs of February last year, official figures
show.
    Director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade department
(CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in February
confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 1.53 billion
dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after excluding
coffee and oil derivatives, was only slightly below the same
month last year.
    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
in February, 1986, because of lower prices, he added.
    Fendt said although the February results were lower than
the average expected for the rest of the year, the government's
target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be
achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion
dlrs.
    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
government plans to foster economic growth.
    Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the
traditional average for Brazil.
    Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oil
and wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in
the same 1986 period.
    This rise reflected industry's need for equipment to raise
production and is perfectly compatible with the government's
program for economic growth, Fendt added.

<TITLE>UAW DENIES FORD &lt;F> SET AS TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers denied a
published report it is expected to pick Ford Motor Co to be the
prime target in its upcoming contract talks with the auto
industry.
    A UAW spokesman called "premature" a press report that the
union picked Ford over General Motors Corp &lt;GM> as the lead
company in talks expected to begin in mid to late July.
    Earlier, the Detroit Free Press, quoting local union
officials, said Ford would probably be picked as the auto
company to set the pattern for a negotiated settlement with the
entire U.S. car industry.
    According to the report, the fact that Ford earned more
money last year than GM will cause the union to select Ford as
the company with which the union will negotiate the
pattern-setting settlement.
    The UAW traditionally picks one of the major car companies
in its national contract talks with the auto industry, which
occur every three years.
    GM was named the lead company in the last round of talks in
1984.

Weizsaecker met Argentine President Raul Alfonsin for talks on
the first day of the German leader's four-day visit.
    Local officials placed great importance on the meeting
because Weizsaecker is considered a key backer here for more
flexible repyament terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    "I suppose (the debt) will be unavoidable" in talks, said
Juan Carlos Pugliese, speaker of the lower house of the
Argentine Parliament and one of Alfonsin's top political
allies, before the meeting.
    He said that "Germany in particular and most European
countries" have supported more liberal repyament terms for
Argentina's debt, Latin America's third largest.
    An Argentine mission is now in the United States concluding
negotiations on debt repyayment with 11 creditor banks.

<TITLE>SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A high-level meeting last week which
included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA
officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying
groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done
about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told
Reuters.
    "We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we
were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close
the door on anything," a member of the soybean delegation said.
    At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at
the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman
reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making
soybeans more profitable to grow than corn.
    But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in
relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support
to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.
    Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the
National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan
options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but
participants would not reveal what those options were.
    "There were no surprises in our package," one participant
said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of
offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in
certificates.
    The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with
77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not
have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.
    This would have the effect of lowering the world price,
maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the
government's soybean inventory.
    A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last
week's meeting, participants said.
    One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting
was a "listening session" for USDA, and that the proposals will
now be studied further by the Department.
    USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time
frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in
the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.
    "USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could
influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,"
a participant said.

<DATELINE>    SHREVEPORT, La., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royale Airlines Inc said its
load factor for February was 42.9 pct, up from 42.6 pct the
same period last year.
    Royale said it recorded 4,180,000 revenue passenger miles
compared to 5,681,000 the same period the year before.

higher load factor this past month.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consul Restaurant Corp chief financial
officer Robert Lamp told analysts a previously announced
conversion offer will reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to 55 pct
from 380 pct, assuming full acceptance of the offer.
    As of November 30, the company had about 26 mln dlrs of
total debt outstanding.
    Earlier, Consul said it would exchange 174,912 shares of
convertible preferred stock for 17.5 mln dlrs of outstanding 13
pct debentures.
    Lamp said that excess debt due to its withdrawal from the
Texas marketplace has been the key factor to blocking further
progress.
    The Mexican restaurant franchisee reported a net loss of
415,493 dlrs for the six months ended November 30, 1986.
    Acceptance of exchange offer by 90 pct of the debenture
holders will enable Consul to decrease its outstanding
indebtedness and report profitably beginning in the first
quarter of 1988, Lamp told analysts.

<TITLE>U.S. HEATING OIL FUTURES UP SHARPLY IN APRIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A supply shortage of number two oil in
New York for prompt delivery boosted the April heating oil
contract on U.S. energy futures, traders said.
    Crude oil futures followed but gasoline futures lagged.
April heating oil ended 1.24 cts higher to 51.65 cts a gallon,
while April crude settled 28 cts higher at 18.64 dlrs.
    "The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract,
which seemed to move higher because of tigtened prompt
deliveries in New York Harbor," said James Ritterbusch, vice
president at Paine Webber Inc in Chicago.
    April gasoline was 0.28 cent higher at 53.15 cts a gallon.
    Ritterbusch said the market also found support from a
report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC
oil output was down to about 14 mln barrels per day in the
second week of March.
    "There was not a lot of interest to sell the market because
of belief in OPEC," said Richard Redoglia, a broker with
Merrill Lynch Futures Inc.
    Redoglia and Ritterbusch said April heating oil could
continue to rally above 53 cts a gallon, while crude futures
could test 19 dlrs a barrel before profit-taking stunts the
move higher.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corporate raider Carl Icahn
acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
violations of securities laws.
    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
&lt;TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
    The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
and related rules, Icahn said.
    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
unspecified companies, he said.
    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
or their officers are the targets of government probes to
acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
to their shareholders.
    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
published reports.
    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
no filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" shares
of stock.
    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
concert would each amass stock in the company without
disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
    By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
controlled by a group acting in concert.
    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

<TITLE>SMITHKLINE &lt;SKB> AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is
pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
of the decade.
    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
    The company said in its annual report that its
nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
its pharmaceutical business.
    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
optimize its financial resources.
    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
by two joint ventures, one with &lt;Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
venture in Japan.
    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
annually.
    "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," Gavin
Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
dlrs.
    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
activator, over the next two years.
    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
testing for the AIDS antibody.
    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

<DATELINE>    ASHLAND, KY., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ashland Oil Inc said it expects to
report a loss from operations in the second quarter.
    The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs
net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay
down debt. "However, it is difficult to determine now whether
this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating
loss," the company said in a statement. A company spokesman
would not elaborate.
    The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss
in January and February since it was unable to raise product
prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.
    Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail
marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the
company's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are
expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.
    In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operations
of 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes,
equity income and other items.
    Net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs a
share on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>BRITISH FARM MINISTER ATTACKS SUBSIDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Farm subsidies and protectionist
moves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic,
Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, warned.
    "It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between
Europe and the United States," Jopling said in remarks prepared
for an evening speech.
    "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of
the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world
demand shrinks," he said.
    "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were
purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also
have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a
healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism
and excessive subisdies.
    "And above all, Europe and the United States have too many
common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars
and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no
one." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and the
European Community remain friends."
    Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee,
was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S.
officials in Washington later this week.
    Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under
consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.
    He said his government would oppose such a move because "We
do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support
(EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the
consumer's expense."

<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp Chairman A.W.
Clausen said the bank holding company is turning around and is
back on the road to profitability.
    In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,
Clausen said he was "absolutely convinced" BankAmerica would
return to its position of preeminence.
    "Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to
reduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan loss
problems and begin to reduce charge-offs, and to enhance our
revenue generation," Clausen said.
    Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position
this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.
    He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and
operations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased only
one pct over 1985 expenses.
    Clausen also said it will continue to phase out its
overseas retail banking and concentrate on wholesale banking,
with emphasis on a premium list of multinational corporations.

<TITLE>U.S. DECLINES COMMENT ON SCHLUMBERGER&lt;SLB> MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman
said the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd's
announcement that it had terminated an agreement in principle
to sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.
    Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the
venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time
soon. The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. Defense
Department, in part on national security grounds.
    Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the department
had had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal.
    A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware
of Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediate
reaction.
    Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had
joined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have
left the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for
vital equipment used in high-technology weapons.
    Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed from
ongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan,
officials said.

<TITLE>CONRAIL PUBLIC OFFERING TO BE LARGEST IN U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>In what may easily be the largest
initial public offering in U.S. history, Consolidated Rail Corp
estimated that the sale of its 59 mln government-owned shares
could earn the freight railroad as much as 1.7 billion dlrs.
    In an amended registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Conrail said its public
offering could come as early as next week and estimated its
shares will sell for between 26 and 29 dlrs each, slightly
higher than Conrail's initial prospectus had anticipated.
    A sale in this price range would net between 1.53 billion
dlrs and 1.7 billion dlrs for Conrail's 58.8 mln shares, with
52 million sold in North American and the remainder for sale in
an international offering.
    The previous largest initial U.S. public offering occurred
last May when the Henley Group Inc., a diverse collection of 38
companies spun off by Allied-Signal Corp, raised 1.19 billion
dlrs.
    In its initial prospecus filed with the SEC, Conrail had
estimated its government-owned shares would fetch only 22 to 26
dlrs a share, or a maximum of 1.52 billion dlrs.
    "We cannot comment on any question," said a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs and Co., one of the co-managers of the selling
syndicate. "The SEC is being extremely cautious," he said.
   Conrail was created by the government in the mid-1970s from
the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad and six other bankrupt or
failing Northeast railroads. After several years of large
losses, the railroad company turned its first profit in 1981.
    Last year Conrail earned 431 mln dlrs on revenues of 3.14
billion dlrs, down slightly from its 1985 profit of 442 mln
dlrs on revenues of 3.21 billion dlrs.
    Conrail operated its last passenger service in 1982.
    Legislation passed by Congress last year calling for the
public sale of Conrail set two billion dlrs as a target to be
raised.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Bank of Canada's &lt;RY> small
Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada
(Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an
expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada,
Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said.
    "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the
Canadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan told
reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of
Commerce.
    Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like
paper machinery and ships to Canada.
    He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities
for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an
agreement reached in January with international financial
authorities.
    Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled
roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada
reached about 700 mln dlrs.
    Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this
year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986
ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much
because of the country's uncertain financial climate.
    Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from
increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only
Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although &lt;Bank of
Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.
    Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an
equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68
billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is
essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a
position to resume debt repayments within a year.
    Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's
interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada.

<TITLE>BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> SAYS IT WILL MAKE DEBT OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp Chairman A.W.
Clausen said the bank holding company plans to go foward with
its one-billion-dlr debt offering, but declined to specify
when.
    Speaking to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Clausen
said that during the coming months, "at the appropriate time,
we will be placing or underwriting for equities."
    "We do need to improve our capital. We are in registration.
For the moment, we filed a one-billion-dlr shelf registration
for approval by the SEC, which we believe will be
approved very shortly," he said.
    On January 26, BankAmerica filed a shelf offering for up to
one billion dlrs of preferred stock and subordinated capital
notes.
    The offering was seen by the banking industry as one of the
major deterrents to First Interstate Bancorp's &lt;I> take over
bid, which it withdrew on February 9.
    Since then, banking analysts have speculated BankAmerica
may do well to defer action on the offering, while it continues
to attempt to improve its financial situation.
    Clausen said despite improvement in the past quarter,
BankAmerica must do more to improve its capital ratios.

Clausen said he believes Brazil will successfully restructure
its foreign debt sometime this year, but in the meantime that
country's creditors could suffer somwehat over the short term.
    He also said Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt
payments is most likely a move aimed at strengthening its
negotiating position.
    "I believe it was a posturing move on the part of the
country," Clausen said.
    Clausen made his comments during an address at a Chamber of
Commerce luncheon here.
    Last month Brazil, which has about 110 billion dlrs of
foreign debt, suspended payment on some 68 billion dlrs owned
to private banks while it worked out its economic problems.
    BankAmerica has some 2.74 billion dlrs in loans outstanding
to Brazil.
    Clausen also said he did not think any financial
institutions would be "done in" by Brazil's suspension of debt
payments and he added "I do not believe the International
Monetary Fund will come to a roaring halt."

<TITLE>CENTEL &lt;CNT> SEES LOWER FIRST QTR PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Centel Corp said it sees 1987 first
quarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits on
telephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from
1986 acquisitions.
    In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss told
shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by
ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and
structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth
in the investment base for setting rates.
    As such, its first quarter 1987 results will be below last
year's first quarter of 1.11 dlrs a share, he said.
    "Several of the company's telephone units may be faced with
a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their
regulators," Reuss said. "This could result in some rate
reductions and refunds to customers."
    Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress
in Centel's business communications, cable television and
cellular telephone units.
    Centel is asking shareholders at the annual meeting to
approve the tripling  to 120 mln in authorized shares.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc, which
disclosed that it does not intend to seek control of USAir
Group at this time, said it still believes a combination of the
two airlines would have benefits to both.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
TWA, which is controlled by Carl Icahn, said it continues to
closely watch the developments of USAir, which has an agreement
to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.
    TWA said it spent 178.2 mln dlrs to acquire its 4,043,200
USAir shares, which amount to 14.8 pct of its total outstanding
common stock.
    TWA said it would not buy more USAir Group stock, at least
for the moment.
    But it said it still believes a TWA-USAir combination would
"create certain synergies that would be mutually beneficial to
both carriers."
    TWA stressed that it reserved the right to revive its
takeover attempt and said it may continue to explore the
feasibility and strategies of gaining control of USAir.
    Further purchases of USAir stock would require the approval
of the Department of Transportation, TWA said.
    Because of Department of Transportation rules, TWA also
said it put its USAir stock into a voting trust with Fleet
National Bank as the voting trustee.
    The voting trust agreement requires the bank to vote in
favor of any acquisition agreement between TWA and USAir and to
opposed any other merger of USAir.

<TITLE>EC WARNS U.S. AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Mylrea, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) delivered
warnings to both Japan and the United States over trade
frictions which have hit relations between the Community and
its main trading partners.
    EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement
deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for
greater effort by the country to open its markets.
    Ministers also issued a statement saying they were
disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and
warned that the Community would react to any such moves.
    EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already
written to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns.
    The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the U.S.
moves, adding, "the adoption of such measures would not fail to
have a negative effect on the process of multilateral
negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations."
    Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but
to react according to the laws of the world trade body, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said.
    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
trade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."
    The statement added that the EC continued to insist that
the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate
demand.
    Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare
a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable
them to take action where necessary.
    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It wil
be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said.
    De Clercq told journalists, "There is a certain nervousness,
a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations
with Japan."
    But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue
talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than
embark on a costly and damaging trade war.

contractual agreements with its creditors.
    The company alleged that beginning in mid-1986, Coastal and
its chairman took various steps to acquire its gas and other
assets.
    Coastal has used TransAmerica's bankruptcy proceedings to
engineer a hostile takeover attempt, the company charged.
    In its suit TransAmerican alleged that Coastal and Wyatt
are "notorious corporate raiders who have been restrained in
the past from taking over other corporations in their attempt
to create a stranglehold position from which they could control
and raise gas prices..."
    "It is obvious that Coastal's efforts to improperly take
over TransAmerican is a thinly veiled attempt to control a
larger share of the Texas gas market to the detriment of end
users and consumers," the company alleged.
    Coastal could not be reached for comment. Company name is
Transamerican.

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> FILES SUIT AGAINST SOSNOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc said it filed a
lawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp
regarding its March 9 unsolicited tender offer for Caesars
World stock.
    The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the
Central District of California, charging the tender offer,
which its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and
federal margin regulations.
    The suit charges the offering materials are materially
false and misleading and misstate and conceal material
information required to be disclosed to shareholders.
    The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to
manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff
to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a
substantial profit.
    The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the
tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false
and misleading statements in the offer.
    Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor,
restructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an
attempt to fight off the bid.
    Sosnoff holds about 13.6 pct of the company's stock.

<TITLE>DEBT PROGNOSIS AGREED, BUT NO CURE IN SIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, MARCH 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin America urgently needs more money
if it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, but
fresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to
be in short supply.
    Bankers, officials and academics at a conference organized
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed the
importance of proper economic policies and increased private
investment. But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to
banish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's
380 billion dlr debt. "Such a solution is still not in sight,"
said Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.
    The conference was held against the background of the
recent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,
but it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who
spelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused
by the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.
    Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks
for a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will have
to grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply
to restore per capita income to the level of 1975.
    He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come
partly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone
will not be enough.
    "We have to reduce the transfer of resources," Brodersohn
said, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America
make this a matter of urgency.
    Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did not
spell out how this should be achieved.
    The creditors' strategy, spelled out by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in October 1985, is to spur additional
lending by private banks and multilateral development banks in
return for economic reforms.
    But there was a widespread recognition at the conference
that the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.
    Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-American
Development Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actually
declined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.
    Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that
will be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, which
called for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target
that Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said
is now optimistic.
    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan "has not
yet succeeded as well as we hoped."
    But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an
official commitment to try a new tack, they must have been
disappoiunted.
    Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviision
at the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted in
not lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.
    He said some streamlining of the lending process may be
needed, but added, "I see no alterantive to the present course
of responsible cooperation."
    A major theme at the conference, however, was that the
world economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors
and creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of
recession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America will
be even more hard-pressed to service its debts.
    Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that world
economic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and
that West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the
world economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade
deficit.
    "There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and
I don't know who's going to be rolled over," de Vries said. He
called for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options
as alternatives to pure new money.
    "Can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?"
he asked the conference.
    But new ideas take time to devise and implement, and
Brazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the
aptience of debtors might be wearing thin.
    Persio Arida, a former director of the Brazizlian central
bank who was a key architect of that country's Cruzado plan to
curb inflation, said there is an "incentive problem" throughout
Latin America.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community's (EC)
executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its
ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm
surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.
    Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and
Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which
has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led
by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.
    But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told
journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the
tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual
farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's
budget.
    He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind
up for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there will
be a formidable hole in the budget," he said.
    The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and
would be only slightly less this year, he said.
    Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead
of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as
unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers
recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.
    The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra
cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels
and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by
making it more competitive with other oils.
    Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil
producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the
tax.
    "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better
understood not just outside the community but at home," he said.
    Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the
EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to
impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats
could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other
countries.
    Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing
countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.
    The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle
Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border
subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations
for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.
    In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC
executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear
such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.
    Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at
the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had
been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of
the Commission's farm price proposals, he added.
   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the
EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese
opposition.
    The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of
unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it
into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.
    National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of
savings from another plan to curb milk production.
    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the
scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive
surpluses built up before they joined the community last year,
but the two countries did not block today's vote.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's current deficit narrowed
to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion (revised from
1.29 billion) in January, the Statistics Bureau said.
    This compared with an 897 mln dlr shortfall a year earlier.
    February merchandise trade recorded a 42 mln dlr surplus
against a 246 mln shortfall (revised from 287 mln) in January
and a 162 mln deficit in February 1986.
    The current account deficit fell at the lower end of the
range of forecasts of 700 mln to one billion dlrs made by
market economists yesterday.
    February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from 2.74
billion (revised from 2.72 billion) in January and 2.54 billion
a year earlier while FOB imports fell to 2.77 billion from 2.99
billion (revised from 3.01 billion) against 2.70 billion a year
earlier, the Bureau said.
    It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11
pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pct
rise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.
    On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pct
in machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, the
Bureau said.
    The net services deficit narrowed to 146 mln dlrs from 253
mln (revised from 268 mln) in January and 192 mln a year
earlier, the Bureau said.
    This made a sharply lower deficit of 104 mln dlrs on the
balance of goods and services against deficits of 499 mln in
January and 354 mln a year earlier.
    Deficit on net income and unrequited transfers was 646 mln
dlrs against 736 mln in January and 543 mln a year earlier.
    Official capital transactions in February showed a surplus
of 786 mln dlrs against a 2.56 billion surplus in January and a
505 mln surplus a year earlier.
    Non-official capital and balancing item showed a 36 mln dlr
deficit against a 1.33 billion deficit in January and a 392 mln
surplus in February 1986, the Bureau said.
    The cumulative current account deficit for the first eight
months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30 widened to 9.37 billion
dlrs from 9.32 billion a year earlier.
    The cumulative trade deficit narrowed to 2.09 billion dlrs
from 2.21 billion and the services deficit to 2.25 billion from
2.75 billion but the transfers deficit widened to 5.03 billion
from 4.36 billion. The cumulative official capital surplus
narrowed to 2.90 billion dlrs from 3.86 billion.

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS NO INTENTION TO ALTER SALES TAX BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he
had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill
introducing a sales tax.
    "Parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before
we see whether to revise it or not," Miyazawa told reporters.
    He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier
Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax.
    The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed
yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as
he saw growing public opposition.
    Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic
opposition boycott over their objections to the tax.
    Miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even
after Parliament completes its deliberations. He also said the
Government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional
budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1.
    The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press
speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than
1,000 billion yen.
    The Government is working on a provisional budget as the
chances of passing a full one by April 1 are virtually nil as a
result of the halt in parliamentary business, officials said.
    The Government wants to include as many economic stimuli as
possible in the provisional budget to boost domestic demand,
increase imports and reduce its trade surplus, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's overall wholesale price index
(base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to
86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bank
of Japan said.
    Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December.
    The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st
straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said.
    The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the
recovery in world crude oil prices, it said.
    On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around
17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January.
    The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8
pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up
16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said.
    The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a
month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like
cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign
competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier.
    The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to
57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to
the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index
was down 29 pct from a year earlier.
    The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February,
its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in
prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to
severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added
to the decline.
    The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier.
    The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of
7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling
such statistics in 1960 under its current system.
    Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as
higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected,
the bank said.

<TITLE>CREDITORS/DEBTORS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY-WEIZSAECKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker said both debtor and creditor nations share
responsibility for the Third World's foreign debt crisis.
    Weizsaecker, in a speech on the first day of an official
visit to Argentina, said: "Debtor and creditor countries have
created this situation jointly. They also share responsibility
for finding lasting solutions."
    Local officials have payed great importance to
Weizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer of
more flexible repayment terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr
foreign debt, Latin America's third largest.
    Weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him by
President Raul Alfonsin at Buenos Aires' City Council hall,
also said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacle
posed by the foreign debt to countries like Argentina.
    "Democracy in Latin America must not be endangered because
of misery or new injustices," he said.
    Argentine officials said they might halt debt payments last
month if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlr
loan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11
banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure
the loan.
    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with the
European Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain
exports.
    "We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of
balanced interest from all parties," he said.
    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly
into the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.
    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a Latin
American tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala. He held
brief talks on Sunday with Brazilian President Jose Sarney
during a stopover in Brasilia.

<TITLE>EC AGREES ON AID PACKAGE FOR MEDITERRANEAN STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) foreign
ministers have agreed on an aid package of loans and grants
totalling more than 1.6 billion European Currency Units (Ecu)
for states in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region.
   The five-year accord increases aid to the states, Tunisia,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria, by
about 60 pct from the previous pact, Belgian Foreign Minister
Leo Tindemans told a news conference. The EC's executive
Commission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion
Ecus, about 70 pct more than the last aid deal, but West
Germany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct.
    The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the
EC, while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in
loans from the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term
investment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed
will be worked out by EC officials.
    Syria, while still officially included on the list, will
not receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to
it. The EC last year imposed sanctions against Syria because of
its alleged role in the attempted bombing of an Israeli
airliner.

<TITLE>STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strikes against a government freeze on
wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the
official news agency Tanjug said last night.
    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials
feared more strikes were on the way.
    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in
the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were
in the northern republic of Croatia.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last
month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an
annual rate of almost 100 pct.
    The government froze wages at their level in the fourth
quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to
productivity.
    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior
executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the
freeze in interviews with Tanjug.
    The agency said strikes took place last week in the
southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia
and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in
Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.
    Earlier, Yugoslav journalists, who asked to remain
anonymous, told Reuters they had been barred from strike-hit
factories.
    They said they had been told they could not enter without
permits, whereas before the strikes no permits had been
necessary to visit factories.

<TITLE>CONSERVATIVES MAKE MAJOR GAINS IN FINNISH POLLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finland's Conservatives emerged with
major general election gains after a swing away from the left.
    Conservative Party leader Ilkka Suominen told reporters
"they can't keep us out of government now" after the Party gained
nine Parliamentary seats in elections held on Sunday and
Monday, taking its total to 53 seats.
    With 99 pct of votes counted, Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa's
Social Democratic Party had lost just one seat despite a 2.5
pct drop in support.
    The Social Democrats held 57 seats in the last 200-seat
parliament, the Conservatives 44 and the Centre Party 37.
    It may take weeks for the political complexion of the new
government to take shape as major parties negotiate to see
which grouping can form a majority. But the result is expected
to be a change from the outgoing centre-left coalition.
    Political commentators said the results will have
far-reaching implications as they showed a significant swing
from the left, which has dominated post-war Finnish politics.
    Despite the Conservative revival, commentators said there
would be no immediate change in foreign policy, which is
moulded by Finland's sensitive position in the shadow of the
neighbouring Soviet Union.
    The environmentalist "Greens" doubled their seats in
parliament to four, although opinion polls had forecast they
would win 10.
    The Communists split for the first time into pro-Moscow
Stalinists and Eurocommunists. The Eurocommunists retained
their 17 seats, while the Stalinists, expelled from the
official Communist Party in 1986, lost six of their 10 seats.

<TITLE>POINDEXTER MAY GET IMMUNITY TO HELP TRACK FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional investigators
tentatively plan to grant immunity to former presidential
National Security Advisor John Poindexter who they say may help
track missing money from Iran arms sales.
    Congressional sources told Reuters the House of
Representatives and Senate committees probing the arms scandal
are expected to back a preliminary accord reached last Friday
by their legal advisors to grant Poindexter immunity from
prosecution in return for his testimony. He would be the first
leading figure in the affair to be granted immunity.
    Poindexter resigned from his White House post in November
when it was divulged that up to 30 mln dlrs in arms sales
profits might have been diverted to Nicaraguan contra rebels.
Congressional investigators and a presidential review
commission have not tracked beyond secret Swiss and Cayman
Island bank accounts mlns of dlrs said to have been diverted.
    The sources said Poindexter could help trace the money,
which is one of the big riddles of the scandal. "Obviously we
think he is a very important witness," said a House source.
    Poindexter has refused to testify before Congress, citing
his constitutional rights against self-incrimination.

<TITLE>TOYOTA SEEN GETTING MANILA APPROVAL FOR CAR OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> of Japan is
expected to get approval from a Philippine government agency to
produce cars and other items here, government sources said.
    This follows the company's proposal to invest about 400 mln
pesos and generate about 100 mln dlrs in export earnings over
five years.
    The sources said Toyota is likely to be brought into the
government-backed Progressive Car Manufacturing Program (PCMP),
which since the 1970s has controlled the number of car makers.
The PCMP is administered by the Board of Investments (BOI),
which screens investments by foreigners and locals.
    The sources said Toyota had also applied to produce wiring
harness, hardboard and ferro-silicone for local and export
markets. It has not yet said what kind of cars it will make.
    The sources did not say when BOI would announce its
decision on the Toyota application.
    In 1984 Toyota severed its ties with &lt;Delta Motor Corp>,
its local partner for more than 20 years, because the latter
was suffering financial difficulties. The state-owned
Philippine National Bank later foreclosed on Delta's assets and
the sources said Toyota is now negotiating to buy these.
    The government sources also said Toyota was in the final
stages of negotiations with a new local partner.
    Toyota would be the third participant in the PCMP, joining
&lt;Pilipinas Nissan Inc> and &lt;Philippine Automotive Manufacturing
Corp>, formerly Canlubang Automotive Resources Corp.
    Two U.S. Car firms, General Motors Corp &lt;GM.N> and Ford
Motor Co &lt;F.N>, withdrew from the local car market shortly
after the country was hit by a financial crisis in 1983.

<TITLE>DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,
and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan
takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris
accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.
    "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of
150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealer
at one leading bank said.
    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at
around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a
meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.
    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,
but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed
inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.
    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package
Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its
trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would
probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.
    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of
measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost
domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.
    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition
boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition
of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim
chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near
future, the dealers said.
    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the
U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on
the dollar, they said.
    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed
since before the Paris accord, they added.
    "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to
a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt
crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest
payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the
Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms
scandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.
    "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to
around 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical Bank
Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.
    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way
for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.
    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.
Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for
quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar
when it rose to 1.87 marks.
    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London
when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.
    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central
bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline
because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying
intervention as a chance to sell dollars.
    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch
assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will not
show drastic movement at least to the end of March."
    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any
strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books
for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar
would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on
their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any
comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.

<TITLE>MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian dollar rose more than 40
points and money market interest rates retreated on the better
than expected improvement in the February current account
deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about
identifying it as the start of a downward trend.
    The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in
February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion
dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.
    The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as
high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.
    "It's got 69 cents written all over it," one dealer said.
    Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on
the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30
points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.
    The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts
and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one
billion dlrs for March.
    Banque National de Paris &lt;BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter
Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and
interest rates were too high for import substitution and export
industries.
    Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875
and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.
    &lt;Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said
the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at
2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.
    But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal
exports remained poor. "We should remember we are paying
something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service
our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near
term," Buttrose said.
    Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln
dlrs, and added "Any figure under a billion dollars will be
acceptable (to the markets)."
    ANZ Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little
said the big question was whether the improvement in exports
could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion
dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.
    Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with
90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early
highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.
    Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct
from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.
    The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said
the current account data had little impact on trading.

<TITLE>CHINA IMPOSES QUOTAS TO CUT LOSS OF FARMLAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>China will set quotas later this month
to cut the amount of farmland converted to non-agricultural
uses, the China Daily said.
    The quotas will restrict the conversion of farmland to
farmers' housing or construction by state departments and
collective institutions and enterprises.
    The newspaper quoted Wang Xianjin, general director of the
State Land Administration, as saying the 1987 quota would be
below the 320,000 hectares lost in 1985. Land loss and
population growth have cut cultivated land per person to
one-tenth of a hectare, half the amount of the early 1950s.

widened to a record 16.62 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986

<TITLE>EC WARNS U.S. AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) yesterday
warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,
that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations
with both countries.
    EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's
continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make
a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they
were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that
would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were
prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already
distanced itself from the bill.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written
to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
outlining the EC's concerns.
    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.
Moves towards protectionism. "The adoption of such measures
would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of
multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral
relations," it said.
    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but
to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, it said.
    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."
    The statement said the EC would continue to insist that
Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.
    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a
report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them
to take appropriate action where necessary.
    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It will
be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said.
    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,
"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the
Community concerning trade relations with Japan."
    The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its
trade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approach
on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it has
imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties.
    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo
to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and
damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more
cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

<TITLE>CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Buoyed by low fuel prices and
favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's
&lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's
forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.
    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings
of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports
results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.
    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made
its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in
May last year.
    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making
a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the
prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.
    They said the airline's performance improved in the second
half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln
dlrs.
    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one
U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's
favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time
of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.
    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline
industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the
1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would
affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits
of 1.25 billion dlrs.
     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and
currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.
    "This is reflected in their interim results which showed
that profit margin has increased," said Frederick Tsang of
Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.
    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier
levels, but profits rose 69 pct.
    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on
the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices
usually lag behind crude price movements by several months,
analysts said.
    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the
Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and
sterling 12 pct.
    "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against
Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields
in the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel. "This should
continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to
end the year up 7.6 pct."
    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash
under management also improved profits, James Capel said.
    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed
to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor
declined because of increased competition and an expansion of
its fleet and services.
    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown
last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown
climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell
to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.
    "Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes
last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,"
said Tsang. "This affected its load factor."
    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong
Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's
decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts
said.

<TITLE>RENISON GOLDFIELDS EXTENDS LYELL COPPER MINE LIFE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open
for an extra five years following a new aid package from the
state government, RGC said in a statement.
    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40
series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the
deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.
    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the
local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and
justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of
about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.
    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep
contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000
tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln
dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.
    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a
major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast
of Tasmania.
    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10
mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr
advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions
and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Independent Newspapers Ltd> (INL)
said it bought two more community newspapers in Houston, Texas,
through a subsidiary there, for an undisclosed sum.
    INL said in a statement &lt;Houston Community Newspapers Inc>
bought the South West Advocate and the South Bend Advocate,
with combined circulation of 74,000 copies, and associated
assets, from &lt;The Advocate Communications Corp Inc>.
    INL publishes Wellington's morning and evening newspapers
as well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in
Rhode Island. Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by &lt;News Ltd>,
an Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd &lt;NCPA.S>.
    Production and administration of the two publications would
be transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. INL
said the acquisition took effect on March 1.
    INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the
subsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine
community newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston
area. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult
because the city's economy depends to a large extent on the
fortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should
improve in the medium to long term and the investment will
prove to be sound, he said.

<TITLE>INDIA PREPARES TO LAUNCH INTERCONTINENTAL ROCKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGALORE, India, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>India is preparing to launch
its first intercontinental-range rocket, which it insists is
part of a purely peaceful space program.
    But a space department official who did not wish to be
identified said the Augmented Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV), with
the range of an intercontinental rocket and able to carry a
150-kg satellite, could be converted into a weapon after
modifications.
    Space Commission Chairman Udipi Ramachandra Rao said the
ASLV will be launched between March 20 and April 5, depending
on weather and other factors.
    "This launch will pave the way for the most important stage,
by the end of 1989, when we test the Polar Space Launch Vehicle
(PSLV)," Rao told Reuters.
    The space department official said the PSLV would be able
to launch 1,000-kg satellites into polar orbit.
    Rao said a successful ASLV launch could speed up the space
program slightly but was not likely to solve the problem of a
backup satellite for India's Insat 1B.
    Insat 1B handles telephone communications, controls 182 of
the country's 187 television stations and provides
meteorological data for farmers.
    "It is a great worry that we do not have a second satellite
to back up Insat 1B in case it fails. Even with Insat 1C's
launch by Ariane in the first quarter of 1988, we will still be
in trouble because the life of Insat 1B ends in 1989," Rao said.
    He said India plans to send up Insat 1D as soon as possible
as a backup for Insat 1C, but will have to wait for a place on
a NASA or Ariane launch vehicle. "We can't use Soviet vehicles
because the satellites are made in the United States," he said.

<TITLE>KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will
extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to
use the exchange.
    Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry
approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at
1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the
new session the following day before the opening call starts at
0930 local time, an Exchange official said.
    Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer
price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after
the end of the current final session here.
    The introduction of the new session will enable
participants to trade overnight after taking account of
Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are
designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume
traded overnight to the new final session before the opening
session starts next day, the official said.
    But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which
sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts
traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth
session, he added.
    Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve
the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures
industry to expand and internationalise.
    The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which
also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to
introduce an extra session.
    TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four
sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,
but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time.

<TITLE>COASTAL &lt;CGP> SEEKS TO HALT BILLION DLR LAWSUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy
court will hear its request today for a restraining order to
stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmerican
Natural Gas Corp>.
    TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit
to block Coastal from taking control.
    Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which
is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its
own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.
    Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves
and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an
undisclosed amount.
    TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values
its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about
one billion dlrs.
    The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in
Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and
over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
    About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot
market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.
    Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay
its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The
lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one
billion in punitive damages from Coastal.
    Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market
since 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering
Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas
customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.
    Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,
earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about
half the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.

<TITLE>STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A government study has concluded the
U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
    It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
current 8.4 mln barrels.
    The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
depletion allowance to major producers.
    "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added.
    The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.
Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

<TITLE>CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HANGZHOU, China, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's grain imports will rise
in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but
will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and
Japanese traders told Reuters.
    They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy
would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked
at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.
    An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put
maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73
mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.
    Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor
harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,
which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.
    "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official
said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world
prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a
major importer."
    A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports
would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,
low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and
animal consumption.
    "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain
it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly
needs," the trader said.
    The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is
affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce
the summer grain harvest from last year's level.
    The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying
enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it
difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln
tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.
    "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest
area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and
high-yield cash crops," it said.
    It added factory production might have to be reduced to
provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight
the drought.
    Since January, the press has devoted much attention to
grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's
economic and political stability and that prices paid to
farmers are too low.
    Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain
production is a key state policy and outlined the measures
being taken in their areas to encourage output.
    The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of
the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise
agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set
aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the
70,000 workers available to help farmers.
    Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside
Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three
years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.
    Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of
Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain
output in his province.
    "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,
raising the level of science and technology on the farms and
improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other
infrastructure," he said.
    The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in
industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their
spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,
they lease the land to grain farmers.
    The China Daily said last month that grain output should
reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480
and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made
profitable.
    "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually
yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by
intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.
Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said.

<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea proposed a meeting of prime
ministers to improve relations with North Korea, but said the
two countries must first restore mutual trust.
    South Korean Prime Minister Lho Shin-yong proposed in a
letter to his North Korean counterpart Li Gun-mo that they meet
to "discuss ... Various issues raised by the two sides to
improve relations and ease tension."
    The letter, released to the media by a government
spokesman, said if the proposed meeting took place it would
open the way for summit talks between South Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung.
    The letter was in reply to a recent North Korean call for
high-level political and military talks.
    Lho said the prime ministers could discuss any proposal to
be made by the North, once "the minimum conditions for mutual
trust have been created by the convening of a water resources
meeting and the resumption of the suspended dialogues."
    Lho was referring to discussions on a controversial
northern dam project Seoul has said is aimed at flooding large
areas of the South, and to a resumption of stalled talks on
trade and humanitarian issues.

<DATELINE>    DAMASCUS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government proposed a 1987 budget
of up to 41.7 billion Syrian pounds, a 4.8 pct decrease from
last year's allocation.
    Finance minister Qahtan Seyoufi told parliament last night
the reduction was due mainly to a cut in investment
allocations.
    Planned recurrent spending of 24.2 billion pounds, almost
unchanged from 1986, took account of national security needs
and "Syria's role in steadfastness and liberation," he said.
    The budget, which is still subject to approval by
parliament and by President Hafez al-Assad, also aims to meet
mounting spending on education, health and essential imports.
    Power and water projects would take up 43.5 pct of
investment allocations of 17.5 billion pounds and agriculture
about 20 pct, Seyoufi said.
    The budget's basic goals were to restrict current spending,
curb inflation and step up reliance on local resources, he
said.

<TITLE>JAPAN OCTOBER/DECEMBER GNP RISES 0.8 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's gross national product (GNP) rose
a real 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter after an
upwardly revised 0.7 pct increase the previous three months,
the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.
    The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been
put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2
pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.
    In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7
pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst
since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the
strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.
    In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December
quarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in
the previous three months, the Agency said.
    Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December,
after a one pct rise the previous quarter.
    Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real
GNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2.
The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.
    In July/September, domestic demand contributed one
percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off
0.3 point.
    Of the 0.2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last
quarter, falling exports knocked off 0.2 while falling imports
contributed 0.4 point.
    Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter in
October/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct.
    Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to
October/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for
0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.
    The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for
housebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for
stockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N> decision to
end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> to buy
80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political
furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese
companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High
technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry
analysts said.
    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to
Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by
the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.
    "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's
North American operations, but it would have been a great
boost," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.
    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending
the agreement because mounting political controversy in the
U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake
could be completed in a reasonable time.
    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and
Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.
    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the
Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North
American sales and distribution system and access to
microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,
analysts said.
    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional
microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the
U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.
    "It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a
marketing channel for other things," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd
analyst Rick May.
    Several analysts said the purchase would not have given
Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.
    "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a
thing of the past," May said.
    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as
it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to
modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.
    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese
firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High
tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.
    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly
route of expanding its own production and distribution
facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the
estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to
acquire some less politically symbolic firm.
    "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the
necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in
America remains," said Capel's Murtha. "The Japanese will
continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find
ones that are politically acceptable."
    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or
smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash
that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. "They're not
going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...
Because of the political risk," said Barclays de Zoete's May.
    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct
shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super
minicomputer makers, he said.
    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up
harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational
tie-ups, some analysts said.
    "This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either," said
Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. "The
pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --
why should the government step in to prevent it?"
    Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime
Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.
Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.
    "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter
for governments' comment," Tamura said. "I think it was improper
for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they
did," he said.
    A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that
international investment flows ought to be free and that such
flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing
closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 300 BILLION YEN IN BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell 300 billion
yen of financing bills tomorrow under a 55-day repurchase
accord maturing on May 12, money traders said.
    The bills are meant to soak up a projected money market
surplus due largely to coupon and principle payments of a
previously issued Japanese National Railways bond.
    The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities
houses from money houses will be 3.9497 pct against the 3.9375
pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the
4.43/32 pct yield on two-month certificates of deposit today.
The sale will raise the bill supply to 1,500 billion yen.

<TITLE>S.KOREA SAYS JAPAN COMPLAINS TO GATT ON TRADE PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has complained to the secretariat
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South
Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan
breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.
    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month
alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more
from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating
non-tariff trade barriers.
    South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped
to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by
1991.
    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45
billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two
months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.
    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to
import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.
    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one
step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea
to the negotiating table and stop the plan.
    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import
restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean
goods to help reduce the trade deficit.

<TITLE>JAPAN SEEN REDUCING BEEF, PORK INTERVENTION PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Ministry is expected to
reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in
1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been
set yet, industry sources said.
    Production prices, the basis for setting intervention
prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed
prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.
    Last November an advisory panel urged the government to
work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to
levels closer to international values, the sources added.
    In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation
zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.
    The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government
Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock
operation in the wholesale market.
    The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be
set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the
Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on
March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or
bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is
1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.
    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is
1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540
yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.
    They said the domestic beef intervention price influences
imported beef selling prices on the domestic market.
    Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government
body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or
processors in line with the standard price of other beef
categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef
prices, they said.

    The deficit will widen by 33 pct to a record 73.97 billion

71.76 billion. Economic construction and communications will
receive 82.68 billion against 85.49 billion, and education

dlrs, accounting for 20.8 pct of the total.
    Income from sales of property and fines imposed by the
government will bring in 28.59 billion dlrs, 5.9 pct of the
total.
    The 1987/88 deficit will be covered by the issue of
government bonds worth 59.5 billion dlrs and a budget surplus
of 13.54 billion from the current year.
    The cabinet allocated 16.92 billion dlrs to cover a 10 pct
rise in civil service salaries.
    Central government revenue, excluding proceeds from sales
of government bonds, but including the carried over current
year budget surplus, will rise 6.6 pct to 419.24 billion dlrs.
    Total capital investment by the central government, local
governments and state-owned corporations will increase 38 pct
to 330 billion Taiwan dlrs, the statement said.

shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 650 mln stg while banker's balances below target will take
out around 50 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
and a fall in note circulation will add some 200 mln stg and 50
mln stg to the system respectively.

<TITLE>HONDA SHIFTS SOME MOTORCYCLE PRODUCTION TO U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Honda Motor Co Ltd &lt;HMC.T> said it
shifted production of motorcycles with engine capacity of 700
cc and bigger for sale in the U.S. To its wholly owned
subsidiary &lt;Honda Motor of America Inc> in Ohio, partly due to
the yen's appreciation against the dollar.
    A parent company spokesman said the Ohio plant, which makes
360,000 cars a year, is now also producing 1,100 cc and 1,200
cc motorcycles, partly for export.
    Motorcycle output in Ohio totalled 28,000 in 1986, down 33
pct from a year earlier, but the shift in production will raise
production to 44,000 in 1987, the spokesman said.
    The move to the U.S. Of large motorcycle manufacturing was
also due partly to higher U.S. Tariffs for imported motorcyles
bigger than 700 cc, industry sources said.
    The U.S. Imposed tariffs on imports of large motorcycles
from April 1983, starting at 49.9 pct and gradually falling, to
help the U.S. Motorcycle manufacturing industry to reconstruct,
the sources said. The tariff for U.S. Fiscal year 1987/88 is
set at 14.5 pct.
    They said the U.S. Planned to cut the tariff to 4.4 pct for
fiscal 1988/89, but that the higher level is likely to be kept
for a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia has stopped sending its copper
exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia
said.
    The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as
saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but
it did not say which alternative routes were being used.
    ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but
Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all
Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA
line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.
    During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped
through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only
other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.
    Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian
mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he
added.
    Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to
98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President
Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital
for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the
traditional route through South Africa.
    Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in
economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an
interview on March 1, "My main concern, of course, is the mines
because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines."
    According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of
freight last year and is still working well below its present
1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been
completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and
dependable routes his government would look to increase its
usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.
    The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal
Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal
exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus
79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell
to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.
    Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's
export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed
reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira
ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they
could be hauled there by train.
    "The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form
handle the huge exports of Zambian copper," one western diplomat
said.
    "A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets
could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports
which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper
tonnage," he added.

    The equipment, developed by Royal Dutch/Shell Group

into oil wells to increase oil production.
    The sources said the Hungarian company, Chemokomplex, has
asked the World Bank for money to buy the equipment. Hungary
gets 90 pct of its crude oil from the Soviet Union.

December, the OECD said.
    But monthly inflation throughout the OECD was an average
0.4 pct in January, a rise compared to the 0.2 pct in the last

still 11.6 pct lower than a year earlier, the OECD said.
    The increase in consumer prices excluding food and energy,
at 0.4 pct in January for the whole OECD area, was unchanged on
the four previous months, but over the year to January OECD
consumer prices rose by 3.5 pct, against 3.3 pct in December.
    Unadjusted annual inflation for the seven leading
industrialised nations in January was running at 4.4 pct in
Italy, 3.9 pct in Britain and Canada, three pct in France, 1.4
pct in the U.S., Minus 0.8 pct in West Germany and minus 1.5
pct in Japan, the OECD said.

for broking firms facing financial problems because of the

contracts with Pan-Electric, which went into receivership in
November 1985 owing 390 mln dlrs. The company was wound up last

suspended repayments of principal on its debts in order to
start renegotiating its obligations with banks next month, a
company spokesman said.
    He said the decision did not affect payment of interest on
loans and debentures.
    FECSA faces repayments of 60 billion pesetas in interest
and 30 billion pesetas in principal this year.
    The Madrid stock exchange suspended trading in FECSA shares
on February 6, saying the company was unable to meet payments
on its 594 billion peseta debt.
    Foreign banks hold almost half the debt.
    The spokesman said FECSA was sending telexes to its
creditors to set dates for the renegotiation. It would seek
longer repayment deadlines and lower interest rates.
    He said banks had insisted on a formal declaration that
FECSA was suspending principal repayments before discussing a
renegotiation of its debts.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian sugar output is forecast by
the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987
against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture
Minister Achmad Affandi said.
    Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import
sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against
1.728 mln in 1985.
    The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on
Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower
than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln
tonnes and forecast little change for 1987.
    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end
of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks.
    Affandi told reporters stocks fe&#127;l to as low as 159,000
tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this
represented under one month's consumption.
    The minister said Indonesia should hold three months'
supply, or 510,000 tonnes.
    A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which
distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were
489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community cereal trade
lobby Coceral has written to Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen
asking for talks on ways of preventing their members losing
money as a result of future realignments of currencies in the
European Monetary System.
    In the text of a letter made available to journalists,
Coceral says some members suffered considerable losses on
contracts entered into just before the last realignment in
January.
    This was because of an unforeseeable increase in monetary
compensatory amounts (MCA's) for some member states, it says.
    Coceral estimates losses sustained by West German traders
who are its members at 8.05 mln marks.
    It says Andriessen should work out new regulations to
prevent a repetition of such losses as a result of future
realignments.
    A Coceral spokesman said problems had arisen when traders
importing cereals from weak currency countries into those with
strong currencies bought the weak currencies with which they
were to pay for the cereals forward.

individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign
stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.
    All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and
exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only
invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and
certificates of deposit.
    Central bank and other government officials were not
available to comment on the report.
    Economists said it was likely that the government would
ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.
    They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly
from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a
target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion
U.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985.
    "The central bank has to go in this direction," said Su
Han-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank
of China. "If they don't quicken the pace, Washington could
retaliate and really damage Taiwan."

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's current account payments surplus
slipped to a provisional 300 mln francs, seasonally adjusted,
in January from a downward revised surplus of 3.8 billion in

billion franc deficit after a revised 7.1 billion December
surplus. The December unadjusted surplus was revised down from
a provisional 8.2 billion.
    The Ministry said trade, measured on balance of payments
criteria, showed an unadjusted 7.1 billion franc January
deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.
    Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed
a 1.8 billion deficit.
    The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1
billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit

<TITLE>U.K. FEBRUARY PSBR REPAYMENT 300 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) showed a provisional net repayment of 300
mln stg in February, compared with an unrevised 3.7
billion stg repayment in January, the Treasury said.
    This gives a cumulative PSBR in the first 11 months of the
current fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billion
requirement in the like period last year.
    The government's forecast for the PSBR in fiscal 1986/87 is
7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot on
this number. The February data was within market forecasts.
    The Central Government Borrowing Requirement on its own
account in February was a net repayment of 100 mln stg after a
unrevised net repayment of 3.4 billion stg in January. In the
first 11 months, the central government borrowing on its own
account was 2.3 billion stg, after 2.1 billion in January.
    Local Authorities made a repayment estimated at 100 mln stg
in February. The cumulative local authorities' repayment for
the first 11 months was 700 mln. The Treasury said the fall
about 2.5 billion stg in the cumulative PSBR at this point this
year over last was largely due to lower public corporation and
local authority borrowing. This was also the case last month,
it said.
    The Public Corporations' Borrowing Requirement is estimated
at minus 400 mln stg, to give a cumulative repayment of 1.4
billion stg.
    The local authority and public sector surplus on the 11
months cumulative basis was 2.1 billion, compared with a flat
position at the same stage last year.
    The Treasury said that the proceeds from privatisation of
&lt;British Airways Plc> reduced requirements by 400 mln stg.
    The Treasury said the General Government Borrowing
Requirement is estimated to be a net repayment of 100 mln stg
in February, giving a cumulative requirement of 1.1 billion.
    Consolidated fund revenue was 8.8 billion stg in February,
giving a cumulative total of 101.4 billion in the first 11
months, 4.5 pct up from the like stage last year.
    Inland Revenue Receipts for the first 11 months were 1.8
billion stg, or 3.5 pct higher than a year earlier. Receipts
from Customs and Excise were 3.5 billion stg in the first 11
months, 10.5 pct higher than in the previous year.
    The Treasury said that budget forestalling, when traders
bring in goods in advance of today's annual budget, brought in
300 mln stg more in customs and excise receipts than in
February 1986.
    Consolidated fund expenditure was 8.4 billion stg in
February, with a cumulative 102.5 billion for the first 11
months, four pct higher than in the previous year.
    Supply expenditure was provisionally estimated at 8.3
billion stg in February, giving a cumulative total of 91.2
billion or three pct above last year's equivalent total.

<TITLE>ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's
state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65
pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural
industry sources said.
    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to
around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60
pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial
farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.
    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries
since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food
shortage in Zimbabwe.
    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000
tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,
which means that even with the sharply reduced production this
year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.
    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a
25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from
248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean
deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Industrial production rose a
provisional 0.4 pct in January after a 0.6 pct decline in
December 1986, figures from the Central Statistical Office
show.
    The index for industrial production, base 1980, was set at
a seasonally adjusted 109.8 in January after December's 109.4
and compared with 108.2 a year earlier.
    Output of manufacturing industries fell a provisional 2.3
pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise last December.
    The index for manufacturing, base 1980, fell to 103.9 from
106.3, and compared with 102.3 a year earlier.
    The CSO said industrial production in the three months to
January was provisionally estimated to have fallen by 0.7 pct
from the level of the previous three months, while
manufacturing output rose by 0.5 pct in the same period.
    In the three months, industrial production was 1.5 pct
higher than in the same period a year earlier, while
manufacturing output was two pct higher.
    Within manufacturing, output of the metals industry rose by
six pct and that of engineering and allied industries by one
pct between the two latest three month periods. Output of
chemicals and textiles fell by one pct and minerals by two pct.
    The Office said output of the investment goods industries
rose 0.1 pct while consumer goods output increased 0.6 pct.
    Output of intermediate goods fell 1.6 pct between the two
latest three-month periods.
    The figures showed the energy production index, base 1980,
rose 7.2 pct in January to 126.4 from December's 117.9 and from
124.6 in January 1986.
    In the latest three months, the energy index, which
comprises oil, natural gas and coal production, was down 3.5
pct on the previous quarter and 0.5 pct below the same period a
year earlier.

<DATELINE>    HARARE, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zimbabwe's real gross domestic product
increased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures
published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This
contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.
    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was
a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined
12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous
year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing
production increased 1.4 pct.
    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to
8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP
deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no
growth in real output during 1986.

<TITLE>JAPAN SAYS U.S.-JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese officials sought to convince the
U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead
of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their
case.
    "We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the
situation does not run counter to the pact," Osamu Watanabe,
Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's
(MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.
    "The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking
are emerging in the market place," he said.
    U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese
microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at
below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.
    The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting
predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.
Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market.
    The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime
Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on
the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.
    Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics
Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below
cost in third countries.
    MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut
production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this
year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in
the non-regulated grey market, Honda said.
    "The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but
in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding
market share because of their cheaper prices," Honda said.
    MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess
supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the
pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor
exports to the United States, he added.
    The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines
for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are
likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.
    Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any
artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should
bring positive results, Watanabe said. "I am optimistic," he
added.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI CORPORATE DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bankers in Saudi Arabia are negotiating
a delicate balance between western business practice and
oriental justice as they try to restructure the troubled
corporate sector's debt.
    The problem lies in reconciling Saudi Arabia's
western-style banking system and an Islamic, "Sharia" legal
system in which interest payments may be viewed as usury and
illegal.
    So Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks have pinned hopes on
negotiated settlements rather than enforced ones, and are
resigned to not being able to recoup loans in full.
    And they have become highly selective over enterprises
eligible for new credit after a run of failures that forced
heavy loan loss provisions and ate relentlessly into profits.
    As a result, they have attracted complaints from a business
community that says it is starved of funds while the government
is criticising it for not playing a larger role in the economy.
    The private sector's downturn began in earnest in 1983 as
oil prices slid and some companies were slow to react,
businessmen said. Bloated inventories and in some cases poor
management created problems. Some also blamed the government
for not paying for public sector contracts promptly.
    Long negotiations to reschedule some debt are now producing
results. One banker said, "Banks are agreeing reschedulings, but
often at a high price... They are resigned to the fact that
full recovery (of loans) is not always possible."
    In a few cases private sector firms have been stripped of
assets during or prior to debt renegotiations, leaving banks
virtually no hope of repayment in full.
    The first major rescheduling was not sealed until
mid-February this year when &lt;Arabian Auto Agency>, known as
AAA, reached agreement to stretch out repayments of 700 mln
riyals of debt to some 50 Saudi and international banks.
    Bankers said the deal for the Jeddah-based heavy equipment
importer is likely to set a precedent for the private sector.
It was greeted with relief after 18 months of negotiations.
    AAA's rescheduling has been followed in the last few days
by a draft accord on the 1.3 billion riyal debt of one of the
Kingdom's most publicised companies, &lt;Saudi Research and
Development Corp>, REDEC. These two cases have raised hopes
that other companies will also reach agreement soon.
    Bankers said the cement importer &lt;Arabian Bulk Trade>, and
the construction and trading firm &lt;Ali and Fahd Shobokshi
Group> are still negotiating with creditor banks.
    They are increasingly resigned to there being little legal
recourse in Saudi Arabia, and that rescheduling with payments
geared to a company's cash-flow -- often very low -- is the
only way to recover at least a portion of outstanding loans.
    Though bankers feel they generally have the tacit backing
of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Kingdom's
central bank, some say it should take a more active role.
    However, bankers said it is encouraging SAMA has not
blocked a "black list" of borrowers banks have drawn up and
circulated for over a year.
    Bankers said the AAA accord, negotiated by a committee led
by &lt;Saudi British Bank>, is a likely model in that banks have
not insisted on full repayment of all obligations.
    Sixty pct of the debt will be repaid in monthly instalments
over seven years at 1/4 point over Bahrain interbank offered
rates (BIBOR). The remaining 40 pct is only to be paid after
completion of the first tranche, also at 1/4 over BIBOR. And
accrued interest on the 40 pct will be waived as long as the
first tranche is met in full.
    As one banker put it, "Many banks took the view it was
better to get some money back rather than none at all."

<TITLE>LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY'S S. AFRICA BAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's parliament has approved an
extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a
key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on
Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.
    The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late
September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.
    Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on
Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception
for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As
oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the
door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.
    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct
of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade
has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,
trade ministry officials said.
    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South
Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight
months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns
from the year-ago figure.
    The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for
formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.

<TITLE>STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strikes against a government freeze on
wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the
official news agency Tanjug said last night.
    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials
feared more strikes were on the way.
    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in
the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were
in the northern republic of Croatia.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last
month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an
annual rate of almost 100 pct.
    The government froze wages at their level in the fourth
quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to
productivity.
    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior
executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the
freeze in interviews with Tanjug.
    The agency said strikes took place last week in the
southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia
and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in
Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.

<TITLE>DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,
and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan
takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris
accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.
    "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of
150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealer
at one leading bank said.
    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at
around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a
meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.
    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,
but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed
inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.
    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package
Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its
trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would
probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.
    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of
measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost
domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.
    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition
boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition
of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim
chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near
future, the dealers said.
    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the
U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on
the dollar, they said.
    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed
since before the Paris accord, they added.
    "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to
a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt
crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest
payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the
Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms
scandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.
    "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to
around 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical Bank
Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.
    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way
for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.
    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.
Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for
quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar
when it rose to 1.87 marks.
    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London
when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.
    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central
bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline
because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying
intervention as a chance to sell dollars.
    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch
assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will not
show drastic movement at least to the end of March."
    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any
strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books
for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar
would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on
their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any
comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.

<TITLE>ORION ROYAL WITHDRAWS FROM FRN MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Orion Royal Bank has decided to withdraw
from making markets in floating rate notes (FRNs), an official
of Orion said.
    He said the decision to withdraw was made about 11 days ago
before the market was battered by a loss of confidence, which
resulted in sizeable losses in these securities.
    The official, who declined to be identified, said Orion,
the merchant banking arm of Royal Bank of Canada, had operated
profitably in the market from 1984 to date. However, the
decline in the market made it appear that they could no longer
justify the overhead.
    The official said Orion would redeploy the three traders
who had been in the FRN sector, mostly to their Euro-commercial
paper operation, an area the bank believes has a greater growth
potential.
    Officials at several other firms, who also declined to be
identified, said they were reviewing their position to decide
whether to continue making markets in FRNs.
    In trading earlier today, traders said prices of several
dated FRNs had firmed slightly and that some buyers were
beginning to re-enter the market.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK EXPECTED TO APPROVE PHILIPPINES LOAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank is expected to approve a
310 mln dlr economic recovery loan for the Philippines at a
meeting of its executive board today in Washington, Central
Bank sources said.
    The sources said the loan, agreed upon in principle last
September during a visit to the United States by President
Corazon Aquino, had been held up by Philippine government
delays in fulfilling key conditions.
    They said the documents required by the World Bank were not
submitted by Manila until late February.
    The sources said the loan is needed to rehabilitate the the
state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP), which together are burdened with
seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.
    They said the World Bank had insisted the two banks appoint
independent auditors and draft revised charters.
    It also laid down several conditions for an Asset
Privatisation Trust (APT) planned by the government to dispose
of the banks' unproductive assets, the sources said.
    The APT, set up in January, is headed by banker and
businessman David SyCip.
    The sources said the World Bank wanted respected private
sector individuals to be appointed to the APT, and immunity
from prosecution for the trust. It wanted a clause saying
buyers of non-performing assets could not be prosecuted.
    The Manila Standard newspaper quoted Rolando Arrivillaga,
World Bank representative in the Philippines, as saying the
loan would be in three 100 mln dlr tranches. The first tranche
would be available late this month or in early April.
    Arrivillaga said the remaining 10 mln dlrs was in the form
of technical assistance available for disbursement during a
36-month period.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said approval of the
loan will trigger another 300 mln dlr loan expected from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan.
    The Central Bank sources said negotiations would start in
April on another 150 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to
implement reforms in the government corporate sector.
    The sources said the World Bank is expected to approve the
loan by August, after a review of the government's
non-financial institutions. The government's 14 major
corporations rely heavily on budgetary support to supplement
external borrowing to meet their yearly revenue shortfalls.

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS NO INTENTION TO ALTER SALES TAX BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he
had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill
introducing a sales tax.
    "Parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before
we see whether to revise it or not," Miyazawa told reporters.
    He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier
Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax.
    The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed
yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as
he saw growing public opposition.
    Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic
opposition boycott over their objections to the tax.
    Miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even
after Parliament completes its deliberations. He also said the
Government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional
budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1.
    The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press
speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than
1,000 billion yen.

<TITLE>CREDITORS/DEBTORS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY-WEIZSAECKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker said both debtor and creditor nations share
responsibility for the Third World's foreign debt crisis.
    Weizsaecker, in a speech on the first day of an official
visit to Argentina, said: "Debtor and creditor countries have
created this situation jointly. They also share responsibility
for finding lasting solutions."
    Local officials have payed great importance to
Weizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer of
more flexible repayment terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr
foreign debt, Latin America's third largest.
    Weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him by
President Raul Alfonsin at Buenos Aires' City Council hall,
also said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacle
posed by the foreign debt to countries like Argentina.
    "Democracy in Latin America must not be endangered because
of misery or new injustices," he said.
    Argentine officials said they might halt debt payments last
month if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlr
loan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11
banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure
the loan.
    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with the
European Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain
exports.
    "We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of
balanced interest from all parties," he said.
    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly
into the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.
    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a Latin
American tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala. He held
brief talks on Sunday with Brazilian President Jose Sarney
during a stopover in Brasilia.

Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>, could start by late 1988 or
early 1989, West German Technology Minister Heinz Riesenhuber

    Companies in the United States and Japan say they already

    Siemens and Philips, together with the West German and
Dutch governments, have invested a total of 1.4 billion marks
in researching and developing the chip.
    Representatives of the two companies said the sophisticated
technology could be used to produce cheaper medical diagnosis
instruments and to regulate car fuel consumption and emissions.

International Metals B.V.>, the Dutch mining company, has urged
Surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on
bauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.
    He told Reuters that Billiton, a fully-owned Royal
Dutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS> subsidiary, presented the demands to Henk
Heidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi
Bouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for official
talks.
    Billiton and &lt;Suralco>, owned by U.S. Conglomerate Alcoa
&lt;AA.S>, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfare
contributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.
    The two firms are the biggest private sector employers in
Surinam. Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety
of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla
group, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July
1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.
    High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have
been cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.
    "We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can't
expect any company to remain operating with losses," the
spokesman said.

under 1.81 mln in both January and December.
    "The level of housing starts is likely to have declined
modestly but still have remained at a relatively high level,"
said Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc.
    Unfortunately, meaningful comparisons between February's
and prior months' underlying trends may prove difficult.
    "Caution should be used when interpreting (December's and
January's) increase," cautioned Smith Barney's Greenbaum.
    "Although underlying fundamentals remain strong -- mortgage
rate stability, healthy income gains -- warmer than usual
weather undoubtedly also had some influence in pushing starts
higher in both months," he added.
    Economists at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc were more
succinct in a weekly newsletter: "a slight decline across the
board, no particular economic reason, mostly weather."
    Charles Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp
said single-family homes would account for most of the housing
starts drop although Smith Barney's Greenbaum saw signs of
stabilization in both the single- and multi-family sectors.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker is also due to appear
before a Congressional committee Tuesday morning.
    Federal funds are expected to open at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct
after being quoted at 6-3/16 late yesterday.
    U.S. government securities prices continued to drift
aimlessly yesterday, with the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury
bond closing 7/32 lower at 99-25/32.

<TITLE>DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Employers in Rotterdam's troubled
general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy
procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour
relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.
    Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the
employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption
of eight weeks of strikes in the sector.
    The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim
court injunction against the employers' plans for 350
redundancies this year.
    A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made
an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission
for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a
final ruling on May 7.
    Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well
take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared
simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the
chance they would have to start all over again in any case.
    "We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The
strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,
and further delays would do even more damage," Zeebregts said.
    The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general
cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans
for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce
by 1990, starting with 350 this year.

<TITLE>POINDEXTER MAY GET IMMUNITY TO HELP TRACK FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional investigators
tentatively plan to grant immunity to former presidential
National Security Advisor John Poindexter who they say may help
track missing money from Iran arms sales.
    Congressional sources told Reuters the House of
Representatives and Senate committees probing the arms scandal
are expected to back a preliminary accord reached last Friday
by their legal advisors to grant Poindexter immunity from
prosecution in return for his testimony. He would be the first
leading figure in the affair to be granted immunity.
    Poindexter resigned from his White House post in November
when it was divulged that up to 30 mln dlrs in arms sales
profits might have been diverted to Nicaraguan contra rebels.
Congressional investigators and a presidential review
commission have not tracked beyond secret Swiss and Cayman
Island bank accounts mlns of dlrs said to have been diverted.
    The sources said Poindexter could help trace the money,
which is one of the big riddles of the scandal. "Obviously we
think he is a very important witness," said a House source.
    Poindexter has refused to testify before Congress, citing
his constitutional rights against self-incrimination.

<TITLE>ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Japanese economy will remain sluggish
in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for
12 years in 1986, private economists said.
    Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,
was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and
business investment would help sustain the economy this year,
the economists said.
    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency
report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec
quarter for the first time in 12 years.
    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real
0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the
previous quarter.
    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from
4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst
performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake
of the first oil crisis.
    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in
consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was
only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had
depressed retail sales.
    But most private economists disagreed and said consumers
were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw
their real income level off.
    "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or
heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but
they have done so because they have become even more uneasy
about their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general manager
of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.
    He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of
 falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit
hard by the yen's rise.
    Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said
weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.
Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve
domestically generated economic growth as the government has
put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.
    Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in
Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including
exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen
Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,
said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec
resulted from an issue of gold coins.
    "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that
high level of public-sector consumption in the following
quarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending
would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which
marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.
    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current
quarter given the lack of additional significant government
spending and sluggish consumer spending.
    Saito said the most effective government action would be
income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a
proposed controversial sales tax.

<TITLE>U.K. BUDGET HOPES BOOSTED BY PSBR DATA - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Data on the U.K.'s public sector
borrowing requirement has boosted hopes of a large fiscal
adjustment for the coming financial year, broking and banking
analysts said.
    Some analysts say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson may announce this afternoon a total of up to six
billion stg in tax cuts and lower government borrowing targets.
    Total PSBR in the first 11 months of the fiscal year of 100
mln stg compares with a projected seven billion. Forecasts had
generally been for a net repayment in February, but the 300 mln
stg repayment was toward the better end of expectations.
    March is usually a high-spending month, boosting the 11
month figure at the end of the fiscal year. Nevertheless,
Lawson is expected to downwardly revise the 1986/87 PSBR later
today.
    Until now, only the more optimistic forecasts put Lawson's
room for manoeuvre as great as six billion stg for 1987/88,
with many favouring a four billion of five billion package.
    But Bill Martin, economist at brokers Phillips and Drew,
said a six billion stg adjustment now looks within range, split
between three billion off the PSBR and three billion off taxes.
    Malcolm Roberts, of Salomon Bros International, also said
six billion was within a credible range of forecasts.
    Roberts added that he was now expecting Lawson to have at
least five billion stg available following this morning's data,
against his own previous estimates of around four billion.
    He said today's 11 month PSBR figure was genuinely low,
rather than distorted by unusual factors, which fuels pressure
on Lawson to reduce next year's borrowing target. However, he
forecast a March 1987 PSBR of 3.5 billion stg.
    Peter Fellner, of brokers James Capel, cautioned that six
billion still looks on the high side of expectations.
    "Something like 4.5 (billion) or so is still more realistic,"
he said.

units in January.
    Permits for single-family houses fell in January by 6.6 pct
to 1,091,000.
    The number of permits for multi-family houses fell in
February by 11.7 pct to 529,000 units after falling in January
by 19.3 pct, the department said.
    Housing starts in February included a seasonally adjusted
5.6 pct rise in single family units to 1,317,000 units and a
4.1 pct fall in multi-family homes to 534,000 units.
    The seasonally adjusted permits total in February for
single family units was 1,235,000 and for multi-family units
was 529,000 units.

<TITLE>SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Production of fish meal by the three
South American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- last
year reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of
1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers
(IAFMM) said.
    However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean
and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987
to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last
quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for
the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru
in the same month.
    The statement added that, due to technical market promotion
and energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position at
the end of the year remained reasonable.
    Fish meal production outside South America decreased
slightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.
    The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West
Germany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the Far
East, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K.
    It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from
competition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmed
milk powder in the U.K.
    IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producing
nations, in thousands of tonnes, were -

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Copper shares, which have lagged
behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger
demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.
    "Copper prices should move up over the next four to six
quarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. "I
see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from
around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world
economic growth."
    Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a
pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.
    Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong
performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.
    But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from
copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential
winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its
copper operations to its shareholders.
    "In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play
and benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.
    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,
said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining
operations. "They've accomplished a great deal," he said.
    The company's move into carbon black, a product used in
tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid
growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.
He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs
in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.
    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.
    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and
four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this
year and around 3.50 dlrs next year.
    "The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from its
current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.
    "Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need
copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," said
Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares will
outperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.
    But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says
Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. "We'd rather
place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a
significant premium to the current stock price," he said.
    After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will
have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co
&lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,
Toufexis noted.
    Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in
1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40
dlrs from operations in 1986.
    "I'd be buying up to 90," Toufexis said last week, when the
stock rose sharply to near that level. "But the shares are
probably worth about 108 dlrs (each)."
    Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like
Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison
sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses
in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and
from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.
    Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co
&lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in
coal and other minerals aside from copper.
    But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced
at current levels. "I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy
Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock," he said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. BANKING REGULATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Barry, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. banks are under pressure to
meet vigorous competition, but Congress continues to duck hard
choices on banking law reform that could benefit consumers.
    Supporters say deregulating banking will increase
competition, offer consumers more choices and bring lower fees
for financial services and home mortgage interest rates.
    But the Senate Banking Committee last week put off until
later in the year decisions on pressing issues such as whether
banks could enter new businesses like underwriting corporate
debt and selling insurance and real estate.
    The committee also reined in banks' competitors, the
so-called nonbank banks, which elude the technical definition
of a bank because they do not both accept deposits and make
loans. The committee meeting room became a battleground for
giants of the financial industry -- banks, brokerages,
insurance firms, retail and industrial corporations -- with but
little consideration given to the consumer.
    The lobbies backed various amendments to protect their turf
and a bill that rescues a federal deposit insurance fund for
thrift institutions and puts a moratorium on any changes in
banking law was passed and sent on to the full Senate.
    The House of Representatives has yet to act.
    Behind the political deals was the larger question whether
Congress would end or modify the half-century-old separation of
commercial and investment banking or leave it alone.
    One argument in support of change is that fees for
financial services would come down if Congress expands banks'
powers.
    Lower fees to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, for
example, could lead to lower interest rates on home mortgages,
supporters say.
    "A lot of nonbanking firms have used loopholes to get into
banking, but banks have not be allowed into any new businesses,"
says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.
    "We have been seeing a gigantic turf war," says Litan, who
favors new powers for banks if deposits are safeguarded.
    The swirl of corporate mergers and the financial
information explosion have blurred the distinction between the
activities of banks and security brokerages.
    On a wider horizon, U.S. financial institutions face
stepped-up competition from financial centers like London and
Tokyo in international transactions.
    West German and Japanese banking is more concentrated in a
few, large banks, while most European countries allow banking
and securities to be mixed.
    All these forces put pressure on U.S. financial firms to
adapt to change, but the congressional debate over reform drags
on. The committee's bill put a freeze on any changes and its
chairman, Senator William Proxmire, promised to return the
issues in October. If approved by Congress, the bill would
postpone applications before the Federal Reserve for new powers
to three of the largest banks -- Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and
Bankers Trust.
    Other industries where regulatory barriers have fallen have
experienced lower fees, the emergence of new players and
accelerated innovation.
    But these advances in airlines, trucking, and
telecommunications have not been without drawbacks. Companies
that were slow to adapt disappeared under the new competitive
regime, while the public faced a bewildering number of new
choices. The Reagan administration favors bank reform.
    The traditional method companies use to raise funds --
borrowing from banks -- has given way to selling corporate debt
and other new securities that are off limits to banks.
    But critics say the soundness of the banking system created
by such laws as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act would be
undermined.
    Banks are treated as special and shielded from the
marketplace's vagaries by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) performs
the same function for thrifts.
    The one issue the committee did act on which benefits
consumers is new funding for the federal insurance fund for
deposits at savings and loan associations, which has fallen to
its lowest ratio of reserves to deposits in history.
    Despite efforts toward change in Congress, a ban on
interstate banking remains.
    The barriers are crumbling anyway because state
legislatures are agreeing to permit bank mergers across state
lines within a region.
    Congress is proceeding cautiously, having in mind the
banking industry's tribulations in the early 1930's.
    But some say it is moving too cautiously for banks to keep
pace with what is happening in business here and around the
world.

<TITLE>GUYANA PRESIDENT CALLS POISON SCARE "MISCHIEVOUS"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GEORGETOWN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Desmond Hoyte said recent
reports of widespread thallium sulphate poisoning in Guyana
were mischievous and had gravely damaged the country's food
exports.
    "There is no thallium sulphate poisoning epidemic in Guyana,
as has been rumored," Hoyte said in a radio address late Sunday.
    Reports of a spate of poisonings from the chemical had led
some newspapers in the Caribbean to call for a ban on food
exports from Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had restricted
imports of Guyanese rice, Hoyte said.
    Thallium sulphate, banned in many countries and blacklisted
since 1973 by the World Health Organization as a deadly
chemical, has been used by Guyana's state sugar corporation as
a rodent poison.
    Calling the reports a "mischievous invention," Hoyte said
tests had shown some of Guyana's main exports, such as wheat
and flour, were not contaminated.
    Hoyte based his statements on tests conducted by the WHO
and the Pan American Health Organization, which found only
seven cases of thallium sulphate poisoning thus far.

<TITLE>EC WARNS U.S. AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) yesterday
warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,
that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations
with both countries.
    EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's
continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make
a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they
were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that
would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were
prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already
distanced itself from the bill.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written
to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
outlining the EC's concerns.
    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.
Moves towards protectionism. "The adoption of such measures
would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of
multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral
relations," it said.
    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but
to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, it said.
    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."
    The statement said the EC would continue to insist that
Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.
    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a
report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them
to take appropriate action where necessary.
    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It will
be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said.
    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,
"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the
Community concerning trade relations with Japan."
    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo
to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and
damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more
cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

<TITLE>RENEWED BULL SPREADING LIKELY ON CATTLE REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Livestock analysts expect renewed bull
spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA
7-state cattle on feed report.
    The USDA reported high placements in February, which may
weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued
strong marketings during the month will support the April
contract.
    Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50
cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts
said.
    Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle
on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom
O'Hare. "They have no place to send the grain," he said.
    Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while
the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may
offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.
    "The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,"
said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that
even though placements came in above the average trade guess,
many traders had expected high placements.
    Placements are not that negative, especially since the
technical correction in June and August live cattle futures
since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.
    He said the current marketing posture will provide added
support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been
running at a heavier than expected pace.
    Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with
the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of
the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But
the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year
ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.
    "So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They
(feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had
intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish
development," Levitt said.
    Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of
March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling
behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan told the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year import
diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade
governing body, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
    The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT
questionnaire on unfair trade practices, the spokesman said.
    In the five-year plan, which starts this year, South Korea
aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported
goods and to increase imports from the U.S. And Europe.
    Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral
negotiations on the plan, the spokesman said. "The notification
does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint, nor
is it intended to pressure South Korea. It is a routine
procedure followed by all other GATT member states."

<TITLE>LUFTHANSA SAYS FARE POLICY IN LINE WITH EC RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German airline, Deutsche
Lufthansa AG, believes the way it decides fares is in line with
European Community (EC) guidelines despite an official probe, a
company spokesman said today.
    The Federal Cartel Office in West Berlin is investigating
whether agreements reached by European airlines over fares are
a breach of EC regulations on competition.
    Hubertus Schoen, the Cartel Office's spokesman, said the
investigation had been running for some weeks.
    A spokesman for Lufthansa told Reuters: "Lufthansa presumes
that the way we decide fares corresponds with EC regulations."
    Airlines did not traditionally have to comply with a clause
in the Community's treaty forbidding companies in member states
from reaching accords likely to hinder free competition.
    However, Schoen said that last year the European Court of
Justice had ruled that this clause should also apply to air
traffic. The Cartel Office"s probe came in the wake of this.
    The Office had not yet officially contacted Lufthansa, but
Schoen said the airline would be asked for information about
the way fares were decided.
    It would then be decided if the practice was a breach of
article 85 of the EC treaty.

<TITLE>NO MAJOR FARM POLICY CHANGES THIS YEAR - DOLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>There will be no significant changes
in U.S. agricultural policy this year, said Senate Minority
leader Robert Dole (R-Kan).
    Speaking at the annual convention of National Grain and
Feed Association, Dole said that while the current farm bill is
not perfect, "I still believe it is a step in the right
direction."
    Dole said he would like to reduce the costs of the program
but that expenditures will continue to be high until the U.S.
becomes more aggressive in its export policy through either the
broader use of the Export Enhancement Program or the
implementation of a market loan for wheat and feed grains.
    Commenting on whether the U.S. should offer the Soviet
Union subsidized grain, Dole said, "If your going to trade with
the Soviet Union you have to be competitive."
    He said one way to get around the problem of making direct
subsidies to the Soviets would be to implement a market loan,
which he said would make U.S. commodity prices competitive.
    Prospects for passage of mandatory production controls,
specifically the Harkin-Gephardt mandatory bill, are not good,
he said. "Mandatory has less support now than it did a year ago
and it will have even less support when people understand it,"
he said.
    If the House passes a pending 0/92 bill for 1987 winter
wheat, the Senate will try to address 0/92 for a one year
period, Dole added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING UNIMPORTANT - PREMIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said
the downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by the U.S. Standard
and Poor's Corp was regrettable but of little practical
importance.
    3tandard and Poor's yesterday lowered the rating on Danish
long-term external debt to AA from AA-plus, saying Denmark was
less competitive with rising labour costs and this would worsen
the external account deficit and increase external debt.
    Schlueter told journalists after the weekly cabinet
meeting: "It is regrettable that they have taken a plus from us,
but the change will not have much practical significance."
    He was echoing comments by central bank governor Erik
Hoffmeyer, who was quoted by the daily Politiken as saying the
downgrading would have little effect on Denmark's borrowing
capability or the interest it paid on loans.
    But some bank economists said the lower rating would
increase the cost of national borrowing to finance the external
current account deficit, which rose to a record 34.5 billion
crowns in 1986.
    Denmark had total foreign debt of over 260 mln crowns at
the end of 1986.
    Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said in a statement last
night that the downgrading, the second in four years, should
not be over-dramatised, pointing out that the government had
already imposed a series of austerity measures to limit
consumption and was willing to act again if necessary.
    Prices fell steeply when the Danish bond market opened but
recovered somewhat after the central bank cut the overnight
money market lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.
    The bank said the cut was due to an inflow of foreign
currency in March, following stabler currency relations after
January's EMS realignment.

<TITLE>U.S. CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT 36.84 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. current account deficit
widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments
basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a
revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit
was 36.28 billion dlrs.
    For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad
measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57
billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.
    The department said an increase in the merchandise trade
deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from
37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for
the worsening deficit.
    Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the
final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    The current account includes trade in merchandise and
services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest
of the world.
    The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all
of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986,
compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.
    Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last
year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down
to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter
because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.
    Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3
billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1
billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs
after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth
quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and
strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.
    Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners
were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln
dlrs in the third quarter.
    Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S.
Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion
dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding
U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs,
surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.
   Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth
quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr
third-quarter increase.
    U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs
from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp
selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.
    Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7
billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    Foreign direct investment in the United States increased
14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6
billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up
acquisitions, the department said.
    Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800
mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion
dlrs in the third quarter.
    For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4
billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as
foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange
markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EAST GERMANY ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC REFORM PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EAST BERLIN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>East Germany plans to devolve more
responsibility to factories and boost profitability under a law
obliging plants to generate their own funds for investments in
new machinery, repairs or expansion, the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper said.
    The state would no longer finance projects under five mln
marks under the law which took effect on January 1.
    The paper also hinted at further, more ambitious changes if
this experiment proved successful.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has cited East Germany's
cautious industrial decentralisation as an alternative to the
Hungarian model based on Western-style market economics.
    The law stresses that East Germany remains committed to the
centralised state-planned economic system with no market
experiments.
    "This new regulation is part of our general investment
policy," Berliner Zeitung said, citing the growing importance of
robots and high technology rather than the large-scale plant
construction of the 1950s and 1960s.
    "This step could be the start of even greater changes in GDR
investment policy. We must wait and see," it added.
    Factory investment funds would be drawn from profits above
certain minimum returns pledged to the state under annual plans
and from amortisation -- funds the factory is allowed to keep
to compensate for depreciation in the cost of machinery.
    Amortisation costs and all profits currently go back to the
state, which provides all investment capital in return.
    This centralisation has hindered management's response to
changes in world markets vital for the East German economy,
economists said.

<TITLE>BAKER URGES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker urged
Congress to support the administration's financing requests for
the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal
years.
    Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the
administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal
1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill
Washington's annual payment responsibilities.
    In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his
remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago, Baker said
support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership.
    Baker told the committee, "Our national self respect and
our international leadership depend on our willingness to
fulfill this responsibility."
    The administration budget requests include a supplemental
request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr
request for fiscal 1988.
    Baker noted these requests included funding requirements
negotiated by the administration with this committee.
    Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were
formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them.
    Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms
in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in
others aimed at making them more efficient, with policies
oriented toward free markets.
    He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on
the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued
financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in
resolving the debt crisis.
    In other remarks, Baker repeated the need to finance the
general foreign affairs budget and underscored how MDBs have
served U.S. national interests.

charges they misrepresented the amount of down filling in coats
they sold.
    The FTC said Sears and Kellwood also pledged to make
truthful advertising claims about the down and feather content
of their garments and to accurately disclose the type of
filling on the garments' labels.
    The FTC said Kellwood has not made or sold any down
garments since 1983.
    The FTC had charged in a 1981 complaint filed in federal
court that Sears and Kellwood mislabeled and falsely advertised
the down content of clothing made by Kellwood and sold by both
Sears and Kellwood.
    As is typical in such cases, the settlement terms did not
require either company to admit or deny the charges.
    The FTC vote to accept the settlement was 4-1.
    In a dissent, Commissioner Andrew Strenio argued that the
settlement terms held Sears to a lower standard than the rest
of the clothing industry.

owned by Varity Corp, said it shipped 48 large conventional
combines valued at nearly five mln Canadian dlrs to its Saudi
Arabian distributor, located in Riyadh.
    Massey Combines said the combines shipment is the company's
first major sale in Saudi Arabia since the sharp drop in world
oil prices forced many oil-producing countries to curb
machinery imports.
    Massey Combines, formerly Varity's combines division,
became an independent business during a company restructuring

<TITLE>DUTCH OFFICIAL WARNS OF MORE TRADE CONFLICTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Already strained relations between
the U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get
worse before they get better, director general of the Dutch
Economics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engering
said.
    Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The
Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over
steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.
    "I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus
ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous
provocation," he said. "I feel that we shall probably have to
deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future."
    Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get
the American balance of payments into better shape, but the
risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has
its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering
noted.
    "If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that
we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,
then I think the answer is probably yes," he said.
    In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the
EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration
will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and
pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

<TITLE>NASD PROPOSES EQUAL SHARE VOTES WITH VARIATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc said its board of governors has proposed
adoption of uniform rules by major U.S. stock markets which
would emphasize equal shareholder voting rights but allow for
legitimate variations.
    The NASD said its proposal would eliminate differences in
stockholder voting standards as a competitive factor between
markets. It called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to
adopt such a rule applying to all markets if each equity market
is unwilling to voluntarily adopt a uniform rule under the
commission's guidence.
    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to"
voluntarily adopt a uniform rule such as it is proposing, NASD
President Gordon S. Macklin said in a letter to SEC Chairman
John S.R. Shad.
    The NASD said its view is based on the association's study
of the issue and from information developed at the SEC's
recently concluded hearings on the subject.
    The current discussion of the one share-one vote issue was
triggered by the New York Stock Exchange's application to the
SEC for permission to abandon the standard with respect to
companies listed on the NYSE, the NASD noted.
    It called for limiting variations of equal voting rights to
situations involving complete disclosure such as - 
    (1) shares in a registerd public offering where all facts
connected with the company's capital structure are clearly
spelled out in the prospectus and - 
    (2) shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition
or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied
by detailed proxy material.
    The NASD said the uniform rule should be written to
disallow the issuance of dual classes of shares where those
with superior voting rights are not resalable.

<TITLE>REAGAN TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, ending four months
of semi-isolation from the press, will hold a televised news
conference on Thursday, the White House said.
    Reagan is certain to be questioned extensively at the 2000
EST/0100 gmt session about the secret sale of arms to Iran and
skimming of profits to aid U.S.-backed "contra" rebels in
Nicaragua.
    During his last news conference on November 19, 1986 -- six
days before the fund diversion came to light -- Reagan strongly
defended the clandestine arms operation.
    During that session, the president also denied any third
country involvement in the Iran initiative even though it was
already known that Israel had played a key role in the arms
shipments. The White House was forced to issue a correction
following the news conference.
    Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter with
reporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his job
approval rating in various public opinion polls.
    Since the November 19 news conference, Reagan --who
maintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- has
revised his position on his covert Iran policy.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY ANNOUNCES OECD TIED-AID PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said an agreement has been reached by members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to
control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote
trade.
    He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan
administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export
credit subsidies.
    The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed
credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs
and lost exports, the Treasury said.
    The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988
would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and
place limits on permitted aid by developing countries.
    It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid
and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor
countries, the Treasury said.
    Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on
Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a
demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take
concrete steps to resolve important trade issues.

<TITLE>SOVIETS SAID TO SEE NEW FLOOR FOR GRAIN OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The intensive technology concept for
grain production has put a new floor under USSR grain
production, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Moscow
said in a field report.
    The report, quoting a broadcast on Radio Moscow, said that
due to intensive technology grain production in a "bad year" will
not fall below 200 mln tonnes, and in a "good year" grain
production could reach 250 mln tonnes.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department currently forecasts this
year's USSR crop at 210.1 mln tonnes, and if realized this
would be the third year since 1975 that the Soviet Union's
grain harvest has exceeded 200.0 mln tonnes.
    The largest crop since 1975 was 237.4 mln tonnes harvested
in 1978, according to USDA data.

<TITLE>OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS BANK LOANS TOO SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker,
while defending the progress of his 1985 debt initiative,
conceded that lending by commercial banks to developing
countries has not gone as fast as the administration would have
liked.
    In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said, however, "I think it is wrong to say that
(commercial bank lending) has not occured in a meaningful way."
    He added though that it has not "materialized as fast as we
would have liked."
    The Treasury secretary also said that it would be
politically wrong for the United States or other countries to
guarantee loans made by commercial banks to the developing
country debtors because that would be "rightly perceived as a
bank bailout."
    Baker also said that it would be impractical for
governments to mandate bank lending to the third world since
this would have the eventual impact of turning commercial banks
away from making all loans to the region.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986.
    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this
year, Lawson said.
    "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may
continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by
the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year," he added.
    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),
Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0
billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.
    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for
the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal
1987/88.
    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3
aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be taken
into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course
will the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament.
    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "is
chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax
revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an
increasingly profitable business sector in particular."
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987.
    He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax
revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the
economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the
public finances in a very strong position."
    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at
1.0 pct of GDP in future.
    "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term
Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0
pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years
ahead," Lawson said.
    "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this
year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course
remains a major objective of government policy."
    "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence
and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."
    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange
Control Act from the Statute book.
    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged
at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be
charged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate."
    He said that under the new proposed system, companies
should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments
against tax on capital gains.
    "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in
1988/89," Lawson said.
    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building
societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation
tax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after
the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."
    "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new
method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and
File."
    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax
collection, and would not come into force until the early
1990s.
    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax
(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct
of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their
(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those
new fields exceeds the costs incurred.
    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending
on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any
particular field.
    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive
tax relief for retraining workers.
    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value
Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax
on the basis of cash paid and received.
    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of
quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being
extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds
are to be raised to 21,300 stg.
    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.
    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be
set at 125,000 stg.
    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies
in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be
able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.
The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuine
trading companies" will not be affected.
    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit
relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank
loans, also from April 1.
    "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit
only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said.
    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two
pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.
    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic
taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decision
to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to
reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."
    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to
27 pct, he said.
    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to
change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it
into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities
made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable
provisions made by financial traders.
    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with
Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.
    "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the
Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawson
said.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE PREDICTS SOLID U.S. HOUSING GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
predicted 1987 will be the fifth successive year for growth in
housing starts after a 2.6 pct rise overall in February starts
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units.
    "This year should be the fifth solid year in a row for
homebuilding activity -- with single-family units stronger than
multi-family units," he said in a statement.

5.6 pct to 1.317 mln units on a seasonally adjusted basis while
