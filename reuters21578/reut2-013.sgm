<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/COMPAQ COMPUTER &lt;CPQ></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Compaq Computer Corp, IBM's chief
rival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain on
Wall Street today. Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 on
volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that the
damage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less than
expected." He said Compaq's stock had been under pressure
recently because of anticipation of IBM's unveiling of a new
line of personal computers.
    International Business Machines &lt;IBM> introduced four new
personal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products.
But analysts said the new computers, though they do contain a
lot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy as
some other PC makers had feared.
    "The long range issue here is who wins and who loses in the
PC business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and is
unlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst Mark Stahlman of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co said.
    Stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of Compaq and Apple
Computer Inc &lt;AAPL>.
    Stahlman said "The critical investment question now is who
will have a pickup in sales in the near term. We expect to see
a strong demand setting for PCs for the rest of this year, and
that will boost the revenues for all of the major PC vendors."
    "The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period on
record for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don't
think the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon."
    "In anticipating the IBM announcement, Compaq has made
pricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediate
purposes," he said.

<TITLE>NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Murdochville, Quebec, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said
production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper
mine here until it can completely examine the mine.
    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others
underground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought
safely out of the mine.
    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more
specific.
    Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to
operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric
tons annual finished capacity.
    The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,
Coffin said.
    Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would
take four or five months before it could resume full
production.

<TITLE>FHLBB SAYS MORTGAGE RATES CONTINUE DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said
home mortgage rates fell from early February to early March to
their lowest point in nine years, but the rate of decline was
slower than it had been in recent months.
    The bank board said the average effective commitment rate
for fixed-rate mortgages for single family homes and a 25 pct
loan-to-price ratio with a maturity of at least 15 years was
9.48 pct in early March.
    The rate was four basis points lower than a month ago, only
one-eighth the size of decline in the previous month, the bank
board said.
    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages decline eight basis
points from early February to 8.43 pct in early March, the bank
board said. The drop was far less than the 15 basis point
decline in the previous period, the agency said.
    The average effective interest rate on all loans closed by
major mortgage lenders declined nine basis points from early
February to early March, the agency said. The fall brought the
rate to 9.14 pct was the lowest since December 1977, it said.
    The effective rate for ARMS was 8.39 pct, 15 basis points
below a month earlier. For fixed-rate loans it was 9.36 pct, 14
basis points below a month earlier, the agency said.

<TITLE>LARGER VOLUME SEEN ON EUROPEAN OPTIONS EXCHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>European options exchanges will see
spectacular growth over the next five years as more
professional investors discover the options markets, Bernard
Reed, manager of the London options exchange said.
    At an options outlook seminar to mark tomorrow's official
opening of a new Amsterdam options exchange (EOE) building, he
forecast increasing interest from banks and institutional
investors, using options for portfolio insurance.
    "But the dominance by the professionals should not make us
neglect private clients," he noted. "Successful exploitation of
retail business has been one of the keys to success."
    Reed said derived option products in particular will become
a popular instrument for managing equity risks. On the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the cash-settled S&amp;P 100 index
option is the most traded in the world.
    Dutch Stock Index Fund options to be relaunched on May 18
and the upcoming options on London's FTSE 100 index will see a
30 pct yearly turnover growth until 1990, Reed estimated.
    The CBOE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have agreed
with Morgan Stanley to trade options and futures on the capital
international EAFE index which will let investors participate
in worldwide market moves.
    Reed said he did not believe in globalising the option
business by introducing international products, because this
would intensify competition among the exchanges, but he did see
a future for global rules and regulations.

<TITLE>UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, MD., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Food And Commercial
Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the
union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters
protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of
Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>.
    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and
also owns Rickels home centers.
    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid
because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the
current takeover mania."
    A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our
members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives
and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."
    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which
last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.
The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in
profits, analysts estimate.
    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major
restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and
caused a loss of thousands of jobs.

<DATELINE>    TEMPE, Ariz., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>FCS Laboratories Inc said merger
discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the
health care field have ended without an agreement.
    The previously announced negotiations began last August,
the company said.
    "It's disappointing to spend so much time on these
negotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman Nicholas
Gallo III. "But the discussions could not produce a deal
acceptable to our board in the context of the company's
stronger financial position today as compared to six months
ago."
    Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger
partners, but will respond to serious inquiries.
    "We are determined to follow our plan to restore this
company to profitability," he said. "To continue actively
searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to
postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are
part of the plan."
    The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,
reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of
the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.

<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Burlington Northern Inc said its
Burlington Northern Railroad Co unit reached an agreement in
principle to settle a class action lawsuit filed against the
company in May 1985 by holders of two series of the company's
bonds.
    It said the settlement arrangement calls for the company to
establish a cash settlement fund of 35.5 mln dlrs, which would
be distributed to the bondholders after deductions for
attorney's fees.
    The lawsuit, filed by holders of its four pct Prior Lien
bonds due January 1, 1997 and its three pct General Lien Bonds
due January 1, 2047, sought to prevent the release of
collateral, the company said.
    If the settlement agreement is approved, the trading prices
of the bonds will decline substantially because they will no
longer reflect the speculative premiums at which the bonds
currently trade, Burlington Northern also said.
    It said the settlement is subject to negotiation by
Burlington Northern, the Citibank N.A. unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>
and Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, the bonds' trustees.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.
    Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role
in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless
Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for
Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside
competition.
    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of
attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sure
it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of
Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a
personal interest in this problem.
    "I don't understand it to be closed at all."
    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be
"talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what
they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very
serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not
as free as we allow access to our markets to be."
    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain
could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance
institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar
treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.
    "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,"
Howard added.
    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,
and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.
    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any
significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese
telecommunications industry.
    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined
again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.
This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul
Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.
    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain
believed a "sensible solution" could be found which would open
Japanese markets to British goods.
    Government officials were at pains today to deny that
Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise
similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial
firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.
    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials
had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial
institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not
necessarily constitute a deadline.
    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against
Japanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But
despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade
elsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to
backfire.
    He said in a radio interview today  "it is true that we
benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose
those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views
plain to the Japanese government on this matter."
    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before
returning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was
planned well before the current trade row.
    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also
include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global
markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a
cooperation between national regulatory bodies.
    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging
information to combat financial fraud would be sought with
Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between
Britain and the United States.

<TITLE>U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and Japanese officials meet
tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade
and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President
Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.
    But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord
could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from
about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.
    The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the
Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties
would be retroactive to March 31.
    Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he
hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in
semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.
    Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with
meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and
Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.
    The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include
Shigeru Muraoka, director-general of international trade policy
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and
Masashi Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information
and machinery bureau.
    Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima, director of the
Japan office of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, and Jim
Gradoville, of trade representative's office of industry and
services.
    The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be
headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and
MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda.

<TITLE>BRITAIN'S ECGD DISCUSSING NEW COVER FOR NIGERIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed at
resuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, the
head of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said.
    The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after the
country fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsured
debts.
    Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain and
Nigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts,
bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of
cover.
    Breach made his comments in an address to a private meeting
of businessmen, a copy of which was made available to the
press.
    Breach noted that for the ECGD to consider "a gradual
introduction of a package of new support" certain criteria would
have to be met.
    This would involve the Nigerian economic structural
adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by
the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on
course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a
satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of
the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.
    Breach said that these criteria are now beginning to be
satisfied, adding that while the ECGD could not yet formally
announce new cover, it was holding discussions with Nigeria on
priorities for new credits.
    He said an announcement would be made "as soon as possible"
on an agreement and the ECGD would create a package for Nigeria
that would include the department's normal range of export
trade support facilities.
    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.
    Breach noted that since cover was removed, the ECGD has
maintained a limited amount of short-term trade cover for
Nigeria, which was backed by letters of credit from the
Nigerian Central Bank.
    While the ECGD would initially continue to use this
structure under a new package, it would also hope to expand the
volume of coverage in the short-term area and relax the terms
it is prepared to underwrite towards the commonly accepted
maximum of 180 days.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.

<TITLE>CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
throughout the industrial world.
    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
full-scale trade war.
    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
environment increased the possibility of global economic
growth.
    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said.
    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant
retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
trade policy."
    The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
and must be closely watched.
    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
and reducing government's role in the economy.
    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"
Conable said.
    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
for some time.
    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many
countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
problem of debt."
    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
the World Bank.
    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
several weeks.
    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
richest countries because of inefficiency.
    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
member-countries as an indication of his management style and
priorities.
    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
permitted to grow," Conable said.
    However, he said "I don't believe there is anything
basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
has to have any redefinition of its purpose."
    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
in dealing with the debt crisis.
    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus on a variety of issues.
    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have
a particular mission here except to be useful to the
institution and to the process of development."
    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
the institution."
    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
Association was earmarked for Africa.
    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

<TITLE>BOEING SEEKS CAUSE OF JAL ENGINE PROBLEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Boeing Co. &lt;BA> is trying to find out
what caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's
747-SR jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer
said.
    "We know about the problem and we have provided a service
advisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "We are not
advising any massive inspections at this time."
    The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a
problem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it does
not recommend any action.
    "A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is
anything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said.
    A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routine
check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to
the wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue.
    The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of
its 747-SR's. The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been
modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan, mainly
between Tokyo and Osaka.
    The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a
higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs.
    Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlines
use the 747-SR. JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973
and purchased two more last year. He said the braces had been
shipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were being
inspected.

bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of
cover.
    Breach told a businessmen's meeting that for the ECGD to
consider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support"
certain criteria would have to be met.
    This would involve the Nigerian economic structural
adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by
the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on
course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a
satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of
the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.
    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.

<TITLE>BP CREDIT FACILITY SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A five billion dlr credit facility being
arranged for two units of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>
attracted over 15 billion dlrs in syndication but will not be
increased, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said on behalf of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co of New York, the arranger.
    It said that 64 of BP's relationship banks will be joining
the facility, although their participations will be cut back
dramatically. Banks had been invited as lead managers at 200
mln dlrs, managers at 125 mln and co-managers at 75 mln.
    BP will make the final decision on the allotments broadly
based on relationships rather than on the amounts offered.
    The facility is being arranged for BP International and BP
North America in conjunction with the company's planned tender
offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already
own.
    Because of the purpose of the facility, Morgan only had
five business days to arrange the facility. As a result, it
carried terms that bankers considered relatively favourable
when compared with those on most other recent credits. The
facility fee, for example, was 1/8 pct compared with the 1/16
pct BP paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing.

<TITLE>U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A steep drop in goods-producing jobs
detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes
it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
policy to defend the dollar, economists said.
    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less
than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets
expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with
February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment
dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.
    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
the second and third quarters."
    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"
he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but
clearly they can't tighten."
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000
from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
were weaker than expected.
    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.
gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March
jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter
growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.
    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only
237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, 
but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs
were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
tightening for exchange-related purposes."
    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January
level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing
hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9
hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.
    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and 
electronic manufacturing.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.
    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories
resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.
    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
the first-quarter GNP accounts.
    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two
pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the
second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial
activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."
    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
in industrial production and personal income for March.
They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for
these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct
in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.
    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851
million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in
January.
    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level
since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed
out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which 
fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.
    "This just means that there were fewer people looking for
work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.
    He said the latest employment report will not concern the
Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten
to quickly either."
    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with
his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.
    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think
that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to
ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March
employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,
regardless of the dollar."

<TITLE>UK SEEKS PACT WITH JAPAN FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard
said he will use a coming trip to Tokyo to seek a memorandum of
understanding between Britain and Japan on the exchange of
information to fight fraud in world financial markets.
    He told journalists that he would be seeking an agreement
with Japan similar to one struck last autumn between the U.K.
Department of Trade and Industry, on the one hand, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission on the other.
    Market sources have persistently speculated that it was
information passed on to the U.K. By the SEC through their pact
that triggered the DTI's investigations into (Guinness Plc's)
&lt;GUIN.L> takeover of &lt;Distillers Co Plc> last year.
    The probe, launched in December, triggered the resignation
of some of Guinness' senior management, including Chairman
Ernest Saunders.
    The Trade department, however, has never confirmed this and
has yet to state what its investigation actually concerns.

<TITLE>DRUG COMPANIES GET OUT OF COSMETICS BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several pharmaceutical companies, drawn
in the 1970s to the fast growing cosmetics industry, are no
longer finding it fashionable to sell makeup.
    "The fad right now is to purify and concentrate on the most
attractive business. Right now that's the drug business," said
David Saks, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead.
    Yesterday, Eli Lilly and Co joined the ranks of other drug
companies by choosing to sell off its lower growth Elizabeth
Arden cosmetics business.
    "It's not that Elizabeth Arden is bad. To some it may be
their pride and joy, but to Eli Lilly, it's a diversion of
their management energies and financial resources from their
gemstone, which is the drug business," Saks said.
    "Arden is a good company. I'm sure it's going to be a hot
property. I'm sure people will be lining up to buy it," said
Lynne Hyman, E.F. Hutton cosmetics analyst.
    Analysts said the Arden business could command about 600
mln dlrs, and likely buyers would be interested in its
well-known name and distribution channels.
                                   
    Analysts said Avon Products Inc, a door-to-door makeup
distributor, and the Japanese company Shiseido Co of Tokyo,
might be willing buyers. An Avon spokesman said the company is
interested in Arden, but it has not yet seen offering
documents.
    Analysts said most of the changes of control in the
cosmetics industry have been determined for the time being.
"There's not much out there that hasn't changed hands or isn't
relatively stable," said Hyman.
    Squibb &lt;SQB> last year sold its Charles of the Ritz
business to Yves Saint Laurent for 630 mln dlrs, and Beecham
Plc said last month it was selling its Germain Monteil unit to
Revlon Group &lt;REV>.
    American Cyanamid &lt;ACY>, a chemical and drug concern, is
selling its Jacqueline Cochran Inc unit.
    One big cosmetics concern whose fate hasn't been sealed is
Revlon Group Inc. The company received a takeover offer from
McAndrews and Forbes, which is controlled by its chairman,
Ronald Perelman.
    A major Revlon shareholder, McAndrews and Forbes, is
offering 18.50 dlrs per share to take the company private. But
Wall Street has been estimating values for the company of 20
dlrs per share and more. The stock was trading today at 20-7/8,
off 1/2.
    Analysts said Revlon's cosmetics lines and name might be
attractive to a corporate buyer, but they doubt one would jump
into the situation one analyst described as a "can of worms."
    Analysts said drug companies are getting high prices for
the cosmetics companies. They said buyers are attracted by
strong brand names because of profit stability and prestige.

<TITLE>SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
offers are open if key conditions are changed.
    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.
securities law, SEC officials said.
    The SEC has already said that other specific material
changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
    The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
conditions were waived.
    SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
dissemination," the SEC said.
    Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
remain open for at least 20 business days.

<TITLE>NEWS CORP'S &lt;NWS> FOX DEBUTS U.S. NETWORK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fox Broadcasting, owned by Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, is set to launch two prime time
television shows this Sunday on what some have called the
fourth television network.
    The company, built around Murdoch's two billion dlr
acquisition of seven television stations last year, marks the
first network startup since 1948, when ABC, now owned by
Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB>, hit the airwaves.
    "I think our goal, more than anything else, is to provide
an alternative to the three networks," said Fox president Jamie
Kellner.
    Fox's debut comes when earnings at two of the three
networks are under pressure and network advertising dollars
have been growing slowly.
    "The barriers to entry are exceptionally high," industry
analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said. "Their (Fox) saving
grace is that their parent has deep pockets."
    The question television industry, advertising and Wall
Street executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure
advertisers from the big three: CBS Inc &lt;CBS>, ABC, and NBC, a
unit of General Electric Co &lt;GE>.
    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in
1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting for
all of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analysts
noted.
    "They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the
traditional networks," said Jon Mandel, associate media
director at Grey Advertising Inc.
    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainment
attorney said, "If they have enough money, they have a good
chance of making it work."
    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to
lose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln
dlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a
profit.
    To succeed, the company must also win over the young
viewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two of
which debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.
    The first Fox-produced program -- "The Late Show,"
featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on
Fox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the
show has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captive
young audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.
    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,
"Married ... with Children," which Kellner describes as an
alternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.
It is also airing "The Tracy Ullman Show," featuring the
British comedienne, singer and actress.
    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the
U.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated
stations.
    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, the
company is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three
times in the course of the evening.
    "I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional
networks, it would be extremely high-rated," Mandel said, who
added that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in
advertising for the shows.
    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth
network. Robert Adler, president of the Cabletelevision
Advertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to the
audience Fox is attempting to win. "There are already many
alternatives out there to the three networks," he said.
    And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Fox
the competition. An ABC spokesman said, "the schedule we've put
together for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox's
programming schedule into account."
    But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping a
eye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and with
its advertisers.
    Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Asked
whether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday's
debut, Kellner said, "the last thing I want to do is worry
about ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told me
to do."

<TITLE>U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Brough, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. scientists said some tropical
vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to
a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for
labelling changes.
    The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by
Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm
kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
    In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and
coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
manufacturers' labels.
    The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.
    Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
contributes to heart disease are untrue.
    But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human
health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."
    He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the
blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that
high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
disease," he said.
    A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge
Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is
cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer
properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
in humans.
    Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from
palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.
    David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on
labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels,"
said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he
will make an intelligent choice."
    The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,
palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.
    Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More
saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that
point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in
the blood are a risk factor for heart disease."
    Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,
said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
heart disease.
    The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than
20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.
    David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said
U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273
mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.
    Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.
soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.
    U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln
lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year
earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.
    Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3
mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.

<TITLE>SNYDER &lt;SOI> MAKES CENERGY &lt;CRG> EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Snyder Oil Partners L.P. told the
Securities and Exchange Commission it made an exchange offer to
Cenergy Corp that would allow Snyder to acquire up to 49.9 pct
of the company's common stock.
    Under the exchange offer, which was proposed yesterday to
Cenergy's officers and directors, each share of Cenergy common
stock could be exchanged for 8.50 dlrs in market value of
Snyder's limited partnership units, Snyder said.
    Under the proposal, Snyder, which already holds 1,170,400
Cenergy common shares, or 12.0 pct of the total, could boost
its Cenergy stake to a total of 49.9 pct, it said.
    Snyder did not say whether it has received any response to
its proposal from Cenergy.
    If it acquires the 49.9 pct stake, Snyder said in its SEC
filing it would use the stock to "obtain a proportionate
beneficial interest" in the company's assets and liabilities.
    It said it has not decided its next move it the exchange
proposal does not lead to negotiations with Cenergy.
    Snyder said it may boost its stake or sell some or all of
its current holdings. It repeated a statement made in its
initial SEC filing last month that it is considering several
alternatives, including seeking control of Cenergy.

<DATELINE>     CHICAGO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears, Roebuck and Co said in its
annual report that its Merchandise Group plans 1987 capital
expenditures of 355 mln dlrs, up from 280.4 mln dlrs in 1986.
   It said about 131 mln dlrs will be used for 32 new and
relocated stores and 38 new paint and hardware stores. The
nation's largest retailer also said it plans to remodel 126
stores this year.
    Of five new stores to open in 1987, Sears said four will
replace units in markets already served and one will be in a
new area. At yearend 1986, the company said it had 284
full-line stores operating in its new market-driven format.
    Sears said it was "optimistic" about prospects for 1987,
citing its positioning to meet merchandise and financial
service needs of its customers.
    To broaden its apparel customer base, Sears said it will
issue a new catalog called "Changes" featuring natural fiber
clothing. It said the catalog, printed on oversized pages, will
be distributed in limited markets in 1987, with national
circulation planned for 1988.
    In the annual report, Sears reiterated its expectation that
losses from introducing the company's financial services
instrument, Discover Card, should continue to decline
throughout 1987 and cross the breakeven line and generate a
profit in 1988.
    The company scheduled its annual meeting for May 14.

<TITLE>CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By LARRY WELSH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
analysts said.
    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
about 50 pct.
    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
record highs.
    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
part of the investment community that the outlook for the
industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co
Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
year's results, analysts said.
    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
future," Gobert commented.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
at the end of 1986.
    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is
trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is
at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.
    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"
he added.
    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
billion dlrs.
    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
production accord will continue to support prices.
    However, several companies share the optimistic industry
outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.
    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
deferring most frontier exploration work.
    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"
Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
    The most significant help came last September when the
federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
more," Maciej said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rising demand for U.S. rice may
gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
July 31.
    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
expected to decline this year, the report said.
    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
faster rate, USDA said.
    "Development of new products and increased promotion have
helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
consumers," USDA said.
    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
    "The United States has already recovered a substantial share
of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
in the Middle East and Africa," the report said.
    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
increased domestic production and low import prices have
allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
grains.
    China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
mid-1970s, the report said.

<TITLE>HUTTON &lt;EFH> STILL INTERESTED IN PUROLATOR &lt;PCC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested
in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining
the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.
Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from
Emery Air Freight Corp &lt;EAF> earlier this week.
    "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Hutton
spokesman said.
    "We want to see what the offer is completely and understand
it fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said.
    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on
its offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.
    Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the
offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier
time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost
savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.
    Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has
declined comment.
    Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on
speculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at
40-3/8, above the Emery offer.

<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mellon Bank Corp said a shareholder
filed a class action suit in Philadelphia in light of the
precipitous decline in Mellon's stock on the New York Stock
Exchange.
    Mellon's stock fell 3-1/2 to 40-7/8 today after plunging
6-1/4 yesterday after the bank holding company reported its
first loss in its 118 years, according to the shareholder, John
Paul Decker.
    Yesterday, the company said it expected to report a first
quarter loss of between 55 mln and 65 mln dlrs and its
intention to reduce the quarterly dividend.
    The shareholder charges that Mellon and its senior officers
failed to disclose the company's true financial condition
during the class period, between February 1, 1985 and
April 2, 1987 
    Mellon said it had no comment because it had not yet seen
the suit.

<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>International LPG prices were mixed in
the past week, with North Sea prices easier while prices in the
Mediterranean and the Gulf were up in April, traders said.
    In the North Sea market, small cargoes of propane were sold
as high as 126 dlrs per tonne on the f.o.b. basis early in the
week, but prices eased after the majors posted their April
contract prices, traders said.
    British Petroleum plc &lt;BP> left propane unchanged at 110
dlrs and raised butane prices 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, Shell, a
unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST> raised propane three
dlrs to 113 and butane 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, they said.
    In the Mediterranean, prices firm in Lavera as Algerian
supplies were not always available. Spot propane was unchanged,
while butane rose about 25 dlrs from last week, traders said.
    They said, however, the Mediterranean butane market was
very thin, making it subject to wide price swings.
    In the Gulf, strong demand from the Far East pushed premium
on small cargoes five to 10 dlrs above government selling price
(gsp) for propane and 10 dlrs for butane, traders said. 
    The rising premium over gsp, however, was partially offset
by about 10 pct decline in shipping, making prices for propane
about unchanged and butane five dlrs higher, basis c. and f.
Japan, the traders said.

<TITLE>SCOTT INSTRUMENTS &lt;SCTI> GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DENTON, Texas, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Scott Instruments Corp said its
independent public accountants qualified the report on Scott's
1986 financial statements because of its weak financial
condition.
    The report indicates the realization of the company's
assets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to
finance operations and additional funds to meet other
liabilities, among other things.
    These factors indicate the company may be unable to
continue its existence.
    Earlier, Scott reported a 1986 loss of 1.9 mln dlrs
compared to a loss of almost 2.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Total assets
were nearly 1.1 mln dlrs at year end, down from 1.2 mln dlrs
the prior year.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street scored its biggest one
session gain ever, climbing to a record in extremely active
trading. A strong bond market, triggering arbitrage related buy
programs and drawing many short sellers in to even up
positions, propelled stocks sharply higher.
    "This was a startling performance in a week that began with
a nervous selloff and growing anxiety about inflation, interest
rates and trade friction," Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co
said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 70 points to
2390. Outdistancing the previous one day record gain of 54
points set on February 17.

<DATELINE>    DANBURY, Conn., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Network Control Corp said it
intends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for the
third quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarter
would be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the
same year-ago quarter.
    Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant
increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for
more than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will
collect most of those accounts.
    It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for
its new products and a delay in a major order.

reiterated his hope that this week's rise in prime rates would

    "I would hope that it would simply be a temporary blip
upward as we've seen in the past," Baker said in television
interview with the Cable News Network. The interview airs
tomorrow but CNN released extracts from his remarks today.
    Baker also repeated his position that the reaction of
financial markets to U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods
showed "the importance of the United States not going
protectionist. The markets were telling us...be careful."

<TITLE>KENAI &lt;KEN> SETS NOTE OFFER, AVOIDS CHAPTER 11</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kenai Corp said its shareholders
approved of a reorganization to avoid a chapter 11 filing under
the U.S. bankruptcy code.
    Shareholders approved an increase in authorized shares to
two billion common and two mln preferred, with a par value of
0.001 dlrs per share. A portion of the new shares will be
issued to holders of 57.5 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures,
all of which are in default.
    The company, which was also merged into a subsidiary, said
its 35.7 mln outstanding shares will be exchanged for shares in
the new company on a one-for-one basis.
    According to the exchange offer, each 1,000 dlrs principle
of subordinated debentures will be exchanged for 1,000 shares
of common stock, 500 dlrs principal of a variable interest
subordinated debenture and 24 shares of convertible preferred
stock, the company said.
    It said the offer will result in the issue of 57.5 mln
common shares, 28.85 mln dlrs principle of variable rate
subordinated debentures, and 1.38 mln shares of convertible
preferred stock.
    The company said two holders of 29.9 mln dlrs of debentures
who have already exchanged their holdings for 20.8 mln common
shares and 23.5 mln dlrs principle amount of notes will
resubmit the securities to meet the terms of the current
exchange offer.
    It said the offer is dependent on filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
    The company also said that upon completion of the exchange
offer, it may issue warrants to buy 100 mln shares of common
stock to current shareholders and warrants for 75 mln shares to
employees.

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Four U.S. meat processors have asked
the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
the species from which it was derived.
    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredients
statement instead of "mechanically separated pork."
    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
and poultry portion of the product.
    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
statement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.
    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
term carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the minds
of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
regulation exists for poultry products.
    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Open Market Committee at
its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the
then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.
    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy
directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than
easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January
through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no
M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a
seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.
    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds
rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.
    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members
discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in
Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No
conclusions were contained in the minutes.
    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC
said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or
slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable
depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into
account the strength of the business expansion, developments in
foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and
conditions in domestic and international credit markets."
    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged
policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president
favored some tightening of reserve conditions.
    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November
through January and the firm federal funds rate that had
prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He
also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.
    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential
for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed
that prompt restraints might avert the need for more
substantial tightening later.
    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC
minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy
implementation should be especially alert to the potential need
for some firming of reserve conditions."
    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve
restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in
line with current expectations and there were concurrent
indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the
background of stronger economic data.
    One indication of potential price pressure might be a
further tendency for the dollar to weaken.
    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,
preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing
during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not
want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during
the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the
conditions for such a move as likely to emerge."
    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the
dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any
significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In
addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be
made in reducing the federal budget deficit.

DRUG COMPANIES =6 NEW YORK
    Hyman said cosmetics used to be more appealing to drug
companies, but product lines have matured and competition
became more fierce. "At one time, the profit margins in these
businesses were more attractive. The businesses were small and
had a lot of opportunity to grow," she said.
    Analysts said drugs, while ultimately subject to patent
expirations, can be marketed for years without competition from
generic products. Cosmetics, however, are fad related and there
are no barriers to competition.
    Saks said pharmaceutical companies in the last two years
have been selling non-strategic assets, among them the once
alluring cosmetics businesses.
    Pfizer Inc &lt;PFE> and Schering-Plough Corp &lt;SGP> remain
among the only two drug companies with cosmetics concerns.
    Schering is committed to its Maybelline cosmetics unit.
    "We've made a strategic determination as a company that
cosmetics is a main line business for us, and we want to
develop it aggressively," the spokesman said. The spokesman
would not comment on whether Schering would want to add by
acquisition to that line.
    Pfizer had no comment, but analyst Ronald Nordmann of
PaineWebber said he does not believe Pfizer would want to sell
off its Coty business.
    Analysts said Elizabeth Arden is one of the more attractive
cosmetics concerns.
    Hyman said the company's performance should be in line with
the expectations for the U.S. industry. She predicts the U.S.
industry in 1987 will have unit growth of three pct and sales
growth of six pct.
    She estimated U.S. cosmetic sales to amount to about two
billion dlrs annually.
    Arden had operating profits of 32.6 mln dlrs in 1986 on
sales of 397.9 mln dlrs.

    In a letter to Congress, Reagan also said he was not

<TITLE>U.S. CABLE TV CREDIT UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE, SAYS S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said that the
credit quality of most U.S. cable television companies is
unlikely to improve in the near term.
    S and P said that after two years and many delays and
disappointments, the cable television industry has firmly
established a net cash generating position.
    However, rather than using their improved position to
decrease the leverage of current capital structures, the
companies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance a
wave of consolidations, S and P said.
    Many cable television companies exhibit greater financial
risk because of their asset growth aspirations and
debt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profile
for many of them, Standard and Poor's said.
    The acquisition and financial growth policies of many
company executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.
    Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cash
flow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5
times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensive
now than in their building phase. These factors keep their
ratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded.

domestic bonds was selling early in the day, dealers said.

1/4 point on the day. Rumors of a major seller were not

domestic bonds. The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run oil company Ecopetrol said
Colombia's main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of
170,000 barrels per day was suspended.
    A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morning
dynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on the
Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia's biggest
oilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean.
    She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled and
could not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack was
near Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province.
    Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association with
Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> and Shell Petroleum N.V., a
unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST>.
    Ecopetrol said in a communique that bombings since last

<TITLE>U.S. DEFENDS STOCKPILED TIN SALES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States defended its sales
of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from
Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with
southeast Asian producers.
    "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of
the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the
ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman
said in a statement.
    "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into
account in determining disposal levels," the statement said.
    The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a
memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.
    In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber
of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well
above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United
States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum
of Understanding," it said.
    The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals
increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market
conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,
they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.
    The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the
GSA sold last year, however.

<TITLE>TIME &lt;TL> SEES DILUTION FROM SCOTT, FORESMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott,
Foresman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by
about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987.
    For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative
impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer
Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
    He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will
contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before
depreciation and amortization for the full year.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.
    Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its
highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the
first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on
book publishing income for the first quarter.
    "First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be
better than last year," Bigelow said.
    The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the
effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the
company is "comfortable" with estimates that earnings will be
between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY MARKET ENDS SHARPLY HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply
higher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market
Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing
degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.
    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and
a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that
pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal
funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.
    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4
higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from
7.93 pct yesterday.
    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that
recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a
another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.
    "Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which
should give them more room to not tighten," she said. "Both M2
and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in
March."
    "The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,"
Zielonka said. "Dollar considerations will prevent them from
easing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy
weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil."
    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only
by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm
payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to
236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.
    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by
fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when
the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its
gains.
    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,
but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying
late in the day that offset this somewhat.
    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from
this week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and
Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors
from buying U.S. Treasury bonds.
    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32
in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped
the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen
yesterday.
    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills
rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis
points and the year bill fell two basis points.
    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills
resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a
customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by
foreign central banks to support the dollar.
    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a
decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the
session, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.
    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct
bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to
respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.

<TITLE>GABELLI EXPLAINS SALE OF GENCORP &lt;GY> SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mario Gabelli, head of New York
investment firm Mario Gabelli and Co, said he sold some shares
of GenCorp Inc &lt;GY> as part of a "portfolio rebalancing"
process to meet the needs of his more than 600 clients.
    He said as the stock moved up following acquisition
proposals from a group formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and
Wagner and Brown, some of his clients were overweighted.
    Regarding the company's shareholders meeting Tuesday,
Gabelli told Reuters, "there was nothing said that caused me to
sell or buy." He still thinks "values are 140 dlrs per share or
more" and has clients that asked to buy more.
    Gabelli said he amended certain filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission because his clients are now passive
investors. "We wanted to remove our clients from the process
unfolding between GenCorp and Wagner and Brown," he said.
    He said he was pleased that chairman A. William Reynolds
stated at the meeting that he found the concept of greenmail to
be "repugnant." Greenmail refers to a corporation buying out a
shareholder at a premium not available to others.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a 90
mln dlr loan to Yugoslavia's third largest bank to support a
project promoting energy conservation and substituting
lower-cost energy sources for present sources.
    It said the loan consists of a credit line to Ljubljanska
Banka, Ljubljana (LBL), to finance a project expected to
improve industrial competitiveness and reduce energy imports,
easing the country's current balance-of-payments difficulties.
    The loan will also support development of technical
capabilities for energy audit work and strengthen the financial

    The Bank said the project will benefit small and
medium-sized industries, primarily in Yugoslavia's Republic of

abroad for technical and financial personnel.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER FROM JANUARY BLAHS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Barbara, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged
during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels
of 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully rebounded
from its January slump.
    Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in
years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.
    For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers
sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving
the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That
rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.
    "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day
period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham
Lambert.
    "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latest
figures build on that. This lends some encouragement to the
idea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.
    In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on
an annual basis, before dropping again.
    Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to
take advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from
normal January selling.
    But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market
and a growing array of incentives have lured customers to
dealers' showrooms, analysts said.
   Ford Motor Co &lt;F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to
79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's
second largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to
197,328 compared to 167,490.
    Chrysler Corp &lt;C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454
compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3
pct from 90,945.
    Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest
6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. But
sales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from
370,390.
    Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the
slackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales
decline in memory.
    "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a
phenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis at
Morgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so
they've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."
    General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2
pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year
and far below the 56 pct of most of last year.
    Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the
first three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise
from 13.7 pct since the start of the year.
    Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted
the company to decide this week to close six plants for a week
to bring supply into line with demand.
    But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further
production cuts might be necessary.
    "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter
production already because of weak sales, the continuation of
this weakening market share suggests another production cutback
is likely," Glantz said.
    Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during
the March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp &lt;AMC> 1,198,
down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda
16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.

earlier announced shareholder class action suit was totally
without merit and that it would vigorously defend it.
    Earlier, an attorney for shareholder John Paul Decker said
he filed suit due to the precipitous decline in Mellon's stock
since reporting on Thursday that it would be posting a first
quarter loss of 55-65 mln dlrs.
    Mellon's stock fell 3-5/8 to 40-3/4 today after plunging

that Mellon failed to disclose its true financial condition
between February 1, 1985 and April 2, 1987.

<TITLE>GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BEAUMONT, Texas, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf States Utilities Co said
its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its
operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless
it receives additional financing or rate relief from state
public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.
    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K
filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the
utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.
Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin
making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than
the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.
    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company
may have to seek protection from its creditors under the
bankruptcy code," Gulf States said.
    The utility had previously said it might be forced to
consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"
Gulf States said.
    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
emergency rate relief.
    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

<TITLE>FINANCE UNITS GAIN FROM PARENT COMPANY, SAYS S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's said that currently
17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving
higher ratings than their financial performance alone would
merit.
    By drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker
finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its
parent.  An independent finance company on the other hand must
operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at
a competitive disadvantage, S and P said. 
    The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as
well as the support agreement it has with its parent.
    Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiaries
have formal support agreements with the parent company which
obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  The
agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time
and requires it to operate within specific guidelines.
    Others have less formal agreements with the parent like
General Electric Credit Corp &lt;GE> whose AAA rating reflects its
parent's, General Electric Co.  But GE injected sizeable equity
into the unit at timely intervals, S and P noted.
    These agreements are being tested as finance firms expand,
and S and P said it will review a unit that violates the pact.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PERU SAYS IT INTENDS TO DEEPEN DEBT STANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Alan Garcia said he sought to
deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by
limiting repayments to the World Bank.
    In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World
Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount
the bank is willing to make in new loans. "We will deepen our
policy on the foreign debt," he said.
    Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of
export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due
foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally
been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on
payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank.
    But tonight Garcia said: "We have met our aim of limiting
the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though
organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us
to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types
of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars
than that which they are willing to newly lend us."
    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank
about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr
debt.
    Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin
America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line
on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.
    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage
to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage
workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.
    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants
and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but
not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
    He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1,
1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per
U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the
year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.
    Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue
earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes.
Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up,
he said, without specifying the amount.
    Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians
to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct
premium above the market exchange rate.
    The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is
14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.
    To encourage private investment, he said the government
would set up a special fund with which it would match every two
intis of private investment with one inti from the government.
    He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander
Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday
strengthened the democratic authority of his government.

<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea ordered the takeover of six
financially troubled overseas construction firms and two
shipping companies under the government's industrial
realignment programme, Finance Ministry officials said.
    They said the Industrial Policy Deliberation Committee
decided to allow concessionary loans to three firms taking over
the eight. The companies involved would be exempted from
corporate tax and property transfer and registration taxes.
    Under the programme, five subsidaries of &lt;Chung Woo
Development Co Ltd> will be taken over by &lt;Byuck San Corp>,
&lt;Korea Develpoment Corp> by &lt;Daelim Industrial Co Ltd>, and two
subsidaries of &lt;Korea Shipping Corp> by the &lt;Hanjin Group>.
    Another five construction companies were ordered to improve
their financial status by reorganising their subsidiaries or
selling off unproductive real estate holdings to help repay
bank loans, the officials said.
    These are &lt;Pacific Construction Co Ltd>, &lt;Life Construction
Co Ltd>, &lt;Chin Heung International Co Ltd>, &lt;Samick Co Ltd> and
&lt;Hanshin Construction Co Ltd>.
    A further five shipping companies -- &lt;Hanjin Container Line
Ltd>, &lt;Choyang Shipping Co Ltd>, &lt;Hyundai Merchant Marine Co
Ltd>, &lt;Pan Ocean Shipping Co> and &lt;Dooyang Line Co Ltd> -- will
be allowed to defer the repayment of bank loans and interest,
but details have yet to be finalised, the officials said.
    They said the government would take similar measures for
more companies in August in line with the continuing
realignment policy, which had already affected 56 firms last
year.

<TITLE>UAE OIL PRODUCTION DROPS TEN PCT IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, April 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oil output in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05
mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer
resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources
said.
    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy
Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a
barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72
dlrs.
    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE
producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of
800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.
    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from
around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a
mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the
sources added.
    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif
and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed
prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.
    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese
term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they
added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it
Murban.
    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on
stream in 1983, to be test production not included in
calculations for complying with the OPEC quota.
    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its
quota in March, the sources added.

increased its production of sugarcane by 26.8 pct to 9.4 mln
tonnes in the 1986-87 crushing season (November to March) from
the previous year, the New China News Agency said.
    The cane, grown on 206,000 hectares, yielded 1.04 mln
tonnes of refined sugar, it said without giving comparative
figures.
    China's sugar output in calendar 1986 rose to 5.24 mln
tonnes from 4.45 mln in calendar 1985, official figures show.
An official newspaper said in January that output in the
1986/87 crushing season would be only 4.82 mln tonnes because
of a drop in acreage due to low profits on growing cane and
beet.

industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by
between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in
1986, the Ifo economic institute said.
    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting
the engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two
to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.
    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply
for capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.
    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in
1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose
5.1 pct.
    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last
year, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.
This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low
domestic consumption.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES APPROVES 80 MLN DLR DEBT CONVERSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Central Bank has approved the
conversion of 80.7 mln dlrs worth of Philippine debt into
equity in local projects under a debt-to-equity swap program
started last August, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told reporters the amount represented 57 transactions
involving diversified investments. He said 90 applications to
convert 316.7 mln dlrs of debt have so far been received by the
Central Bank.
    Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC), a
World Bank affiliate, would invest up to 12.5 mln dlrs in the
First Philippine Capital Fund.
    The fund, to be launched jointly by New York investment
house Shearson Lehman Brothers and IFC, was proposed by Ongpin
during a trip to the United States in September.
    There was still no word on when the fund, designed to
encourage private sector investment in the Philippines, would
be launched.
    A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will
consist of exchanging up to 12.5 mln dlrs face value of
Philippine debt it holds.
    The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion
plan are both aimed at reducing the country's debt burden by
enabling interested investors to buy government notes at a
discount, repatriate these and convert them at full value in
pesos.
    The proceeds will then be used to investing in local
projects.
    The country's foreign debt now stands at 27.8 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Plessey Co Plc announced it had won a
100 mln dlr digital telephone exchange order in the United
States, which it said was the first major U.S. Telephone
exchange order not to go to established U.S. Suppliers.
    &lt;South Central Bell Telephone Co>, a unit of Bellsouth Corp
&lt;BLS.N>, placed the order with Plessey's U.S. Subsidiary
&lt;Stromberg-Carlson>.
    Most of the equipment for the 100 exchanges will be built
in Stromberg-Carlson's Florida plant over the next three years.
    "It is the most important thing that has happened in the
Plessey telecommunications business," said Plessey
Telecommunications Managing Director David Dey.
    The British firm failed to win a four billion dlr deal to
supply an advanced communications system to the U.S. Army in
November 1985 despite personal lobbying by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. A rival French system won the contract.

<TITLE>MANILA MEETING WITH DONORS ON LAND REFORM RESET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine officials will meet major aid
donors in May to discuss a 500 mln dlr funding for an extensive
land reform program, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with a
consultative group of major donors led by the World Bank late
this month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the project
would not be ready until the end of this month.
    "The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time in
the second half of May because it is pointless to have that
meeting unless the participants have had adequate time to
review the documentation," he said.
    Government officials said the progam, estimated to cost 36
billion pesos, aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land,
including some 50,000 hectares seized from former associates of
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
    The new plan will include not only rice and corn land but
also sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefit
about three mln impoverished peasants.
    Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in the
program from donors but said given the substantial financial
requirements of the plan, the government could not rely on only
one source but on a combination of sources.
    President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of an
estimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale of
certain non-performing assets to private companies.
    Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two other
sources, namely the proceeds from the sale of government
corporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from the
liquidation of seized Marcos-related assets.
    He also said he would recommend public hearings before such
a big project was legislated.
    "If we get a good reception in the public hearings, perhaps
then the President might feel persuaded that it is not
necessary to wait for the Congress," he said.
    Aquino had said she would prefer that legislation for the
program be approved by a two-house Congress, whose members will
be elected on May 11.
    But her advisers are trying to persuade her to implement
the program before the Congress convenes in July.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the
only element standing in the way of full British membership of
the European Monetary System (EMS).
    But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the
strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made
clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the
next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.
    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after
an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here
that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in
the way of full membership.
    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which
Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,
there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system
to be considered, he said.
    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system
based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling
system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work."
    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had
made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed
less of a problem.
    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,
which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly
weakened," he said.
    Lawson restated that the government was keeping the
question of membership under review.

<TITLE>EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC)
finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for
greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System
(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.
    "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary
System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark
Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of
informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.
    The gathering was the first such discussion since the
second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in
January.
    The system has come under severe strain as funds have
flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS
currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against
weaker currencies in the system.
    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading
western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at
around current levels was working and this would allow the EC
to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the
EMS.
    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the
need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of
interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials
between different countries.
    They also agreed they needed better coordination of
exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both
when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their
agreed margins.
    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of
technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in
Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's
Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.
    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic
convergence betwen Community countries and it was important
that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange
rates and inflation rates.
    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the
presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not
produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing
the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and
monetary integration.
    "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal
functioning of the system," Eyskens said.
    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS
has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all
movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go
ahead.
    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the
meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final
phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would
include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the
move would create difficulties.
    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also
discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities
by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by
telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.
    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.
    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told
journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater
coordination of exchange market intervention was the question
of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in
central bank reserves.
    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would
work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an
issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the
Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.
    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments
reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the
January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.
   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and
West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in
the system that forced the parity overhaul.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian currency further depreciated
yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a
two-tier foreign exchange system last month.
    The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at
16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the
dollar.
    The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction,
reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the
government offered eight mln dlrs.
    Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine
kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of
five currencies, for certain official transactions.
    It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction
only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where
the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market
demand.
    The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive
than the previous one, suspended in January after the central
bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders.
    Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil
company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is
allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange
on offer.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE DENIES ANY FURTHER ARMS SALES TO IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House denied a report that
the United States was continuing to ship arms or
weapons-related equipment to Iran, but an administration
official said there had been non-weapons sales to Tehran
through commercial channels.
    "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no illegal
sales from the forbidden munitions list," a White House
spokesman said.
    The Defence Department also denied any military supplies
had been sent to Iran since an administration ban late last
year.
    NBC television, quoting U.S. And foreign intelligence
sources, reported that the United States had been shipping
weapons-related equipment to Iran as recently as last month.
    The administration official, who asked not to be named,
told Reuters there had been commercial sales of products
licensed by the Commerce Department, which maintains a list of
products that can be exported without hurting national
security.
    President Reagan banned arms shipments to Tehran after the
Iran arms scandal broke last November.
    In January Secretary of State George Shultz told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee there would be "no more transfers of
U.S.-origin military equipment to Iran, either directly or
through third parties."
    The NBC report said the Pentagon was coordinating shipments
of anti-aircraft command and control equipment used to direct
fire of weapons systems.
    It said some shipments labelled "machine parts" had moved
through Ostend, Belgium,on aircraft of the Santa Lucia Airways,
which it identified as operated by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA). The CIA refused to comment.
    NBC said the equipment was flown to Pakistan and then on to
Iran by Pakistani civilian and military aircraft.
    Later, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said: "We
categorically deny that the United States is selling and/or
sending any weapons to Iran." She added that Washington was "not
doing anything in connection with the government of Iran which
is not consistent with U.S. Laws or trade policy."
    Another administration official, who asked not to be
identified, told Reuters the United States had licensed
commercial sales of low-technology computer equipment to Iran,
amounting to about 60 mln dlrs over the last three years.

<TITLE>U.S. NAVY SAID INCREASING PRESENCE NEAR GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has
ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in
an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil
flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.
    The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy
would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the
Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three
months longer than planned.
    The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to
eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the
time, as happens now, the paper said.
    The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources
said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a
Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of
Hormuz.
    It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready
to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against
Iraq.
    U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of
those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted
officials as saying.
    From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch
aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could
fire long-range missiles, the paper said.

<TITLE>JAL PLANE CRASH THOUGHT DUE TO BOEING &lt;BA.N> FAULT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Janet Snyder, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Japanese government investigation team
believes that faulty repairs by Boeing Co caused the worst
single plane crash in history, one of the team said.
    Boeing Co is the manufacturer of the Japan Air Lines 747
jumbo jet which crashed into a mountain in Japan on August 12,
1985, killing 520 people. There were only four survivors.
    A Boeing spokesman, contacted by telephone at the firm's
headquarters in Seattle, Washington, told Reuters the firm
would probably have no comment to make until the Japanese
investigation team's report was officially released.
    The team investigator, a Japanese Transport Ministry
official who declined to be identified, said a failure by
Japanese aircraft inspectors to check the repair work done on
the plane by a Boeing team had provoked an internal debate in
the Ministry over inspection procedures.
    The Ministry official told Reuters that a report by his
team, which has already been sent in draft form to the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be
released in late May. Under an international convention, the
draft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinent
authorities.
    Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash, a
Ministry spokesman declined comment.
    On September 6, 1985, Boeing issued an official statement
saying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan Air
Lines plane in 1978 were faulty.
    However, no official, direct connection was then made
between the faulty repairs and the crash.
    The Japanese investigation team says in its draft report
that it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the
1985 accident, the investigator said.
    The Boeing statement after the crash said: "Examination of
the wreckage, the flight data recorder readout, the cockpit
voice recorder, and interviews with the surviving off-duty
flight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flight
due to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead.
    "The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of the
crash has revealed that a relatively small section of the
bulkhead splice, approximately 17 per cent, was not correctly
assembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landing
accident," the statement said.
    The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident at
Osaka airport, in western Japan, in which the plane's tail
scraped the runway.
    The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectors
who in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving the
repairs, he said.
    Police had investigated four inspectors, including one man
who two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide after
four days of police questioning.
    "None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work," the
investigator said.

<TITLE>BOUYGUES &lt;BOUY.PA> TV AWARD SEEN BOOSTING GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A consortium headed by the construction
group Bouygues SA has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stake
in French state television network TF1, which stock market
analysts said represented a major boost for Bouygues.
    The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the less
likely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded the
three billion franc stake by the National Commission for
Communications and Liberties (NCCL), the French television
watchdog authority.
    The losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishing
group Hachette SA &lt;HACP.PA>.
    The NCCL decision awarded the Bouygues consortium a 50-pct
controlling stake in a company which will have a 10-year
operating concession for TF1, France's oldest and most widely
watched television network.
    Independent market analysis group C.O.P.S. In a note on
Bouygues said the award would represent a major diversification
for the group out of the highly cyclical construction industry
into the rapidly expanding media business.
    Bouygues in February said it estimated 1986 group net
attributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for
1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from
26.3 billion.
    The sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisition
of the loss-making SCREG construction group last year.
    Bouygues closed on the Paris stock market at 1,451 francs
on Friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below its
year's high of 1,475.
    Hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250.
    Bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium,
giving it a 25-pct stake in TF1.
    The U.K.-based &lt;Pergamon Media Trust> of Robert Maxwell has
a 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stake
in TF1, while &lt;Maxwell Media France> has a six pct stake, or
three pct of the television network.
    Minority shareholders in the consortium include the
&lt;GMF/FNAC> group, Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, &lt;Editions
Mondiale>, the &lt;Groupe Bernard Tapie>, &lt;Financiere Faltas>,
&lt;Banque Indosuez> and Credit Lyonnais &lt;CRLP.PA>.
    The remaining 50 pct of TF1 is to be split between a 40-pct
stake to be offered to the general public and a 10-pct stake to
be offered to employees.

<DATELINE>    ALGIERS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Algerian and Spanish producers which
together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in
quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300
dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.
    The agreement was made during a meeting here last week
between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et
Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the
market situation.
    The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by
some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the
whole market since they take into account only part of the
deals made," a statement by ENOF said.
    The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two
firms' production costs.
    "They have thus decided that their selling price would not
be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications
and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob
per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement
said.
    It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two
firms meet again in Madrid later this month.
    The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange
hovered around 200 dlrs this week.

<TITLE>PARIS CLUB AGREES NEW AFRICAN DEBT INITIATIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Western creditor
governments have reached agreement in principle on new
proposals for easing the debt burden of sub-Saharan African
countries, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said.
    He told journalists the accord, reached in the so-called
Paris Club of western governments, calls for rescheduling the
debts of sub-Saharan African countries over very long periods
and on very favourable terms.
    The proposals will be put forward for discussion at a
meeting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank
Development Committee in Washington next week, he said.
    Lawson said that under the proposals countries could have
15 or 20 years to repay their debts along with have a grace
period.
    But he added the favourable terms would not be offered
indiscriminately to all nations in the region but granted on a
case-by-case basis.
    The Paris Club groups Western governments -- as opposed to
commercial banks -- which are owed money by poorer nations.
    Lawson was speaking after an informal gathering of European
Community finance ministers and central bankers held to prepare
for discussions on international monetary issues and Third
World debt at next week's spring meetings of the IMF and World
Bank.
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he had
insisted at the gathering that developed countries take
adequate account of the problems facing poorer nations that
were trying to put their ailing economies in order.
    He told journalists he would be unveiling new proposals for
dealing with the Third World debt problem in  Washington.
    He declined to give details but Belgian Finance Minister
Mark Eyskens, who hosted the talks, indicated that Balladur's
proposals involved giving a greater role to a World Bank fund
used to compensate developing countries for falls in the prices
of their main commodities.
    "The French ideas got a very sympathetic welcome," Eyskens
told a news conference.
    He said the European Community felt a new IMF
(International Monetary Fund) report which forecasts
inflation-adjusted economic growth of just 2.5 pct in the
industrialised world this year, compared with 3.1 pct expected
last autumn, was slightly too pessimistic.
    Many economists believe industrialised countries need to
grow by at least three pct a year if the world debt is to be
brought under control.
    Eyskens added the Community wanted to give "certain nuances"
to the IMF report that would be constructive for dealing with
the Third World debt problem.
    However, Italian sources quoted Italian Treasury Minister
Giovanni Goria as calling it scandalous that the meeting here
did not include a discussion of what he called the problem of
falling world demand.
     He complained that West Germany was refusing to do enough
to boost demand while the United States, suffering from a
massive trade deficit, was unable to do anything in this
direction.

<TITLE>BRITISH MINISTER GOES TO TOKYO ASKING FREER ACCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Wise, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's corporate affairs minister left
for Tokyo saying he planned to present Japanese authorities
with a timetable for obtaining fair market access for his
country's goods and financial services.
    "I should be expecting a positive response to that
timetable," the minister, Michael Howard, said.
    He said the response was expected by next month, but
reiterated his belief that Britain would not have to invoke a
new law allowing a ban on Japan's banks and insurance firms
from trading in London if it failed to reciprocate in Tokyo.
    "I don't think that talk of a trade war is justified in any
event ... I think the Japanese are going to realize that it's
important that access should be available."
    The Conservative British government decided on Thursday to
bring forward legislation allowing the possible imposition of a
ban against foreign countries failing to allow reciprocal
market access. It is due to take effect in three weeks.
    Twenty-nine Japanese banks, nine insurance companies and 58
securities houses currently operate in London, while only five
British banks and eight securities firms are licensed in Japan.
    "We are sure reasonable men will come to a reasonable
solution," said a spokesman for &lt;Nomura International>, the
biggest of the Japanese securities firms in London which could
be targetted.
    The government decided to rush provisions of the Financial
Services Act into effect largely in response to the failure of
Cable and Wireless &lt;CAWL.L> to gain what it considers a
satisfactory stake in one of two consortia seeking to compete
in Japan's international telephone business.
    However, British economists say the use of financial
services countermeasures in the trade dispute would hurt
Britain more than Japan.
    The British press expressed concern that was Howard was
travelling with counterproductive or irrelevant ammunition.
    The Daily Telegraph commented that an unfortunate minister
was being "despatched to Tokyo armed with a pistol pointing at
his own foot." The Financial Times urged Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher to avoid provoking a "nasty backlash" from Tokyo.
    Japan appeared to be making no concessions ahead of
Howard's trip and Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon on
Friday sought to dispel some of the growing concern over the
dispute.
    "We don't want a trade war," he said. "We're not interested in
trade wars."
     But Channon made plain the government was determined that
British firms should have the same opportunites in Japan as
Japanese firms have in Britain and wanted a timetable set for
this purpose.

<TITLE>IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

<TITLE>CENTRE-RIGHT WIN GERMANY'S HESSE STATE POLL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 5  - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU)
and their liberal Free Democrat Party (FDP) allies today won
control of the central state of Hesse in state elections,
toppling the Social Democrats (SPD) who had governed the state
for over 40 years.
    The CDU/FDP coalition will have a two-seat majority over
the SPD and their Greens party allies in the new state
parliament. Earlier predictions forecast a hung parliament.
    The poll was the first major test of public opinion since
national elections last January returned Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn.
    Political commentators said the result was a debacle for
the SPD, which has been split by disagreements over the party's
future direction. It was also a rebuff for a unique coalition
the SPD had formed in Hesse with the anti-nuclear Greens
movement, which left-wing Social Democrats said could provide a
model for a similar alliance at federal level.
    Bonn Environment Minister Walter Wallmann, the CDU's
victorious candidate for the state premiership, told reporters
"Many traditional SPD voters voted for us because they did not
want an SPD that was under the influence of the Greens."

<TITLE>MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy in March improved at a
faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
product growth of about three pct.
    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
declining economy.
    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
declined slightly.
    New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
August 1984.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc &lt;PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a
healthy, if not substantial improvement."
    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
2.5 pct.
    The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
being significant.
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
    The monthly report is based on questions asked of
purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

in Amsterdam, its first office in continental Europe.
    BZW, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barclays Plc &lt;BCS.L>,
said in a statement the new company had been built on the
parent company's former Dutch subsidiary, Barclays Kol.
    The new company, &lt;Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland NV>,

and will develop a full range of investment banking services.
    It will initially employ 29, aiming to increase numbers to
35 by the year-end, it said.
    BZW said its parent Barclays Bank had subsidiary companies
active on the stock exchanges of Zurich, Milan and Paris which
BZW planned to use to strengthen its presence in continental
Europe.
    Commenting on the move, BZW chairman Sir Martin Jacombe
said while international deregulation had turned London, New
York and Tokyo into "pivotal points for trading across time
zones, firms like BZW that seek to serve the world-wide
financial community must have a presence in Europe, not just in
the U.K."
    BZW currently employs some 2,000 staff in its offices in
Britain, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York and Sydney.

<TITLE>BRITISH OPINION POLLS CONFIRM THATCHER LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Public opinion polls showing a surge in
support for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following
her trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call a
spring election, political analysts said.
    A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support for
the ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance of
Liberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party.
    Reproduced in a general election, the result would give
Thatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22.
    A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives
41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both opposition
groups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years.
    Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer a
series of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote,
securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcing
the date for the next election.
    Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lords
and one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out a
May general election, but left open the choices of June and
early autumn.
    The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit to
Moscow last week, was the first to show the party breaking
through 40 pct.
    The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip to
Moscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmed
a number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance had
overtaken Labour.
    Thatcher, currently serving her second consecutive term of
office, does not have to call elections until June 1988 but is
widely expected to do so within the next six months.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain
cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias
as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the
economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.
    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,
that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will
keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.
    Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to to
establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest
rates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy
said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy
investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this
environment until there is illumination of and confidence in
U.S. Dollar/trade policy.
    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,
highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if
currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas
economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.
    "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these
developments is likely to occur," Kaufman said.
    "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager
confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while
longer," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving
Securities Corp.
    However, Braverman said that, "from a longer term
perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying
opportunity."
    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on
unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury
bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and
Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.
    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long
bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.
Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.
    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a
similar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similar
closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,
however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the
yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.
    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said
that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach
nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.
    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have
spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and
they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to
persist over the next few months.
    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers
last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate
rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by
midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.
    "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the
rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen
since the start of the year," Held said.
    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.
    "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," said
economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up
interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar
and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm
the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.
    The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policy
stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm
domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of
causing a further decline in the dollar."
    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy
unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy
later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit
markets warranted a policy shift.
    However, economists generally believe that continued fairly
sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.
Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing
countries rule out any Fed policy firming.
    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at
last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.
    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little
impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on
Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.
    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.
Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic
indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A
Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first
quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP
growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.
    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are
expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its
directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
    Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
financing needed for the recapitalization.
    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck
said.
    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
incurred in connection with the recapitalization."
    He said the company does not usually release projections,
but has done so now beause of the significance of the
recapitalization.
    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
    As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that
certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
held by such interested stockholders.
    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash
distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size
of this deficit.
    But the company said its financial advisors have said they
believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should
have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to
finance its current and projected operating and capital
requirements.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;The Australian Gas Light Co> (AGL) said it
will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
oil and gas producer &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>.
    The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    &lt;Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about
three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response
urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
    AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible
notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
    It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice
Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
complementary with those of AGL.
    AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC
has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It
also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.

<TITLE>IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency said.
    Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around
one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,
the IEA said in its latest monthly report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average
consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for
these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
is about the same as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
March.
    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said.
    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
IEA said.
    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
Planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MANILA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine coffee exports are expected
to fall sharply due to a combination of the International
Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export
quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official
Dante de Guzman told Reuters.
    He said exporter registrations dropped from an average
weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports
in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total
about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.
     "Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,
it has become difficult to service exports," de Guzman said,
adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.
    Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about
one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June
from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.

<TITLE>LEADING COCOA PRODUCERS DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    YAOUNDE, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading cocoa producers will discuss
whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer
stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices
when they start four day's of talks here later today,
conference sources said.
    Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly
meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's
second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under
which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the
market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices.
    The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the
scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the
Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the
sources said.
    Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an
international cocoa research conference due to take place in
Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA
secretary general D.S. Kamga said.
    The 11-member CPA include the world's top three producers
of Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct
of world output.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE SEES NO TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan over
computer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.
    "I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn't
start a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive that
there won't be a trade war with Japan," Baldrige said in a
television interview.
    President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan's
alleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stop
selling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and to
open its own market to U.S.-made chips.
    Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, Baldrige
said Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps that
would lead to a trade war, largely because Japan itself would
have the most to lose in such a conflict.
    "Japan, I think will -- because they have the means to do it
-- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrial
trading power in the world they have to live up to their
responsibilities of free trade," he said.
    "I think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "It's not
going to be easy. But I guarantee you, we're not going to have
a trade war."

is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the
government's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5
pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.
    The report reviewing the country's economy in the first
three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was
provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the
period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.
    Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March
period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34
billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.

<TITLE>SUBROTO SAYS EXTENSION OF TIN PACT IS UNREALISTIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>An extension of the International Tin
Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed
to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told
reporters.
    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of
the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said
Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look
into how to replace the pact.
    But he said that given the present disagreement between
producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up
to the ITA.
    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension
of the ITA, he said, "No one will propose that. It's also
unrealistic to do so."
    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the
seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to
introduce a quota system which limited their exports and
consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.
    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.

<TITLE>OIL MARKET LIKELY TO REMAIN STABLE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said
he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market
because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a
price of 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "We are very confident that things will continue this way.
The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution
of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price," he said at a signing
ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement.
    He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its
agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to
firm slightly in the third quarter of the year.
    He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members
will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and
seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so
that members could produce more in the third and fourth
quarters of 1987.
    He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be
raised without undermining the 18 dlr target, or any indication
of which option he preferred.

will ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the arid
north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at
this time of the year," one official said.
    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and
failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her
remarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat
wave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the
south-west.
    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000
tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or
three weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of
rice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. It
revised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by
300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PRESS FOR FASTER JAPANESE, GERMAN GROWTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Administration, under
Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urge
Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to
stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading
industrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said.
    The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the
1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the
Paris Accord are more binding, they said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect
U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast
enough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to
bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the
meeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, the
sources said.
    "The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to
announce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan and
for the exchange markets in general," one of the sources said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, in
which West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will be
renewed by the industrial countries this week.
    Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven
will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made
setting up stimulus measures.
    The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further
substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with
Congress this year, the sources said.
    Washington would like its economic partners to establish
specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set
objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on
appropriate corrective action, they added.
    The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and
West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports
and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing its
demand for imports.
    But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be
far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck,
the sources said.
    Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall
against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over
semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain
Japanese electronic goods.
    One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent
soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings.
    Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed
particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said.

export a total of over 400,000 tonnes of seamless pipes in the
six months to end-September to China and the Soviet Union.
    Export prices for that period for both countries were set
100 to 150 yen per tonne higher than previous contracted prices
due to the yen's gains against the dollar, it said.
    Contracted export volume for China is likely to be over
200,000 tonnes against 350,000 for Oct 1986-March 1987, and
420,000 for April-Sept 1986, and for the Soviet Union over
200,000 tonnes. No direct Soviet comparison was available.

<TITLE>ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned
subsidiary of &lt;Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a
production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company
Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.
    It was the second production sharing contract signed by
Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.
    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence
of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil
production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.
    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln
dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two
years.
    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil
producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said
there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.
    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled
before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding
blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now
made seismic survey possible.
    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract
Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.
    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's
favour with operational costs deducted.
    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's
production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest
in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds
oil.
    Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for
refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a
day.

<TITLE>OIL PRICES SEEN HOLDING STEADY IN SECOND QUARTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jennie Kantyka, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese oil traders generally expect oil
prices to remain steady through June, when the next
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting
is scheduled to take place.
    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a
month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February
as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly
resist paying official prices, trade sources said.
    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to
stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.
    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,
mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its
15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members
would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.
    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output
targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.
    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to
demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting
from Japanese buyers.
    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels
to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.
    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its
ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd
compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East
Economic Survey estimated.
    "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to
destroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said.
    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at
discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of
Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have
not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.
    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20
to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude
under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be
weaker, traders said.
    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today
OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output
volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or
raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in
the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> said it
plans to seek a listing for its shares on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange later this year, subject to shareholder approval.
    The Tokyo listing will create a 24-hour market for the
stock. A company spokesman said the listing is expected in the
final quarter. Sponsorship for the listing will be disclosed
after shareholder approval is sought on April 29.
    Reuters "B" ordinary shares are currently listed on the
London Stock Exchange, while Reuters American Depositary
Shares, representing six "B" shares, are quoted on NASDAQ in New
York.
    The company said a Tokyo listing would also increase its
profile in Far Eastern markets. (Reuters has maintained a news
bureau in Japan since the 1870s, and now employs about 180
people at its offices in Tokyo and Osaka).
    Last month, Reuters announced plans jointly with Jiji
Press, the Japanese financial news agency, to display Jiji
services through the Reuter monitor and through the Reuter
Composite Information System, CIS.
    The Reuter Monitor Dealing Service was launched in Japan in
1986.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia has imported 12,000 tonnes of
refined sugar from Cuba to meet consumer demand in the province
of South Sulawesi, the head of the provincial food agency said.
    The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugar
refineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. It
arrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today and
will be distributed to markets in the province, the food agency
official said.
    Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year it
imported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola and
Brazil to bolster its depleted stocks.
    Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected to
rise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soared
because of rising demand by the food processing industry, the
head of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said.
    The government has forecast that sugar production in
calendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from
1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the target
could be met due to persistent post-harvest handling and
transport problems.

    Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic

    Saito said the government's package should include plans to

    Leading industrialised countries should also step up
concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates,
Saito said.
    The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation
of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic
Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Saito said Japan should stop paying only lip service to its
pledges to open its markets.
    The proposed measures should be undertaken by increased
fiscal spending, he added.

he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market
because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a
price of 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "We are very confident that things will continue this way.
The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution

    He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its
agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to
firm slightly in the third quarter of the year.
    He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members
will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and
seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so
that members could produce more in the third and fourth
quarters of 1987.
    He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be
raised without undermining the 18 dlr target, or any indication
of which option he preferred.

industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International

IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.

<TITLE>EC UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS SLIGHTLY IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community unemployment fell
slightly in February to just under 17 mln from 17.1 mln in
January, the EC statistic's agency Eurostat said.
    It said the fall came despite a bad winter in most of the
EC when seasonal factors could be expected to have had a more
adverse effect.
    However, the agency added, the long-term trend was
virtually unchanged stating that compared to February 1986 the
number of registered unemployed increased by 222,000.

<TITLE>JAPAN CONSIDERING BUYING U.S. SUPERCOMPUTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) is considering buying a U.S.-built
supercomputer worth three to four billion yen, but a final
decision and funding have yet to be determined, MITI said.
    The Cray II computer, made by Cray Research Inc &lt;CYR>,
would be used jointly by nine MITI research institutes in
Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo, a MITI official told Reuters.
    Its purchase would be in line with MITI's goal of boosting
imports, he said.
    Funds for the supercomputer are not included in the fiscal
1987 budget currently stalled in parliament.
    Funds could be provided in a supplementary budget likely to
be introduced this autumn, the official said.
    The U.S. Has strongly urged Japan to open its public sector
to sales of U.S. Supercomputers, and the complaint is a key
issue in current U.S.-Japan trade friction.
    One year before it was privatised in April 1985, &lt;Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) bought a Cray
supercomputer, an NTT official said, the only public sector
purchase of a U.S. Supercomputer to date.

<TITLE>CHINESE CROPS HIT BY FROST, SNOW AND RAIN IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China
suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of
unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.
    It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March
in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade
below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan,
making early rice sowing difficult.
    Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north
Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and
sowing, the paper said.
    The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in
areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.
    Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a
particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood
season, it said. It gave no further details.
    The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had
improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and
caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late
February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison.

unchanged from yesterday's 16.65 ringgit per kilo close after a
very brief trading session, dealers said.
    Buyers and sellers were evenly matched at the opening level
of 16.65 ringgit, and total turnover was 103 tonnes against 135
yesterday, they added.
    Buying at this level was mainly noted from the Japan, local

despite an easier European spot market.
    Some cash-strapped miners continued to sell, they said.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Profit-taking, domestic corporate
demand and limited Asian buying pushed the New Zealand dollar
back to just below 0.5700 U.S. Dlrs in late trading after it
had fallen more than one cent in the morning session, dealers
said.
    It finished at 0.5693/00 U.S. Dlrs against a morning's
quoted low of 0.5600/10, a 0.5720/30 start and a 0.5718/25 end
yesterday.
    Dealers said speculation that the Government's year-end
March budget deficit will be lower than expected and will bring
lower interest rates caused selling in nervous early trading.
    Most dealers said deficit figures for the 11 months to end
February, released during the session, were ignored by many
traders who believe the figures lacked meaning while the size
of the March tax-flow to Government is unknown.
    Dealers said trading will remain uncertain in the
short-term.
    "We hav+/Jkgressive rebound in thin trading and now the
market doesn't ?(e~hoing," one dealer said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait may re-register part of its
tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the
U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian
missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were
quoted by the New York Times as saying.
    The transfers would allow the country of registration to
escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier
declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an
admission of its need for protection, they said.
    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European
registries, the officials said.
    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the
Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.
Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a
naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as
saying.
    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran
and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian
attacks.
    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month
on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

its prime lending rate to 17.75 pct from 18.25, effective
tomorrow.
    The bank is the first to lower its prime rate below the 18
pct set by a few banks in the last few days in a continuation
of a downward trend which began late last month.
    Other prime rates range from 18.25 to 18.5 pct, with the
majority on 18.25.
    The bank said the reduction reflected the recent downturn
in money market rates, the improved economic outlook and
adequate liquidity in the second quarter tax rundown period.

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior
party official said.
    It also urged the government to concentrate in the first
half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record
proportion of the year's public works spending, he said.
    The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment in public works projects
presented by individual ministries, he added.
    But the LDP official said the government should not abandon
its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of
deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly
because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external
trade imbalance with the U.S., He said.
    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. This week when
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, he added.
    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's
Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed
supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than
August but before November.
    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed
reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29
for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.
    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN STOCKS CLOSE AT RECORD, BUT OFF HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian share prices closed at record
levels, boosted by continued demand for gold and blue chip
industrials, but fell from the day's highs on late
profit-taking, brokers said.
    Hectic overnight demand for leading mining stocks by U.S.
And European institutions spilled over into early trading here,
boosting prices to new highs. Investors, encouraged by the
record gain on Wall Street, a stronger local currency and
easier interest rates, snapped up leading industrials.
    But brokers said the late burst of profit-taking may signal
the end of the bull run.
    "But overseas people may disregard it tonight and see it as
a small buying opportunity," one broker said. By the close of
trading, the all ordinaries index had passed yesterday's record
close by 7.4 points to reach 1753.7, but was well off its all
time high of 1762.3.
    The all industrials index had gained 13.3 points to 2614.7
and the all resources 3.0 points to 1097.9. The gold index had
risen 44.7 to 3073.9, eclipsing yesterday's record close
3026.9.
    National turnover was a heavy 185.7 mln shares worth 353.1
mln dlrs, with rises outnumbering falls 389 to 353.
    Demand for gold mines was keen in the morning session but
eased during the afternoon. Investors sought out lower priced
issues after recent strong rises in the sector.
    ACM and Nuigini Mining gained 60 cents each to 8.10 and
7.90, Devex added 50 to 13.00, Consolidated Exploration and
Whim Creek 40 each to 6.90 and 11.00 and GMK 30 to 8.50.
    Among heavyweight miners, CRA closed 10 up at 7.80 after
reaching 7.90, Western Mining gained two to 8.12 after reaching
8.24 and MIM was unchanged at 3.10, off its high of 3.22. More
than 2.2 mln MIM shares changed hands.
    Resources leader BHP closed five cents up at 11.60 after
reaching 11.70. Bell Resources added 20 to 5.70 and Peko
Wallsend closed 40 up at 7.40 after reaching a high of 7.60.
    On the industrials board ANZ gained 30 to 5.70, National
Australia 20 to 5.50 and Westpac seven to 4.90.
    News Corp put on 10 to 24.30, Northern Star 10 to 3.45 and
Universal Telecaster's target Mackay TV was steady at 39.00 in
Brisbane. Telecasters North Queensland, of which Bond Media has
19.9 pct, rose 20 to 6.50 and Rockhampton TV 40 to 11.50.
    June share price index futures reached 1767.0 but fell
sharply to close 13.0 points off yesterday's close at 1735.5.

<TITLE>SWISS CONSUMER PRICES RISE ONE PCT IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the
year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and
against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal
Statistics Office said.
    In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in
February.
    The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in
February.
    The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected
rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household
goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.
    Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct
during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically
generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop
in imports.

<TITLE>DOLLAR CLOSES LOWER IN TOKYO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar closed lower on selling by
speculators and by institutional investors hedging currency
risks, dealers said.
    But the dollar's downward potential was limited by
persistent Bank of Japan intervention throughout the day.
    Some dealers started to sell dollars on speculation that
the Group of Seven meeting expected tomorrow in Washington is
unlikely to produce any significant new measures to stabilize
currencies, some dealers said.
    The dollar closed at 145.25 yen against 145.85/90 in New
York and 146.00 at the close here yesterday.
    The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in
New York.
    "The market consensus is that the G-7 meeting is unlikely to
change present underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar and
is likely just to reaffirm the February 22 Paris accord on
currency stability," a manager at a Japanese bank said.
    The dollar decline seem to come to a halt near 145.00 yen
after the Tokyo closing on shortcovering as many operators seem
unwilling to hold large positions ahead of the G-7 meeting,
some dealers said.
    The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in
New York.
    +The market consensus is that a G-7 meeting is unlikely to
change the underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar and is
likely just to reaffirm the February 22 Paris accord on
currency stability,+ a manager at a Japanese bank said.
    The dollar decline seemed to halt near 145.00 yen after the
Tokyo close on shortcovering, as many operators seem unwilling
to hold large positions ahead of the expected G-7 meeting, some
dealers said.
    The market is closely watching for a probable meeting
between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa later today ahead of the G-7
meeting, dealers said.
    Some dealers said mere reaffirmation of the Paris accord
would fail to stop the dollar's decline against the yen unless
the U.S. And Japan make progress in resolving trade and other
economic friction.
    Japan is expected to explain to the U.S. The guidelines of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic package to
stimulate domestic demand, a senior party official said.
    Operators generally see the dollar as still likely to head
downwards, probably sliding as low as 140.00 yen, despite the
G-7 meeting, dealers said.
    The dollar ended at 1.5130/35 Swiss francs against
1.5180/90 in New York and sterling finished at 1.6205/15 dlrs
against 1.6175/85.
    The firm tone of the pound is expected to remain for the
time being due to bullish sentiment, mainly on speculation the
ruling Conservative Party would retain power in expected
general elections, although the Bank of England may intervene
in the market, some dealers said.
    The Bank of Japan stepped into the market soon after the
opening and continued to intervene in the market to buy dollars
on a small-lot basis all day, dealers said.
    The mark/yen cross rate fell to 79.76 yen from 80.08 at the
close here yesterday.
    Spot dollar/yen volume through brokers was 6.56 billion
dlrs with a most actively traded rate of 145.55 yen compared
with 146.10 here yesterday.

<TITLE>STOCKS CLOSE AT RECORD HIGH IN HEAVY TOKYO TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share prices surged to close at a record
high in heavy trade as record gains on Wall Street yesterday
and expectations that Japan will take further steps to boost
its economy drew investors into the market, brokers said.
    The market average climbed 198.54 to 22,784.65, a record
closing high. The last closing record, set on April 4, was
22,738.67. Yesterday the market average lost 152.56.
    Advances led declines nine to eight in share turnover of
1.8 billion, the same as yesterday.
    Railway, securities house, rubber, oil, insurance, glass,
fisheries, machinery and food stocks led the advance.
    Brokers said a meeting of the Group of Five industrial
nations expected in Washington tomorrow is likely to lead to
further undertakings by Japan to stimulate domestic demand.
    Gas, some manufacturing, shipbuilding and other shares
related to the expansion of Japan's economy rose.
    A Nomura Securities broker said he did not expect another
cut in Japan's discount rate around the time of tomorrow's
talks but said the meeting would pressure Japan to import more
in order to ward off a further yen rise against the dollar.
    Communications, real estate, warehouse, rolling stock,
electric power and mining shares fell.
    The broad-based first section index rose 8.76 to 1,942.07
after falling 4.77 yesterday. The second section section index
gained 2.77 to 2,055.38 extending yesterday's 2.58 rise in
turnover of nine mln against seven mln yesterday.

<TITLE>DOLLAR OPENS EASIER IN QUIET FRANKFURT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened easier in quiet
trading and should stay firmly entrenched in its established
range ahead of this week's round of international finance
meetings, dealers said.
    "There is little turnover, no new ideas or impulses," a
dealer at a U.S. Bank said. "It promises to be a boring day."
    He said the dollar's range was expected to be 1.8075 to
1.8250 marks in the run-up to the International Monetary Fund
forum. The mark eased against some currencies on speculation
call money rates could fall further. Despite this, the dollar
opened lower at 1.8200/15 marks after yesterday's 1.8260/70.
    The Bundesbank is due to announce a securities repurchase
tender today. Money market dealers said funds may be allocated
at lower than the 3.80 pct the bank has set since its monetary
package at the end of January, softening the mark's undertone.
    Sterling opened at 2.951/955 marks, just under yesterday's
closing 2.954/958, and was seen firming further against major
currencies on a wave of popularity for British prime minsiter
Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservatives.
    "Sterling is looking very healthy at the moment," one dealer
said, adding that Japanese security houses bought pounds at the
start of trading.
    Dealers said the pound was also supported by an improved
British economic outlook and stability in the oil market.
    The Swiss franc continued to firm against the mark as
investors took advantage of the interest rate differential.
    It opened higher at 120.25/40 marks per 100 after
yesterday's last 120.10/25.
    The yen strengthened to open at 1.2520/2540 marks per 100
from yesterday's last 1.2490/2510 and the French franc was
unchanged at yesterday's last 30.04/07 marks per 100.
    The Belgian franc was stable at 4.828/830 marks per 100.
    The Danish crown started at 26.48/51 marks per 100, little
changed from yesterday's closing 26.49/51.
    Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from late yesterday,
with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-9/16 pct.
Six-month euromarks were stable at midpoint 3-7/8 pct.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Livestock Industry Promotion Corp
(LIPC) said that on April 28 it will import 7,515 tonnes of
beef for the first half of the 1987 fiscal year started on
April 1 under the simultaneous buy and sell tender system,
against 6,813 a year ago.
    The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading
houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The
tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency's beef
import share. Japan's beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at
93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.

<TITLE>ASIAN DOLLAR DEPOSITS CLOSE QUIETLY STEADY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asian dollar deposit rates closed
steady at opening levels in dull and featureless trading,
dealers said.
    They said most operators refrained from taking large
positions amid expectations that the group of seven would hold
currency talks on the sidelines of the International Monetary
Fund conference in Washington later this week.
    Short-dates were mostly steady at the outset and remained
unchanged in subsequent trading.
    Overnight, Wednesday/Thursday and week-fixed closed at a
common 6-5/16 6-3/16 pct.
    Term rates were little changed from earlier levels of 6-1/2
6-3/8 pct for one month, 6-9/16 6-7/16 pct for three months,
6-11/16 6-9/16 pct for six months and 6-13/16 6-11/16 pct for
one year.
    Asian dollar CD rates held unchanged at the morning's
levels in quiet trading, dealers said.
    One month closed at 6.45/35 pct, three months at 6.55/45
pct and six months at 6.65/55 pct.

<TITLE>YEN BOND FUTURES CLOSE SHARPLY HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yen bond futures prices closed sharply
higher reflecting the steep advance in cash bond prices on
purchases by end-investors and banks' dealing accounts, which
was followed by broker buying, dealers said.
    Key June ended at 110.68 against the 109.93 finish
yesterday after opening at 110.25 and rising to a high of
110.75. September ended at 109.40 against 108.74.
    Short-term rates dropped by one point in response to a
seasonal surplus of some 400 billion yen, money traders said.
City and trust bank dealing acounts actively bought low coupon
cash issues, accelerating the futures rally, dealers said.
    Most currency dealers here believe the dollar will remain
bearish despite the expected Group of Seven meeting in
Washington tomorrow.
    Should the dollar fall further, Japan might have to ease
its credit policy, which would lend support to the market, bond
dealers said.
    The unconditional yen call rate was 3.6250 pct today, up
from 3.6875 yesterday. The two-month commercial bill discount
rate was 3.8750 pct, up from 3.9375. The three-month
certificate of deposit rate, the representative open money
market rate, was 4.14/03, up from 4.18/06 yesterday.

<TITLE>U.S. DOLLAR CLOSES LOWER IN THIN HONG KONG TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Dollar closed lower after a
day of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of
the International Monetary Funds meeting in Washington this
week, dealers said.
    They noted the Group of Seven industrialised nations is
expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the
course of the IMF gathering.
    But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on
conviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during of
the meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's
145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90.
    Dealers said, however, the Japanese central bank bought
dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's
falls.
    The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early
1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close.
    It was under pressure also because most traders anticipated
the currency meeting to bring little surprise, dealers said.
    Sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95
and New York's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling
Conservative Party of Britain, dealers said.
    They said the pound gained ground on belief that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher will call an early general election
in June.
    But chartists said they expect strong resistance around
1.62 dlrs.
    Elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 Swiss francs from
New York's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 French
francs against 6.0745/75.
    Asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months
settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against Friday's close of 6-11/16
9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8.
    The Hong Kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80
peg with the U.S. Unit, finishing at 7.8015/35 against Friday's
close here of 7.8005/25.
    Interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move
to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct, effective
today, dealers said.
    The overnight rose to 4-1/2 1/4 pct from Friday's close of
four 3-1/2, while the three months was unchanged at 5-1/4 1/16
pct.

kilo down except nearby June which was unchanged at 125.2,
despite a higher Singapore market this morning, dealers said.
    Prices maintained their decline all day after opening
easier on sporadic stoploss selling due to the dollar's slight
drop against the yen but nearby and mid-term months recovered
slightly at the second afternoon session on small-lot buying in
thin trading.

<TITLE>STOCKS CLOSE WEAKER IN HONG KONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share prices closed weaker but well
above their lows on late bargain hunting in fairly quiet
trading, brokers said.
    The Hang Seng Index lost 15.29 points to end the day at
2,664.70 after falling more than 40 points in late morning. The
Hong Kong Index shed 10.69 to 1,713.81. Turnover was 657.5 mln
H.K. Dlrs against Friday's 694 mln.
    Brokers said sentiment remained bearish despite the late
recovery as the controversy surrounding the issuance of "B"
shares by major corporates still overshadowed the market,
adding that the local prime rate rise also dampened interest.
    Brokers said the market showed little immediate impact from
the suspension of trading in the shares of Wharf, World
International and Hk Realty despite speculation of a
reorganisation. On Friday, Wharf fell five cents to 8.60 dlrs.
    Cheung Kong and Hutchison ended unchanged at 41.75 and 51
dlrs on late support. Jardine Matheson shed 10 cents to 22.40
dlrs, Swire "A" 50 to 21.30 and Hk Bank 10 to 8.30.
    Hk Hotels rose 3.50 dlrs to 74.50 dlrs in active trading.
    The April Hang Seng Index Futures rose one point to 2,686
with 8,592 lots traded while June gained three to 2,733.

<TITLE>GERMAN BONDS BARELY CHANGED IN QUIET PRE-BOURSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prices of public authority bonds were
barely changed in quiet pre-bourse trading, with some foreign
investors taking profits but others opening fresh positions.
    Dealers said long maturities fluctuated between gains and
losses of around 10 pfennigs. Today's slight drop in the value
of the dollar and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Credit
markets had little impact on business here.
    Domestic investors remained sidelined ahead of the G-7
meeting this week. Dealers said today's quietness was also a
technical reaction to recent sharp gains.
    Mark eurobonds were little changed in thin trading.
    The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 10
pfennigs to 103.20, 103.45. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the
same address eased five pfennigs to 101.25, 101.50.
    Yields of mortgage and municipal paper eased one to two
basis points in thin trading. 10-year yields fell to 6.26 pct
from 6.28 and five-year yields declined to 5.13 pct from 5.15.
    In mark eurobonds, the 5-1/2 pct 1992 East Asiatic offer
was unchanged at 98-1/4, 98-1/2. Ireland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond
was steady at 98-1/2, 99.
    Syndication managers said one new issue could be launched
during the European afternoon.

<TITLE>TOKYO BOND MARKET CLOSES SHARPLY HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cash bond market closed higher in
active trade led by securities houses' speculative buying and
end-investor purchases of low coupon issues, triggered by
declines in short-term interest rates, dealers said.
    The yield on the 5.1 pct 89th bond of 1996 closed at the
low for the day of 3.905 pct against the 3.955 close yesterday,
and the 3.930 opening. The 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finished
at 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an opening
today of 4.100. Active dealing accounts of city and trust banks
heavily bought low coupon issues on the rate decline and in
expectation of a further fall, dealers said.
    The lingering bearish outlook for the dollar is sustaining
hopes of another drop in Japanese rates, regardless of what
emerges from the expected meeting tomorrow of the G-7 meeting.
    The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 was 95.26-28
in late Tokyo trade against the 96.04-06 New York finish.
    In the absence of retail participation, the key bond eased
on dealer position adjustments on the dollar's renewed weakness
ahead of the expected meeting.
    However, some bankers said Japanese investors would return
to the market, due to a wider Japan/U.S. Yield gap and demand
for liquidity, but only if the dollar stabilizes.

<TITLE>EQUITIES MAINLY HIGHER IN QUIET EARLY LONDON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares prices were mostly higher at the
oustset, bouyed by the latest opinion polls, one of which shows
the ruling Conservative party having a 13 point lead over the
Labour opposition party. Record closes on both the New york and
Tokyo stock exchanges supported market sentiment.
    Dealers expect the market to open around five to eight
points higher but then ease back should buying support fail to
emerge. The market appears fairly convinced of a Conservative
win in the next general election but is likely to be restrained
by uncertainty over its timing.
    Unilever rose 18p to 2,589 and British Telecom 2p to 254.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a
total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,300 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.
    Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day
repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct
one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount
rates today.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax
allocations to local governments and public entities.
    The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about
4,300 billion yen, they said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two British opinion polls showed the
ruling Conservative Party would retain power with a clear
majority in general elections.
    A poll for commercial television, conducted after Prime
Minister Thatcher returned from Moscow, this morning gave the
Conservatives their highest rating since they were re-elected
in 1983, with 43 pct of the votes, Labour 30 and the Social
Democratic-Liberal Alliance 26 pct.
    Another poll in the Times newspaper taken in 73 key
marginal constituencies, predicted a Conservative majority of
92 seats.
    Thatcher, does not have to call elections until June 1988.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar started lower after an easier
close in the Far East on selling amid continuing bearish
sentiment and despite Bank of Japan intervention, dealers said.
    But they said European markets were likely to be calm
today, with the dollar remaining in a narrow trading range
ahead of the Washington monetary talks.
    The dollar was quoted at an early 6.0565/90 francs after a
late 6.0710/30 range here and close in New York at 6.0745/75.
    The mark was quoted at an early 332.72/75 francs per 100
against last night's late 332.70/72 range.

<TITLE>DOLLAR STARTS EASIER IN LONDON, STERLING FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened easier after markets in
the Far East had sold it down for yen, defeating new attempts
by the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustained
currency intervention, dealers said.
    But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollar
sentiment remained bearish, especially against the yen, dealers
expected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Seven
finance ministers' meeting.
    Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showed
that the ruling Conservative party had increased its strong
lead, increasing the chances of an early election, they said.
    The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10
at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyo
after New York's 145.85/90.
    The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday's
close in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyo
after finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York.
    Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weighted
index, dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmer
at 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was also
firmer against the mark.
    The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530
in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after the
opening, trading quietly around 2.95 marks.
    Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding the
dollar, yen and mark, sterling looks strong and attractive on
due to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservative
party, relatively high interest rates and a strong economy.
    One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a
13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-point
lead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Another
forecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament.
    One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from a
Japanese institution earlier today.
    But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amid
wariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank was
thought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was not
sighted in the market today, dealers said.
    On the dollar, dealers said all eyes were turned to
Washington where finance ministers and central bank governors
of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meet
tomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currency
stabilisation pact.
    Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguely
worded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stability
and increased economic cooperation.
    This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollar
weakness, especially against the yen, with levels around 140
yen well within reach, some dealers said.
    "But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up with
some sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the market
after all," a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news that
Japan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget.
    A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic
Party said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline of
a reflationary economic package including a 5,000 billion yen
supplementary budget for fiscal 1987.
    The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against
1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs, down
from its European close of 6.0660/0710.

<TITLE>EQUITIES OPEN MIXED IN QUIET LONDON TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share prices opened mixed in relatively
quiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move
forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record
closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At
0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5.
    Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls,
one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM,
placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the
Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the
market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a
period of consolidation is due.
    An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today
which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling
Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party.
    Operators said although the market is generally convinced
the Conservatives will win the next general election,
uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an
unsettling influence.
    Among the leaders, ICI lost 2p at 1,333, Beecham 8p at 525
and Glaxo 4p at 1,484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 on
profittaking, dealers said.
    Dealers also said fears of a trade war with Japan, although
less acute, remain a nagging concern in the absence of fresh
developments
    Unilever gained 10p to 2,560, Dixons 4p to 373, British
Telecom a penny to 253 and Reuters 2p to 701.
    In lower oils BP shed 6p at 914 in the wake of news
yesterday that Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs
per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does
not already own. Shell declined 5p to 1,228.
    Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines.
Barclays eased a penny to 503, as did Natwest at 588.
    Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid
speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert
Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday.
Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer
for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds
rose one penny to 488.
    Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point, mostly
due to bullish sentiment generated by today's opinion polls,
dealers said.

<TITLE>DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN QUIET ZURICH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened slightly lower in quiet
trading, with dealers holding back ahead of the outcome of this
week's top-level international monetary talks in Washington.
    The dollar began here at 1.5128/5138 Swiss francs, down
from the previous 1.5185/5195 close and the 1.5180/5190 francs
in New York.
    However, dealers were sceptical that anything other than a
mere reaffirmation of February's Paris Accord was likely to
emerge from Washington. "The dollar is likely to stay stable or
drift slowly down," predicted one dealer at a major U.S. Bank.
    The Swiss franc was also slightly higher against the other
major currencies.
    Sterling began at 2.4526/4557 francs, down from the
previous 2.4547/4578 francs close, while the mark slipped to
83.09/19 centimes from 83.11/21 centimes.
    The French franc opened at 24.97/25.00 centimes from the
previous 24.98/25.02 centimes close.

    Silver began here at 6.74/79 dlrs an ounce, up 22 cents

However, it was not clear whether there could be a further

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR CLOSES ABOVE LOWER OPENING LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian dollar staged a strong
recovery on the local market after sharp overnight falls
offshore, as a weak U.S. Dollar and capital inflow into local
gold stocks and securities boosted demand, dealers said.
    The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs, after opening
easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar
still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of
0.7109/14.
    Traders are confident the local unit will return above
0.7100, and they regard today's fall as a correction in the
currency's recent uptrend.
    Traders said the Australian dollar, after trading around
0.7040/50 for most of the day, surged to its day's high in late
afternoon trading on Asian buying.
    They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the
Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin
volume.
    Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S.
Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also
provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia, the U.S.
Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25
close and New York's final 145.85/90.
    The U.S. Dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against
Tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in New York.
    The Reserve Bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points
from yesterday's 56.0. The U.S. Dollar average hedge settlement
rate was struck at 70.66 from 71.10.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SYDNEY FINANCIAL FUTURES CLOSE MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exhausted buyers and a late fall on the
Australian share market due to profit-taking led to a sharp
drop in share price index contracts on the Sydney Futures
Exchange, dealers said.
    Domestic credit futures were mixed, with 90-day bank bills
firming in line with easier physical yields as the dollar rose,
they said. Ten-year bond futures, however, were steady on the
day's open in line with little changed physical yields.
    Comex-linked gold futures were higher on rises in bullion,
while international credit futures were mixed in extremely thin
trade.
    June share price index futures closed at 1735.5 from the
day's 1754.0 open, well off yesterday's record 1748.5 close.
September was also well down on 1737.0 from 1763.0 after
finishing at 1746.0 yesterday. About 3,154 lots were traded.
    Dealers said the momentum of the futures market appeared to
be exhausted, with a return to bigger discounts now likely.
    Demand for gold and industrial stock continued to drive up
the all ordinaries index, which climbed 8.5 points to 1754.8,
although this was well off the day's highs after late
profit-taking.
    Easier physical yields, as a result of the firmer
Australian dollar, also saw rises in 90-day bank bill futures.
June contracts rose to 85.16 from the day's 85.00 open in
active trade after falling to a low of 84.96. September rose to
85.25 from 85.12 after finishing yesterday at 85.20. About
6,912 contracts were traded.
    Physical yields eased to 15.48/53 pct from 15.60.
    June 10-year bond futures, the only month to trade, were
steady on the day's 86.87 open after closing yesterday at
86.96. About 7,041 lots were exchanged.
    Physical March 1997 paper was 13.11/14 pct from 13.14.
    June Comex-linked gold futures finished strongly at 425.00
U.S. Dlrs an ounce from the day's 423.20 open and overnight
close of 422.60 in line with strong gains in bullion. Only nine
lots were traded.
    International credit futures were mixed, with June U.S.
T-bonds finishing lower at 97.27 from the day's 97.30 start,
well off the overnight Chicago close of 98.04. The contract was
untraded locally yesterday.
    June Eurodollars were untraded on a buy/sell quote of
93.31/36 after finishing at 93.35 in Chicago from a local close
yesterday of 93.36.

<TITLE>EUROBOND MARKET GENERALLY FIRMER WHERE CHANGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secondary sectors of the eurobond market,
where changed, were generally firmer in quiet morning trading
with attention again tending to focus on currencies other than
the dollar, dealers said.
    The sterling straight market opened with further gains of
1/8 or 1/4 point with sentiment boosted by the publication of
two more opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party
with a substantial lead over opposition parties.
    Dealers said operators seem a little more cautious this
morning since profit-taking is expected to emerge soon after
recent substantial gains.
    The dollar straight sector was little changed with
yesterday's gains on the U.S. Bond market being balanced out by
a slightly easier dollar. The market is now awaiting news which
may emerge from tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting in
Washington.
    "It's not often you can call the dollar straight sector a
backwater in the market but that's what it is at the moment," a
head trader at a U.S. Firm said.
    U.S. Treasury security trading was also quiet with retail
participation limited to enquiry, dealers said. The 30-year
long bond was quoted at 95-30/32 pct at 0845 GMT.
    The yen and Australian dollar sectors remained buoyant
although volume was lower than yesterday morning, dealers said.
Yen bonds were 1/4 to 3/8 point firmer with initial buying
coming from the Far East, dealers said.
    The market was boosted by a very firm Japanese bond market
in which the yield on the key 5.1 pct bond due 1996 dropped to
close at 3.905 pct compared with yesterday's close of 3.955
pct.
    In the Australian dollar market there was some retail
demand for zero coupon bonds, dealers said.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation
&lt;AVMD.PA> has suspended deliveries of its Mirage fighter jets
to Egypt because of payment delays on planes already delivered,
aircraft industry sources said. A Dassault spokesman could
neither confirm nor deny the suspension.
    The sources said the last six of 20 fighters ordered by
Cairo in 1983 were being held back, although the contract is
expected to be completed in the near future. Deliveries started
last year. They said the decision, taken in consultation with
the French government, would pressure Cairo to speed up
payments, delayed because of Egypt's foreign currency shortage.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE STOCKS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE STRONG TREND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tay Liam Hwee, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
will likely be used to raise more than 1.5 billion dlrs in
1987, continuing a long-term bullish trend that began last year
when about the same amount was tapped.
    Stock analysts and economists said the trend will be helped
by low interest rates and the government's plan to sell 380 mln
dlrs worth of shares in state enterprises each year for the
next 10 years, which should attract foreign interest.
    One foreign analyst said international fund managers are
increasingly attracted to Asian markets like Singapore.
    He said uncertainty over Hong Kong's future had helped the
flow of funds to Singapore over the last eight to nine months.
    Trade friction between Washington and Tokyo and the high
value of the yen had also diverted a trickle of funds from
Japan.
    But he added, "A slight trickle will have a large impact on
the local exchange."
    Economists said the inflow from foreign institutions is
difficult to estimate but it is increasing as the local
recession bottoms out with the help of reduced corporate taxes
cuts and of lower wage costs.
    Tan Soo Nan, director of the Development Bank of Singapore
Securities Ltd and a member of the exchange, said he expects
Singapore companies alone to tap around one billion dlrs this
year, but he warned there were some short-term risks.
    Corporate earnings in fiscal 1987 ending March fell short
of an expected 20 pct increase over 1986 and a major failure
would dampen sentiment, he said. He added the SES should admit
only companies able to sustain their earnings levels.
    But one foreign analyst said any slowing of activity would
be temporary and many investors are waiting for the results of
elections in Malaysia later this month.
    On the whole, Tan said, the long-term trend remains bullish
because of the economic recovery, the high growth potential for
the Asian Pacific region and the liberalisation of the Toyko
financial market.
    Tan said the introduction of the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Quotation System in January and the new
government securities market was in keeping with the global
trend towards debt securitisation and financial deregulation.
    Singapore's economic recovery will be more broad-based in
1987 and the exchange's strategy should be to build up
expertise in risk and fund management, he said.

<TITLE>SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTS MINISTRY CRITICISED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Communist Party has criticised
the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure
proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for
unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said.
    The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to
waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two
and a half years.
    The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised
since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev
last December.
    Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the
grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been
obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves.
    Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products
Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced
by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.
    Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been
drawn to Zolotukhin's attention and two of his deputies
reprimanded.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANK SUPERVISOR CALLS FOR WIDER REGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German banking regulations must be
expanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from new
financing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office President
Wolfgang Kuntze said.
    Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedging
price risks are not covered by current supervisory rules.
    Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have to
be disclosed.
    Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks can
continue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves against
their own holdings of securities.
    Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18
times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basis
and Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate and
currency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny.
    Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fit
present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary
political process of changing it, banking sources said.
    Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervision
can be found without having to change the law again.
    The risk structure in banking is moving away from the model
on which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said.
    Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net but
the safety net has become a little too small, he said.
    Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to banking
regulations, as these are still the subject of discussions
between the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank.
    He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for an
international harmonisation of supervisory law and the German
supervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation.
    Nor would it get involved in international competition on
minimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks from
competitive disadvantages, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Merriman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization
(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the
downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying
operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.
    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could
reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging
the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the
ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level.
    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last
month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer
stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.
    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer
stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used
to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average
above the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level.
    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of
the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New
York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per
tonne yesterday.
    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and
September, but these are set to change to July, September and
December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot
month, traders noted.
    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift
the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75
stg above May on the London terminal market.
    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the
higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the
indicator which governs his activities, traders said.
    "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the
implications of delaying until forward prices lift the
indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," an
analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.
    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000
tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach
this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an
ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market
watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent
forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln
to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to
three mln.
    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87
world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared
with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of
94,000 tonnes, traders said.
    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to
buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the
"must buy" level.
    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put
constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock
manager can remove cocoa from the market.
    The buffer stock system of price differentials set
according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from
non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,
dealers said.
    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is
nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.
    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as
Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa
can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer
stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.
    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member
cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are
pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.
    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from
quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact
on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for
this cocoa over futures.
    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg
from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer
stock buying, dealers said.
    "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will
provide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said.
    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer
stock were "all prognostication" and that no one could hope to
predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically
buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer
stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the
previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers
expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.
    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding
scheme as an additional market support mechanism.

<TITLE>CHEUNG KONG, HUTCHISON SCRAP "B" SHARE ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK>
and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK> have withdrawn plans for a
bonus issue of new "B" shares, chairman of both companies Li
Ka-shing said.
    He told a press conference in view of the difficulties the
companies have had with the stock exchange regarding the
issuance of shares with proportionally higher voting rights,
the issuance of such new shares cannot go ahead until the stock
exchange and the government clarified their positions.
    Cheung Kong and Hutchison on March 31 announced a
one-for-two bonus issue of new "B" shares whose par value will be
one-tenth that of existing shares, but with equal voting
rights. Their move followed similar plan by Jardine Matheson
(Holdings) Ltd &lt;JARD.HK> on March 27.
    The stock market fell sharply following Cheung Kong and
Hutchison's announcement as institutional investors reacted
negatively to the news.

<TITLE>LONDON COCOA HOLDS LITTLE CHANGED AT MIDMORNING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures were about unchanged from
last night by midmorning with near July trading at 1,319 stg
from 1,318 asked and a 1,324/1,318 high-low.
    Sterling's strength together with continued availability of
West African new crop physical offerings more than outweighed
any bullish impact from last night's higher New York market.
    Dealers said the market had been forecast to open as much
as 10 stg up, basis New York's close.
    The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325
French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was there at around
1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, they said.
    Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the
near future, the only other bullish feature is the lower trade
forecast for Bahia's temporao crop which was recently reduced
to 1.5/2.0 mln bags from 2.0/2.5 previously and compared with
initial expectations of up to three mln bags.
    Dealers said trade ideas are now pointing to the lower end
of the new forecast range although in terms of world production
this may well be evened out by a better than expected Ivory
Coast mid-crop.
    Terminal volume after 75 minutes was 248 lots including 76
lots crossed.

<TITLE>FRENCH TREASURY TO REPAY 680 MLN FRANCS OF DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French treasury has decided to repay
680 mln francs of debt issued before 1950, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Seven issues, accounting for 0.13 pct of total state
domestic debt, would be redeemed by the Caisse d Amortisement
de la Dette Publique, the national debt amortisation fund, a
Ministry statement said.
    The Ministry said the debt rationalisation exercise,
similar to one carried out in 1958 and 1959, would take out of
circulation old issues which were expensive to manage and
difficult to trade because of their highly complex structure.
    Technical details of the operation would be announced in
the next few days.
    The securities to be redeemed would be the three pct
perpetual rente, five pct perpetual rente, four pct 1941-1960
redeemable rentes, 3.5 pct 1942-1952 redeemable rentes, three
pct 1942-1955 redeemable rentes, three pct 1945-1954 redeemable
rentes, and 4.5 pct 1933-1960 redeemable treasury bonds.
    The ministry said the operation would mainly benefit
long-term holders of the issues, mainly small investors and
small communes.
    The issues were difficult to trade because they comprised
securities of variable nominal value, it noted.

in the wake of Wall Street's gains into record territory
yesterday, but gains were patchy with interest centered mainly
on the special situation stocks, dealers said.
    Allied Signal rose 1/2 dlr to 48-1/2 in the wake of news it

    Drug stocks showed gains of around 1/8 to 1/4 dlr as seen

    Operators expect Wall Street to open mixed to higher and
anticipate a period of consolidation after the recent firm

agreement to import 100,000 Mitsubishi small cars from &lt;MMC
Sittipol Co Ltd> of Thailand between 1988 and 1993.
    Chrysler Canada, a subsidiary of Chrysler Motors Corp &lt;C>
of the U.S., Will market the two and four-door cars in Canada
under the Dodge-Colt brand.
    The cars will be Thailand's first car exports.
    MMC Sittipol is a Thai-Japanese joint venture in which
Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> of Japan holds an estimated 47
pct stake. Its Thai partners are &lt;Sittipol Motor Co> and
&lt;United Development Motor Industries Co Ltd>.
    Officials of MMC Sittipol said Chrysler Canada currently
buys the same Dodge-Colt models from Japan where the strong yen
has sharply increased their production costs.
    They said Chrysler will from next year import the same cars
from Japan and Thailand which has a lower labour cost
advantage.
    The officials said Mitsubishi's decision to move its
production to Thailand also stemmed from the fact that Japan is
facing auto export quota restrictions to the Canadian market.

<TITLE>GREEK OFFICIAL SAYS AUSTERITY MEASURES PAYING OFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Economy Undersecretary Yannos Papantoniou
said the Greek economy was responding well to a two-year
government austerity program.
    He told reporters the evidence for this was in last year's
figures, which showed a drop in inflation from 25 pct to 16.9
and a reduction in the current account deficit from 3.3 billion
dlrs to 1.7 billion.
    Papantoniou said indications were encouraging that a target
of 1O pct inflation and a deficit of 1.25 billion dlrs would be
reached by the end of 1987.
    He predicted a "mild" recovery for the Greek economy in 1988
and said the government might be able to ease its tough incomes
policy, which has virtually frozen wages, and allow some
increases related to productivity.
    The austerity program, started by Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou's socialist government in October 1985, resulted in
a wave of strikes late last year and more industrial action is
planned by trade unions and workers in coming months.

<TITLE>GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRMS ON TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct,
back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earlier
today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new
securities repurchase pact, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct,
unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.
    Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in
line with market rates for call money.
    When this did not happen, because of more than adequate
liquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from the
market and use them to build up minimum reserves further.
    This resulted in the slight rise in call money.
    Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5,
averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month,
well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve
requirement, dealers said.
    There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was
offering more funds above the call money rate.
    But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility
was in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 today
after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.
    Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to
bid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billion
marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact
expires.
    One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.
    Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling
to cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its faster
and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might
have been associated with the new system.
    Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over
the next month lower the call money range from the narrow
3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently.

<TITLE>MALAYSIAN CRUDE PALM OIL FUTURES CLOSE OFF HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian crude palm oil futures
closed off the day's highs on late speculative selling
following talk that Pakistan passed on its tender for another
6,000 tonnes of RBD palm oil for second half April shipment
after buying the same amount yesterday, dealers said.
    A higher overnight Chicago soyoil futures close had
supported prices earlier, they said.
    June and July closed seven ringgit firmer at 746 and 742
ringgit per tonne respectively, while April and May were six
and five ringgit higher at 747.
    Turnover rose to 448 lots from 135 yesterday.

<TITLE>AGREEMENT REACHED IN GREEK ALUMINA DEAL WITH MOSCOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece and the Soviet Union have reached
agreement in Moscow on a joint venture for a 450 mln dlr
alumina plant in Greece, government spokesman Yannis Roubatis
said.
    Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the
plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina. More
details would be given later by Greek Industry Undersecretary
George Petsos, who was in Moscow.
    The project was due to start in 1986, but problems over
plans to sell some alumina to Bulgaria caused delays. The
Soviet Union, which was to take 400,000 tonnes, later agreed to
take the full production.

<TITLE>LONDON COFFEE HOLDS SMALL GAINS AT MIDMORNING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robusta futures held small gains of 12 to
five stg per tonne at midmorning in quiet trade, with second
position July traded up seven at 1,258 stg.
    Recent increased roaster demand and physical offtake of
coffee prompted light general buying, dealers said.
    However, some analysts believed prices should be weakening
due to the increase in Colombian, Brazilian and Mexican coffee
on the market after origin sales of the past week. They were
perplexed by steadiness in futures, they said.
    Trade houses rolled May positions into July and September
contracts. Volume was 969 lots including 520 crosses.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its troops had killed
thousands of Iranians in checking a new Tehran offensive on
their southern war front.
    The official Iraqi news agency INA quoted a correspondent
in the field as saying Baghdad's forces were pursuing
retreating Iranian troops.
    The agency said the al-Ghadeer Brigade of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards and the 21st Brigade had been destroyed in
the fighting.
    The INA correspondent said Iraqi troops had surrounded the
Iranians after the overnight attack was launched.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA said Iranian forces had killed
or wounded over 2,600 Iraqis in their new Karbala-8 offensive
and the thrust through Iraqi defences was continuing.
    Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who presided over a meeting
of his top military commanders in Baghdad two days ago, visited
the northern city of Mosul today to attend celebrations marking
the 40th anniversary of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party.
    Reuter correspondent Subhy Haddad reported from Mosul that
political observers there said Iran's offensive was timed to
coincide with the party's anniversary. But radio programs were
normal and there was no word in Mosul on fighting in the south.

total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,300 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.
    Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day
repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct
one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount
rates today.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax
allocations to local governments and public entities.
    The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about
4,300 billion yen, they said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank did not intervene as
the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243
yesterday, dealers said.
    Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the
European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting
of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs
ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.
    It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic
Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S.
Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.
    Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange
rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on
February 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators'
assumptions that a secret target level had been set.
    Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress
to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged,
"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the
dollar."
    One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended
easier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as being
negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that
comes out negatively then it means that the underlying
sentiment is negative," he said.
    Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's
undertone.
    Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan
to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by
institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.
    After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent
weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,
interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.
    "We can start to look at a point in time where the interest
shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the
other European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said.
    Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of
taking significant new positions during the Washington
meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German
Affairs group on international monetary issues later.
    The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set
a new securities repurchase tender to add money market
liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the
last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it
might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,
signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.
    Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said
the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A
monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and
capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate
oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.
    Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from
2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention,
brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480.
    The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from
120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after
30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per
100.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fire protection and security group
Wormald International Ltd &lt;WOIA.S> said British-listed &lt;Holmes
Protection Group Inc> has agreed to issue it with 6.15 mln
common shares of one U.S. Cent par-value at 1.72 stg each.
    The two groups have also begun exploratory talks on a
possible merger of the Holmes business with the compatible
businesses of Wormald, comprising some or all of its fire
protection and security businesses in the Americas and Europe,
Wormald said in a statement.
    The issue of shares in the New York-based Holmes is
conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting.
    Wormald said its stake will represent 9.99 pct of Holmes'
existing issued shares and 9.09 pct of the enlarged capital.
    The issue will raise 10.6 mln stg which will be used for
further development of the Holmes business.
    Wormald said the businesses of the two groups are largely
complementary in terms of both geographical spread and the
nature of their activities, with Holmes concentrating on
burglar alarms and Wormald on fire systems.
    Holmes's operations are concentrated in and around New York
amd Miami. It earned 11 mln U.S. Dlrs pre-tax in its last
reported full year, 1985, and 6.0 mln in first half 1986.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurodollar deposit rates were little
changed at midsession though some firmness was detected at the
longer end of the market prompted by a slightly weaker dollar.
    Dealers said the market remains extremely thin with no
important U.S. Economic indicators due until Friday. Operators
are awaiting the outcome of the Group of Seven finance
ministers meeting in Washington tomorrow to review their
February accord on currency stability.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony
before a Senate subcommittee later today on monetary policy
could provide some interest, dealers added.
    Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to
spot/next quoted at a common 6-1/4 1/8. One week gained 1/16
point to 6-5/16 3/16 pct.
    In the period rates, one to five months were unchanged with
three months at 6-9/16 7/16 pct. Six months to one year were
all 1/16 point firmer with sixes at 6-11/16 9/16 pct and one
year at 6-7/8 3/4 pct.

<TITLE>FRANC ZONE MINISTERS CALL FOR MORE AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance ministers from African countries
in the French franc currency zone called for more aid from the
international banking community at a meeting here last Friday,
the French finance ministry said in a statement.
    The talks, held to prepare for this week's International
Monetary Fund interim committee meeting in Washington,
underlined that a considerable decline in bank aid to
developing nations was a major source of worry.
    The ministers noted that this decline was contrary to
expectations on debt strategy which emerged from the October
1985 IMF general assembly in Seoul.
    "Even if to a certain extent the efforts of banks can be
helped out by those of private investors, the contribution of
the international banking community remains indispensable," the
statement said.
    They underlined the need, given present circumstances, for
a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to relieve
tensions on the exchange reserves of numerous developing
countries, the statement added without elaborating.

and a reduction in the current account deficit from 3.3 billion
dlrs to 1.7 billion.
    Papantoniou said indications were encouraging that a target
of 1O pct inflation and a deficit of 1.25 billion dlrs would be
reached by the end of 1987.

    It said in a statement the increase was exclusively due to
sharply higher use of rape products, which went up by 8.9 pct

    Use of soy products dropped 7.2 pct to 2.89 mln tonnes, it
added.

<TITLE>SUMITA SEES REAGAN BONDS FEASIBLE, SAYS NEWSPAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said
he would support the issuance of Reagan bonds, yen-denominated
U.S. Government securities, if it was considered appropriate, a
Japanese daily paper reported.
    The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview
"It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea," speaking in the
context of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting the
dollar's decline.
    Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were brought
up at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week,
the paper quoted him as saying "I will back it up."
    But Sumita said the market still has confidence in the
dollar, and one must be careful in associating the current
dollar decline with anything like a free fall, the paper said.
    In 1978, the administration of then president Jimmy Carter
floated government securities worth four billion dlrs in marks
and Swiss francs to try to halt the the dollar's depreciation.
    A Bank of Japan spokesman confirmed that the newspaper
report was basically correct.
    But a senior central bank official told Reuters that as far
as he knew, the idea was not being seriously considered now,
either in the U.S. Or in Japan.

<TITLE>STRONG QUAKE JOLTS CENTRAL JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>A strong earthquake registering 6.9 on the
open-ended Richter scale jolted central and northern Japan, the
Meteorological Agency said, but there were no immediate reports
of injuries or damage.
    An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake,
which struck at 9:40 A.M. (0040 GMT), as being under the sea
off Fukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo.
    On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richter
scale hit south-west Japan, killing two people.
    Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable
of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.
    The agency issued, but soon cancelled, a tidal-wave warning
for the Pacific coastline of central and northern Japan.
    The Shinkansen bullet train linking Tokyo and northern
Morioka stopped running. Services will be suspended for several
hours while workers check the tracks, railway officials told
Reuters.
    A spokesman for Fukushima police told Reuters they had not
received any damage reports, even from the coastal town of
Onahama, which registered the maximum intensity.
    He described the shaking as very strong.

<TITLE>KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait may re-register part of its
tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the
U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian
missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were
quoted by the New York Times as saying.
    The transfers would allow the country of registration to
escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier
declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an
admission of its need for protection, they said.
    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European
registries, the officials said.
    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the
Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.
Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a
naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as
saying.
    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran
and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian
attacks.
    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month
on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Chase-AMP Bank Ltd> said it will lower
its prime lending rate to 17.75 pct from 18.25, effective
tomorrow.
    The bank is the first to lower its prime rate below the 18
pct set by a few banks in the last few days in a continuation
of a downward trend which began late last month.
    Other prime rates range from 18.25 to 18.5 pct, with the
majority on 18.25.
    The bank said the reduction reflected the recent downturn
in money market rates, the improved economic outlook and
adequate liquidity in the second quarter tax rundown period.

<TITLE>EC INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH HALTS IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Industrial production in the European
Community (EC) in January showed no growth compared with
January 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in a
report.
    It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,
stood at 103.9 in both months.
    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been
due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the
EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.
    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures
are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with
the year-earlier period.
    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about
1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12
months ending last June, the office said.

<TITLE>LONG DEBT FUTURES TURN EASIER IN LIFFE MORNING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Long debt futures turned easier in late
morning on the London International Financial Futures Exchange
(LIFFE) as the dollar and sterling softened, dealers said.
    Long gilt futures had a good start with an opening range of
124-10/32 to 124-14/32 from 124-7/32 overnight as sentiment was
boosted by two opinion polls showing a comfortable lead for the
ruling Conservatives.
    They made a high of 124-19/32 but met chart resistance. A
wave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 GMT, driving
the price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 was
breached.
    This coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade-
weighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night.
    At the same time, the dollar was dipping below 145 yen
after a night of pressure in the Far East.
    June T-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settled
around 97-21/32 at 1015 GMT after opening 8/32 easier at
97-26/32.
    Analysts said the markets remained cautious because of a
series of talks in Washington this week between finance
ministers of industrial countries.
    June Eurodollars started at 93.33, a technical support
point, and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night.
    Analysts said sterling contracts would have difficulty
advancing beyond current levels if the market discounts the
Conservative victory predicted by the opinion polls.
    Other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the
2.96 mark ceiling, which could indicate the Bank of England is
trying hard to keep a lid on the U.K. Currency.
    Also, market talk of a further base rate cut has died down,
although another cut was virtually discounted by mid-March.
    June short sterling futures were little changed in early
trading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73
by late morning. Interbank interest rates were unchanged.
    June FT-SE 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to
203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of
202.20 late morning. The underlying index opened only slightly
weaker and losses extended to 11 points by 1030 GMT.
    Long gilt options featured 465 June calls at 125, 127 at
130 with 118 June puts at 122 and 195 at 126.

<TITLE>DOLLAR STEADY NEAR LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar was steady near lower opening
levels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expect
the U.S. Currency to move significantly before the series of
high-level monetary meetings starting today in Washington.
    Sterling trading was equally quiet.
    Bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggesting
Britain's ruling Conservative party had increased its lead over
the opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-selling
intervention by the Bank of England, dealers said.
    The dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against
1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in Europe last night.
    The dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen, virtually unchanged
from its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday's
European closing 146.00/10.
    It briefly dipped below 145 yen, to a quoted low of 144.85,
but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels,
dealers said.
    Trade-weighted, sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975
value, unchanged form the opening but one basis point below
yesterday's close. The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and
1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and
1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73.
    Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europe
after a large selloff against the yen in the Far East, which
sustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earlier
today.
    They said that in the absence of other factors,
participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Group
of Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington
today, and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow.
    Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little more
than a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectives
of stable currency markets and economic policy coordination.
    The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22
to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and several
participant central banks have since intervened to keep
currencies within narrow ranges against each other.
    But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions between
the U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test the
agreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen.
    Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking by
Japan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reduce
trade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar would
resume its fall, especially against the yen.
    Without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appears
set to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term,
with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealers
said.
    Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise with
the U.S. On economic policy issues.
    Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in the
Japanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party today announced an outline agreement on economic
reflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budget
for 1987, the dealers said.
    Some dealers said the market could get some impetus from
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies on
Third World debt problems before the Senate banking committee
later today.
    Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidence
the ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in an
election which they said would likely be called for June.
    One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43
pct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast a
Conserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.
    But wariness of Bank of England sterling-selling
intervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound
much higher, dealers said.
    Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to have
intervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had
not detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sighted
Bank intervention today.
    The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs at
midsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90
European close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against
6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close.

<TITLE>MOULINEX NOMINATES NEW GENERAL MANAGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Electrical appliance maker Moulinex
&lt;MOUP.PA> said industrial director Roland Darneau had been
nominated as general manager of the group.
    Darneau's appointment, if confirmed by the Moulinex board
on April 16, effectively names him as successor to 87-year-old
Moulinex group President Jean Mantelet, industry analysts said.
    The company declined to comment on press reports that
Moulinex recorded a loss of between 200 mln and 250 mln francs
in 1986, or that this would be offset by Mantelet personally
injecting 200 mln francs.
    Company sources said earlier this year that the group was
likely to increase its net consolidated losses to 200 mln
francs in 1986 from 34.9 mln in 1985.
    Moulinex has implemented a restructuring programme,
including plans to cut jobs, to improve its results.
    The group is currently looking for a possible partner after
a merger with &lt;Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Fell through.
    Scovill sold its 20 pct stake in Moulinex at the beginning
of March.

<TITLE>GERMAN BONDS END QUIET BOURSE LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prices of public authority bonds ended
a quiet bourse session lower, with domestic investors taking
profits in a technical reaction to recent strong gains.
    Dealers said long maturities dropped as much as 50 pfennigs
but most paper lost around 20 pfennigs. Foreigners, which had
been buying and selling West German public authority bonds in
pre-bourse business, remained sidelined during bourse trading.
    Today's slight dollar drop and yesterday's modest gains on
U.S. Credit markets had little impact. Dealers said this week's
G-7 meeting in Washington made investors wary and led to the
squaring of some positions.
    Most dealers said underlying sentiment for bonds remained
favourable and there were some speculations global interest
rates could fall further in the not too distant future.
    The Bundesbank bought 109.9 mln marks worth of public
authority paper here after selling 80.7 mln yesterday.
    The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 40
pfennigs to 102.90, 103.15. The 5-3/4 pct 1997 bond for the
same address also shed 40 pfennigs to 100.90, 101.15.
    In contrast to the public authority bond sector, prices of
mortgage and municipal paper firmed in active business, dealers
said. 10-year yields fell two basis points to 6.26 pct.

    Mark eurobond prices eased 1/8 point in thin trading, with
domestic and foreign investors remaining largely sidelined.
    The 5-1/2 pct 1992 East Asiatic bond was quoted unchanged
against yesterday at 98-1/4, 98-1/2. Ireland's 6-1/2 pct 1997
bond was steady at less 1-3/4, less 1-1/2.
    Syndication managers said one new issue could be launched
during the European afternoon.
    But primary activity was expected to remain subdued in
April. Only two or three further issues were expected during
the first half of the month. The second half is shortened by
the long Easter holiday weekend.

<DATELINE>    ROME, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Italian Treasury said it would offer
2,500 billion lire of indexed government discount certificates
at rates slightly higher than on the preceding issue.
    The seven-year certificates carry a first-year coupon,
payable April 21 1988, of 4.86 pct, identical to that on the
preceding issue in March.
    They will be offered at a base price of 72 lire, down from
74 previously, for an effective net annual yield on the first
coupon of 10.15 pct against 9.66 in March. Yields after the
first year will be linked to rates on 12-month Treasury bills.
    Subscriptions to the issue close April 17.

<TITLE>SHARE PRICES NEAR DAY'S LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Equities steadied near the day's lows at
midsession after a hesistant start mainly due to lack of
interest in quiet trading conditions.
    Dealers said most of the trading appeared to be
inter-professional, highlighting the market's cautious approach
in the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latest
opinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that the
Conservatives will win the next general election, but the
uncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettling
factor.
    At 1141 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 10.6 down at 1.979.0.
    In a poll conducted for television programme TV-AM showed
the Conservative Party 13 points ahead of the Oppsition Labour
Party. An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today,
which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the
Conservative party a lead of six points over Labour.
    Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan,
although less pronounced, provides a further note of caution,
dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said it
will help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to
facilitate foreign membership.
    The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despite
gains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stock
exchanges further underlined market nervousness.
    ICI fell a penny at 1,334, Glaxo 8p at 1,480, Beecham 12p
at 521, BPB 10p to 660 and P and O 3p to 617. Wellcome shed 23p
to 397 on profittaking after adverse press comment on the side
effects of its "Retrovir" aids drug, dealers said. London
International, makers of condoms, gained 14p at 302 in
contrast.
    Among few other gains Jaguar rose 12p to 587 mainly on U.S
demand, dealers said, Unilever added 8p at 2,578, Plessey 2p to
243, as did Reuter at 701p.
    In lower oils BP shed 13p at 907p after news yesterday
Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share
tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not
already own. Shell lost 10p at 1,223.
    Banks mostly showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny
to 503 as did Natwest at 588. Standard Chartered lost 4p to 821
after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said
Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his
stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is
widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one
year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds was one penny higher at
488.
    Extel further declined today, losing 28p to 462 in the wake
of news yesterday British Printing and Communications Corp and
its associates said they would not be making a bid for the
company.
    In mixed insurances Sun Life gained 7p at 1,085, Prudential
Corp rose a penny  at 833 while Royal declined 4p to 945 as did
Sun Alliance at 828.
    The market now awaits Wall Street's opening, which is
expected mixed to higher, for further direction. At 1151 GMT
the FTSE 100 share index was eight points down at 1,981.0,
lifted by some selected bargain-hunting after touching 1978.7
earlier.

rules. (NRCJ 1017)

<TITLE>LONDON SOFT FUTURES ADOPT NEW CLEARING PROCEDURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>London's soft futures markets, namely
cocoa, coffee and sugar, are adopting with immediate effect a
uniform presentation on their respective open positions
referring to previous day's trading figures, a spokeswoman for
the London Commodity Exchange (LCE) said.
    The figures represent total clients' long positions as well
as short positions, plus the net house positions as submitted
by all members for each delivery month, she said.
    As a result, figures will differ from those previously
published but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare more
favourably with other international markets, she added.
    Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure last
October, which incorporated a system of "mark-to-market',
figures as published bore little relationship to the true open
position, the spokeswoman said.
    The open position for business done up to the previous
trading day is prepared daily by the International Commodity
Clearing House (ICCH) and then posted on the various market
notice boards.

<TITLE>DENMARK PLANS TO END SALES TAX ON SOME ITEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Danish government said it planned
tax changes to discourage people making shopping trips to West
Germany and other countries where consumer durables are
cheaper.
    Tax Minister Isi Foighel told journalists the government
will present a bill abolishing sales tax - generally 10 to 20
pct - on radios, record players, loudspeakers, video tapes,
vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and small household items.
    The annual loss in revenue of 275 mln Danish crowns will be
made up by higher duties on four-wheel drive vehicles and small
pick-up vans, which will be taxed in future as commercial
vehicles under two tonnes.
    Foighel also announced small reductions in the concessions
for duty-free imports to compensate for a strengthening of the
Danish crown.
    He said maximum concessions would apply in future only to
travellers out of the country for more than 24 hours. Those
returning within that period will have to prove to customs that
they have been on more than a shopping trip.
    The tax move follows an official report showing that total
border imports, about three billion crowns in 1985, rose by
some 600 mln crowns in 1986, a trend which has alarmed Danish
businesses, particularly in Jutland areas bordering Germany.

marks to 687 and Commerzbank lost 9.20 to 278. Bayernhypo fell
15 marks to 449 after news yesterday it raised 1986 parent net
profit to 200.6 mln marks from 184.1 mln and left its dividend

    In chemicals BASF lost 5.70 to 276.10, but its mostly owned

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - NARROW RANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>After a few days of volatility, the
credit markets show signs of settling back into the
frustratingly narrow ranges that prevailed for much of the
first quarter, economists said.
    Friday's weak employment data for March braked an ascent in
bond yields before the 30-year yield could reach the
psychologically important eight pct level.
    But, with question marks hanging over the strength of the
economy and, more critically, the value of the dollar,
economists said the market remains fragile and will not quickly
recoup the ground lost in the past two weeks.
    The 30-year bond yield closed Monday at 7.84 pct, down from
7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct,
but trading was lackluster.
    "People are sitting on the fence, they don't really know
what to do," said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. "Our retail accounts are not committing themselves either
way."
    No economic indicators are due today, but the markets will
hear Congressional testimony from Fed chairman Paul Volcker at
1000 EDT (1400 GMT) and will be alert for the possibility of
another outright purchase of securities by the Fed.
    The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at this
time of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-up
of Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date.
    The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill
"pass" last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs of
notes and bonds, and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buy
coupon securities today or Wednesday.
    The Fed will not buy bills since they are already in
relatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns in
recent weeks, she argued.
    "They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter,"
Ramirez said, noting that the Treasury has been able to reduce
the size of its regular bill auctions because of strong tax
revenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginning
of the year.
    Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conduct
back-to-back coupon "passes", most economists still expect the
Fed to buy bills this week instead of bonds and notes.
    After trading late yesterday at 6-1/8 pct, Fed funds were
indicated by brokers to open at 6-1/8, 6-1/4 pct.

<TITLE>REUTER COMMODITIES NEWS HIGHLIGHTS 1200 GMT - APRIL 7</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization buffer stock
could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world
cocoa prices when it begins operations in the next few weeks,
cocoa traders said. They believed buffer stock purchases could
reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
significantly. (XYZS 1019) Cocoa futures were about unchanged
from last night by midmorning. Sterling's strength together
with continued availability of West African new crop physical
offerings more than outweighed any bullish impact from last
night's higher New York market, dealers said. (CKLB)
    LONDON - Dry cargo futures on BIFFEX dropped sharply in
morning trading as further profittaking emerged after the
recent rise in values, dealers said. Near July fell 45 points
and near limit in initial activity, but later recovered. (OFLB)
    ATHENS - Greece and the Soviet Union have reached agreement
on a joint venture for a 450 mln dlr alumina plant in Greece,
government spokesman Yannis Roubatis said. The USSR agreed to
buy the plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of
alumina. (XZAG 1103)
    LONDON - Cargill U.K.'s oilseed processing plant in
Seaforth is still strikebound, a company spokesman said. (XYZJ

    LONDON - The cocoa, coffee and sugar markets are adopting
with immediate effect a uniform presentation on their
respective open positions referring to previous day's trading
figures, the LCE said. (XZAP 1151)
    MOSCOW - The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the
country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper
grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and keeping
unsatisfactory books, Pravda said. The party daily said that
losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3
mln roubles over the last two and a half years. (XYZQ 1012)

<TITLE>VW CURRENCY DEPARTMENT FORMER HEAD ARRESTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUNSWICK, West Germany, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The former chief of
foreign exchange at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> has been arrested in
connection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker a
quarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor Carl
Hermann Retemeyer said.
    He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrested
yesterday for suspected embezzlement.
    "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evaded
justice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for his
arrest," Retemeyer said.
    VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of the
suspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gave
him leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.
    VW said last month computer programs were erased and
documents faked in the possible fraud, in which it believes
transactions meant to protect it against foreign currency
losses were not completed.
    Retemeyer said "We are still investigating a larger circle
of people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"
    He would not comment whether other arrests could be
expected.
    The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-up
with the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board member
in charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility for
the affair.
    Retemeyer said last month he wanted to question
Frankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be able
to give more details.

<TITLE>LONDON SUGAR DOWN 1.40 TO 2.00 DLRS BY MIDDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Raw sugar futures were near session lows
by midday, sustaining losses of 1.40 to 2.00 dlrs a tonne from
last night's slightly easier close, dealers said.
    Volume was 484 lots.
    Lack of follow-through after yesterday's midsession
steadiness played a part in the decline which saw light
liquidation and technical selling, dealers said.
    There was no fresh physicals news although there are whites
buying tenders tomorrow by India and Syria which will coincide
with the weekly export tender by the European Community (EC).
    Pakistan tenders on Saturday for 100,000 tonnes whites.
    Near Aug terminal was finally quoted at 154.40/154.60 dlrs
(bid-asked) from 155.80/156 last night and a session high-low
of 155.80/154 dlrs.
    London Daily Raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 fob
and 171 (105.50 stg) cif.
    The Whites price was down 2.50 dlrs to 190.

<TITLE>CBS &lt;CBS> TO PAY WYMAN 400,000 DLRS EVERY YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBS Inc said under its settlement with
former chairman and chief executive officer Thomas Wyman, it
will pay him 400,000 dlrs a year for life.
    CBS, in a proxy statement, said Wyman can also elect to
receive either 3,800,000 dlrs in 10 annual installments or a
lump sum of 2,800,000 dlrs next January Two.
    The settlement with Wyman called for his employment to
continue through 1986, and he was paid 809,654 dlrs in base
salary and 293,859 dlrs in bonuses for the year, CBS said, with
the bonuses paid in February 1987.
    Wyman resigned on September 10 amid opposition from the
company's two largest shareholders, Loews Corp &lt;LTR> chairman
Laurence A. Tisch and retired CBS chairman William S. Paley.
Tisch was then named chief executive officer and Paley returned
as chairman.
    The proxy statement said Tisch will receive a salary of
750,000 dlrs for serving as chief executive this year.

<TITLE>MORE RAIN IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Kansas City, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Weather Service said a
storm, centered off the east of Massachusetts early this
morning, continued to produce rain across New England, and as
far west as Michigan, Ohio and west Virginia. Some areas in the
northeastern U.S. have yet to see the sun this month.
    A flood warning remains in effect for small rivers in
southern New Hampshire and extreme southwestern Maine. A flood
warning is also in effect for interior Rhode Island, and
central and northeastern Massachusetts.
    A flood watch covers much of the rest of Massachusetts,
eastern interior Connecticut and coastal Rhode Island, along
with the southern half of Vermont, the White mountains of New
Hampshire and much of southern Maine.
    The storm off the Atlantic Coast has been very slow to move
out to sea, and rain is likely to continue in northern New
England into Wednesday.
    Cool and wet weather has also prevailed in the lower Rio
Grande Valley of Texas so far this month.
    A few light rainshowers were over the lower Rio Grande
Valley early this morning. Rainshowers were also widely
scattered over the middle Mississippi Valley.
    A cold front was bringing cloudy skies and scattered
rainshowers to the northwestern U.S.
    Skies remained clear in the north central U.S. Unseasonably
warm temperatures prevailed across the north central states
Monday afternoon. High temperatures in northern Minnesota were
warmer than those in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
    Temperatures were in the 30s F early this morning in the
central and southern Rockies, and the southern and central high
Plains.
    Temperatures were still in the 60s in south Florida,
southern Arizona and southern California.

<TITLE>STRONG QUAKE JOLTS CENTRAL JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>A strong earthquake registering 6.9 on the
open-ended Richter scale jolted central and northern Japan, the
Meteorological Agency said, but there were no immediate reports
of injuries or damage.
    An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake,
which struck at 0940 hrs (0040 GMT), as being under the sea off
Fukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo.
    On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richter
scale hit southwest Japan, killing two people.
    Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable
of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.
    The agency issued, but soon cancelled, a tidal-wave warning
for the Pacific coastline of central and northern Japan.
    The Shinkansen bullet train linking Tokyo and northern
Morioka stopped running. Services will be suspended for several
hours while workers check the tracks, railway officials told
Reuters.
    A spokesman for Fukushima police told Reuters they had not
received any damage reports, even from the coastal town of
Onahama, which registered the maximum intensity.
    He described the shaking as very strong.

ruling Conservative Party would retain power with a clear
majority in general elections.
    A poll for commercial television, conducted after Prime
Minister Thatcher returned from Moscow, this morning gave the
Conservatives their highest rating since they were re-elected
in 1983, with 43 pct of the votes, Labour 30 and the Social
Democratic-Liberal Alliance 26 pct.
    Another poll in the Times newspaper taken in 73 key
marginal constituencies, predicted a Conservative majority of
92 seats.
    Thatcher does not have to call elections until June 1988.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - FOREIGN BANKS IN GERMANY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Foreign banks in West Germany are
reassessing their positions after a number of changes in the
markets and the regulatory environment that have dampened a
once-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here.
    Banking sources said the most important changes were plans
to bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios, the
first such move in a major financial centre. This could place a
serious burden on several foreign banks, particularly those
active in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks had
much lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks.
    Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank
and the banking supervisory office over bringing securities --
primarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios
were in progress.
    Although no date had been set for imposition, banks as
early as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985
rules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity
and reserves.
    Although other national regulatory authorities are known to
be considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation
of debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with its
tradition of prudence, may be the first.
    Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association,
told Reuters, "It's not a positive sign. It could cause certain
people who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as
attractive to get in now."
    Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on
holdings in mark securities to other centres which had less
stringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added.
    But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other
practical problems as well. These included,
    -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to
make an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax.
    -- signs that London's "Big Bang" may have deeper
implications for German securities trading than first thought.
    -- difficulty in finding experienced securities
professionals to staff new subsidiaries.
    -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is
forcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities.
    -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market
share by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks.
    By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the
initial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition
government, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished.
    The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by a
non-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds.
    This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instruments
such as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securities
business firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside from
this, London was more active than domestic houses had expected.
    Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors often
preferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up --
with City market makers who could absorb at least some of the
paper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impact
on the share price.
    Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the
exchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs.
    Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member
Michael Zapf said London's share of German securities business
done was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh
whether establishment costs involved were worth the returns.
    Additional signs that London market makers may move into
secondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said.
    Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark
securities trading entirely to newly established, mainly
Frankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said.
    The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also
effectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper
market in certificates of deposit or commercial paper.
    Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particular
were hoping experience in these would provide the lever to
prise open tight credit relationships between companies and
their domestic "house" banks.
    At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastest
here. A unit of Salomon Inc &lt;SB.N> began last summer and Morgan
Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS.N> is currently fitting out offices,
probably for a summer start to business.
    A unit of &lt;Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin
operations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER.N>
and Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing
conversion of current, small operations to full-standing units.
    But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced
personnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big three
Swiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half
1986, have been steadily building up securities departments,
taking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors.
    The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AG
and Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit.
    Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial
activities and shut down German branch offices on orders from
head office. In the competitive environment, return on assets
employed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said.
    But the weakening attraction of "Financial Centre Germany"
was unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full
subsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark
eurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987.
    Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd &lt;DIKB.T> and
Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> move in, competition for business,
for staff and even for premises would soar, sources said.

<TITLE>U.S. AID CHIEF TO BE NAMED TO TOP TREASURY POST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan will shortly
nominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World
development, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the
Department of the Treasury, administration sources said.
    They said the White House was expected to announce
McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy
Treasury scretary later this week.
    The nomination is subject to Senate approval.
    McPherson has headed the Agency for International
Development (AID) since 1981. As Treasury Secretary James
Baker's chief assistant, he would be expected to work closely
on international economic policy, including the major problems
of the Mexican and Brazilian debts.
    McPherson, a lawyer, worked in the White House under
President Gerald Ford, after serving as a corporate tax
specialist for the Internal Revenue Service.
    He also spent two years in Peru as a member of the Peace
Corps.
    Darman, who was considered to have played a central role in
achieving agreements among industrial countries on
international economic policy, will leave the Treasury on April
13 to join the Investment Banking Group of Shearson Lehman
Brothers.

<TITLE>BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Petroleum &lt;BP.L> Co Plc's
refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion
and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back
in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.
    He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500
barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the
North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January,
will not be completed before the end of April.
    He said the refinery had been closed for longer than
originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being
carried out prior to restarting.
    The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed,
caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000
hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be
out of operation for several months. The remainder of the
refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was
undamaged.
    He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while
the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.
    In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an
explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENT BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior
party official said.
    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's
Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed
supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than
August but before November.
    It also urges the government to concentrate in the first
half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record
proportion of the year's public works spending.
    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. this week when
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the
meetings with the IMF and G-7 ministers, Ito added.
    The LDP suggested the government review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment in public works projects
presented by individual ministries, Ito said.
    But the LDP official said the government should not abandon
its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of
deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly
because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external
trade imbalance with the U.S., He said.
    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed
reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29
for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.
    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robusta futures firmed at midday in
extremely quiet trading, ranging three to 12 stg per tonne
higher at the end of the morning call. Second position July
rose seven stg to 1,258 stg.
    As the recent increase in roaster demand seems to have
quieted today, dealers attributed the market's steadiness to a
technical consolidation of the decline in the past few weeks.
London futures appeared to be following New York coffee, which
has stabilized just above 1.00 dlr, some dealers said.
    Physicals were quiet, with significant origin offers and
roaster enquiry absent. Volume was 1,110 lots with 520 crosses.

<TITLE>BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>British corporate affairs minister Michael
Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
trade relations.
    In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
imbalance between the two countries.
    "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,"
Howard told reporters.
    "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
message got home," he added.
    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
said.
    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
Wireless from having a major role in the international
telephone market in Japan.
    "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
relations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continue
to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
long time."
    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
telecommunications issue.
    "There are measures which are under consideration if we
continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,"
he added, but gave no details.
    He said he had received a reassuring response from the
Japanese he has spoken with.
    "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
for quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is we
expect to see action."
    Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
equal access to overseas financial markets.

<TITLE>LONDON COCOA STANDS HARDLY CHANGED AT MIDDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures stood hardly changed from
last night at midday with near July last traded at yesterday's
offered level of 1,318 stg from a 1,324 high, dealers said.
    Overnight steadiness in New York was balanced by firm
sterling versus the dollar and continued availability of West
African new crop physical offers, notably Ghana and Ivory.
    The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325
French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was offering around
1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, dealers said.
    Volume midday was 1,013 lots including 130 crosses.
    Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in the
near future, the only other bullish feature on the immediate
horizon is the recently lower trade forecast for Bahia's
temporao crop which ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mln bags from
2.0 to 2.5 mln bags previously and compared with initial
expectations of three mln bags, dealers said.
    Some traders are now saying the temporao is more likely to
be near the lower end of the new range although this could be
offset by a higher than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop.
    Resale physicals were quiet although light enquiry was
seen, the dealers said.

<TITLE>VW CURRENCY DEPARTMENT FORMER HEAD ARRESTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUNSWICK, West Germany, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The former chief of
foreign exchange at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> has been arrested in
connection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker a
quarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor Carl
Hermann Retemeyer said.
    He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrested
yesterday for suspected embezzlement.
    "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evaded
justice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for his
arrest," Retemeyer said.
    VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of the
suspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gave
him leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.
    VW said last month computer programs were erased and
documents faked in the possible fraud, in which it believes
transactions meant to protect it against foreign currency
losses were not completed.
    Retemeyer said, "We are still investigating a larger circle
of people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"
    He would not comment whether other arrests could be
expected.
    The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-up
with the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board member
in charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility for
the affair.
    Retemeyer said last month he wanted to question
Frankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be able
to give more details.

<TITLE>CARDINAL INDUSTRIES &lt;CDNI> RESTATES NET LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VERNON, Conn., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cardinal Industries Inc said it
restated earnings for the first nine months of 1986 to 235,000
dlrs, or nine cts per share, from 485,000 dlrs, or 18 cts,
reported previously due to the failure of an automated
accounting system installed in mid-year and replaced in the
fourth quarter.
    The company said its Reliance segment sustained a
significant operating loss for the full year 1986 due to the
accounting problems and increased promotional and advertising
expenses.  For the full year, it said it earned 284,000 dlrs,
or 10 cts a share, up from 271,000 dlrs, or 10 cts, in 1985.
    Cardinal Industries said revenues for the year were 30.7
mln dlrs, up from 23.0 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The company said for the first quarter of 1987, earnings
were about 48,000 dlrs, up from 13,000 dlrs or nil per share in
the year ago period.  The year-ago first quarter earnings,
however, have been restated from 101,000 dlrs or four cts per
share.  It said sales for the first quarter were about
8,363,000 dlrs, up from 6,636,000 dlrs.
    For the first half of 1986, the company said it restated
earnings to 141,000 dlrs or five cts per share from 340,000
dlrs or 12 cts per share reported previously.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER TO HOLD TALKS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
holds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today, to
urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed
their economic growth.
    Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making
agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding.
    The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of
the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy
and Canada to form the Group of Seven.
    The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of
the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.
    The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson.
    Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to
reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic
growth, reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is
expected after the meeting ends.
    These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
    At the same time, monetary sources say they expect Baker to
put forward proposals, originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo
Summit, to tighten procedures for policy coordination.
    Washington wants other major nations to establish specific
policy goals for economic growth, inflation, current account
balance of payments, trade balances, budget performance,
monetary conditions and currencies.
    If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such
objectives, then countries should consult on whether corrective
action is necessary, the proposal says.
    Monetary sources said there was some support for the
proposal, which may not be made final until the Venice Economic
Summit in June, but Britain and West Germany were firmly
against any attempt to make corrective action automatic.
    The U.S. Treasury team, led by Baker, has worked on this
plan since last September, when it won the support of France.
    Baker, meanwhile, will press Japan and West Germany to live
up to their commitments, made over six weeks ago in Paris, to
boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports.
    He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the
Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a
significant budget deficit cut this year, helping to depress
U.S. demand for imports.
    The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge
imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the
one hand, and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other.
    Japan, in particular, is under pressure to come up with a
meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen.
    Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go
higher against the dollar, a development that has become
unacceptable in Japan.
    The Paris Agreement, by the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain and Canada, called for currencies to
be stabilized around current levels.
    But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the
agreement was reached, and its present stability is said to be
temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks.
    Meanwhile, representatives of the leading Third World
countries continue preparing their position for their ministers
to present to industrial nations later this week.
    Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing
nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the
western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure.
    They call instead for vast new assistance from the
industrial world and a much greater role for the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<TITLE>MICHIGAN GENERAL &lt;MGL> GETS OFFER COMMITMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Michigan General Corp said
holders of 75 pct of its outstanding 10-3/4 pct senior
subordinated debentures due December 1, 1998, have indicated
their intention to tender under the company's current exchange
offer and to reach an agreement with the company.
    It said it hopes to conclude negotiations with the
debenture holders and its lenders and to conclude the exchange
offer as soon as possible.
    Michigan General in March had said that the exchange offer
would be conditioned on 90 pct acceptance and on its lender
waiving or providing relief from loan agreement defaults.
    Michigan General had also said that the offer would be
conditioned on ratification of amendments to the indenture
governing the 10.75 pct debentures by holders of two thirds of
the issue.
    It had said that if the offer and talks with its lender did
not succeed, it would probably have to file for bankruptcy law
protection.
    Michigan General is offering to exchange 500 dlrs of
increasing rate senior subordinated notes due March 1, 1992,
200 dlrs of non-interest bearing delayed convertible senior
subordinated notes due March 1, 1997 and 2 shares of two dlr
delayed convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of
25 dlrs a share for each 1,000 dlrs of the debentures.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS OUTLOOK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Stock prices may climb higher today,
riding a two-day advance that saw the Dow Industrials climb 85
points, analysts said. But they cautioned that the market is
due for a pause after such a strong climb and could move into a
short term consolidation today as well.
    Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed above
the 2400 mark for the first time ever. Special situations,
airlines and a strong bond market helped push the average up 15
points to end the day at 2406. Gainers led losers by seven-six
on the Big Board, while volume slid slightly to 175 mln shares
from 213 mln shares last Friday.
    "I think we'll get a day that will be, on balance,
positive, but not any record setter," Thom Brown of Butcher and
Singer said.
    Brown said that the market needs a pause before any
stronger advance. "We need a bit of consolidation here," he
said. "Eighty-five points is just too much, too soon."
    Brown added that the market probably will not pay much
attention to the February consumer credit number being released
today. "The market's been ignoring fundamentals," he said.
    "I don't see any problems with the Blue Chips easing higher
today," Chris Callies of Dean Witter said. But she said the
market may have some short term trouble in this 2400 area.
"We're still in the midst of a correction" in the broad market,
she said. "It's not entirely clear that this rally is the end
of the two day correction that began last week."
    In the newspapers -- The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the
Street said some people feel that when Mesa Limited Partnership
provided badly needed assets to NRM Energy in exchange for a
large stake in the company the move may have turned NRM into a
T. Boone Pickens investment fund.
    The New York Times Market Place column said the first half
hour of trading is becoming more important. That is the time
when a large amount of important and growing investment from
Japan and Europe enters the market. Indeed, the column said
that a Salomon Brothers study shows that 44 pct of the market's
total gain during the first two and a half months of this year
came in the first half hour of trading.

ACCU-WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS - APRIL 7
    The storm that battered the eastern portion of the United
States over the weekend with heavy snow and flooding rains will
continue weakening today. Only lighter rains will linger from
Pennsylvania through New England.
    The drier weather will be welcome, as many streams and
rivers are near or over their banks, especially in New England.
    Significant rain has occurred the past two days in the
coffee growing regions of Kenya.
    Prior to Sunday, very dry weather had been occurring in the
central and eastern portions of the coffee areas. However, 0.50
to 2.00 inches and more rain occurred Sunday through Monday,
helping to erase the moisture deficits that had built up.
    The western coffee regions also shared in the ample rains
of the past couple of days, but moisture supplies were already
adequate.
    Moisture supplies in most of the major wheat growing
regions of the United States are currently adequate, despite
dry weather the past week. However, there are a couple of
pockets where rain would be welcome.
    The wheat regions of Washington State have been rather dry
since the beginning of the year, as less than 65 pct of normal
precipitation has been recorded. Also, the past few weeks have
been extremely dry.
    The wheat areas of Minnesota and eastern North Dakota could
also use rain the next few weeks, before spring planting begins.

<TITLE>LME COPPER MIDSESSION FEATURES CASH PRICING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>LME morning ring dealings in copper ended
with three months Grade A business at 883 stg per tonne, up
seven stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to
1,417 dlrs per tonne, a rise of 11 dlrs.
    Morning ring dealings featured a wave of cash pricing
purchases near the official close which established an
indicated spread backwardation of 37 stg after earlier
borrowing at a premium of 32 stg, unchanged from yesterday
afternoon, traders said.
    Forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency
factors, with short covering and some chart support evident.
    Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing
interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation
of 23 stg.
    Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a
minor chart support base, although upside potential remains
limited against a background of routine physical demand and a
buoyant U.K. Currency.
    On the pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based and
within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders said.
    Standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg
but was tradeless.

<TITLE>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT EXPECTED TO FALL TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's government is expected to fall
tomorrow after the majority Christian Democrats decided to
withdraw their 16 ministers unless Socialist Prime Minister
Bettino Craxi resigned, political sources said today.
    They said the decision brought the prospect of early
general elections even closer.
    After a tense eight-hour meeting, the Christian Democrat
leadership late last night said it registered "the dissolution
of the present government," in which the party provides more
than half the 30 ministers.
    Party leader Ciriaco De Mita told reporters that when Craxi
went to parliament for a confidence debate. "There won't be a
Craxi government any more ... I don't believe you can have a
confidence vote for a government which does not exist."
    Craxi announced today after being told of the Christian
Democrat decision that a cabinet meeting would be held tomorrow
afternoon and he would then go to the Senate (upper house).
    The sources said that at the cabinet meeting the Christian
Democrats, senior partners in a coalition including Social
Democrats, Liberals and Republicans as well as the Socialists,
would tell Craxi he had to resign.
    If he refused to do so and insisted on a full debate they
would withdraw their ministers, forcing the collapse of the
government before a confidence vote, the sources said.

<TITLE>LME LEAD MIDSESSION FIRMER ON CASH METAL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade house pricing purchases of cash
metal at the end of the official ring gave the LME lead market
a firmer tone this morning, dealers said.
    The cash metal price rose from 805.50 up to 807 stg before
the pricing demand was satisfied. The backwardation widened to
around six stg a tonne from three stg yesterday.
    Some buying interest was stimulated for three months
delivery up to 301 stg and the 483 dlrs equivalent but dealers
generally reckoned this was "range trading' and expected
resistance to develop around 305 stg or 485 dlrs.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>LME zinc was quiet throughout the morning
with very little dealing after some light trade selling on the
pre-market, dealers said.
    Three months delivery ended official ring dealings quoted
at 454.50/455 stg a tonne, down around two stg from yesterday
afternoon's kerb close.
    The pre-market dollar based trade selling pushed three
months down to a 730 dlrs equivalent but attracted no follow
through selling and the price held at that level for the rest
of the morning.

began on February 27 and has been tapering off for weeks, has
now ended, a seamen's spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the seamen had signed an agreement with
the state-owned Lloyd Brasileiro company on Saturday for a 120
pct salary rise.
    The national strike had been tailing off since mid-March as
seamen struck individual accords with companies. At the height
of the stoppage, seamen said about 200 ships were strike-bound.

<DATELINE>    Milan, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ing. C. Olivetti EC Spa &lt;OLIV.MI> plans to
announce a new line of computer products in June, company
chairman Carlo De Benedetti said at a news conference.
    De Benedetti said the new products would include personal
computers and would compete with the new computers announced
last week by International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>.
    De Benedetti reiterated that Olivetti's provisional figures
show that 1986 turnover rose 1160 billion lire to 7,300 billion
lire and that net profit will be more than 550 billion lire
compared with 503.7 billion the year before.
    "This year will be a year of consolidation of the results
reached thus far and characterized by an important renewal of
the product line and the turnaround of Triumph Adler," he said.
    Olivetti acquired West German typewriter maker &lt;Triumph
Adler> from Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> last year . As part of the
deal, VW bought a five pct stake in Olivetti. De Benedetti
added that Olivetti would continue to seek international
alliances.

months business at 2,365 stg per tonne, up about seven stg from
yesterday's afternoon kerb close, equivalent to 1.7225 dlrs per
lb, a rise of 0.5 cents.
    The market traded up to 2,370 stg near the official morning
ring close under the influence of trade buying before
speculative selling halted the advance, traders said.
    Borrowing interest over the last two delivery months was
seen at a narrower contango of five stg.
    The market now appears to be showing signs of mild
dollar-based bullishness, analysts said.

    It also looks for 1987 full-year fully diluted earnings to

    Chairman Donald Clark, in remarks prepared for delivery to

share repurchase program, will result in higher earnings per

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>LME aluminium prices eased this morning
under light dollar based selling of three months delivery but
persistent covering of nearby short positions widened the
backwardation to around 69 stg from 66 yesterday, dealers said.
    Three months ended official ring dealings at 805.50 stg,
down 2.50 stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close,
and the dollar equivalent traded from 1,299 on the pre-market
down to 1,293 dlrs at the end of the rings and compared with
1,298 yesterday.
    The nearby covering was prompted by supply tightness
created by likely large April option declarations but no
reports circulated this morning of any further enquiry for
short term April options. This was evident Friday and
yesterday.

    Bids amounted to 19,115 tonnes against offerings of 31,528.
Prices paid were at, or above, the prevailing intervention feed
wheat price of 120.71 stg per tonne.
    Grain traders said a large part of the tonnage on offer was
in stores, which would mean high transport costs to deficient
areas. The European Commission recently made available 70,000
tonnes for next week's tender.

<TITLE>DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN NEW YORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened lower following the
trend set earlier in the Far East and Europe, dealers said.
    Still, the U.S. currency remained well within recent
trading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out on
a limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five finance
ministers and central bankers in Washington.
    The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism that
this week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measures
to stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions, U.S.
dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively.
    The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen, down from 145.85/90.
    The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japan
intervention on its behalf in Tokyo, dealers noted. Dealers in
Japan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yen
during Tokyo hours.
    "There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo, but apparently
it wasn't too hectic," said a dealer at one major U.S. bank.
"The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washington
meetings."
    The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks, down from
1.8260/70 at last night's close, and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5180/90.
    Meanwhile, sterling prolonged its advance with the aid of
more public opinion polls indicating the ruling Conservative
party would retain power with a large majority in any general
election. Sterling rose to 1.6186/91 dlrs, from 1.6175/85 on
Monday, but eased slightly to about 2.953 marks from 2.955.
    Dealers did not detect any U.K. intervention to subdue the
pound today. Some said the U.K. central bank may have bought
dollars for yen in Europe, but this could not be confirmed.
    The dollar eased to 1.3071/76 Canadian dollars from
1.3080/85 yesterday, showing limited response to president
Reagan's endorsement of efforts for U.S./Canada free trade.

<TITLE>DATA GENERAL &lt;DGN> TO TAKE 2ND QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WESTBORO, Mass., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Data General Corp said it
expects to record an extraordinary pretax charge of about 18.2
mln dlrs in the second quarter ended March 28.
    The company said the charge will result from a redemption
of debt. On May 18, Data General said, it will redeem 150 mln
dlrs of outstanding 12-3/8 pct sinking fund debentures due
2015.
    The redemption price will be 111.138 pct of the total
principal amount of notes then outstanding plus accrued
interest to the redemption date, it said.
    No interest will accrue or will be payable on the
debentures starting May 18, the computer and communications
company said.
    Data General reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs or six cts a
share for the second quarter ended March 29, 1986. The loss
included a charge of 3.8 mln dlrs from redemption of
debentures. In the year-ago quarter, revenues fell less than
one pct to 318.8 mln dlrs.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil
production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower
yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    The publication expects total Malaysian output during
Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For
East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000
tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75
mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.
    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both
countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until
1988-90.
    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees
reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male
inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.
    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected
this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could
especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,
while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and
July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.
    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's
yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three
years, Oil World said without elaborating.
    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year
were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in
January 1986, Oil World said.
    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop
500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East
Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.
    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about
eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall
Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct
to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,
are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.
    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are
both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the
country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during
Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of
the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival
throughout May, it said.
    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to
350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent
Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the
country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill
Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

money market with a further 284 mln stg assistance in the
afternoon session.
    This takes the bank's total help so far today to 508 mln
stg and compares with its revised estimate of a 900 mln stg
shortage in the system which it earlier revised up from 850
mln.
    The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills
comprising 100 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 56 mln stg in
band two at 9-13/16 pct, 112 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct
and 16 mln stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY FUTURES CALLED SLIGHTLY HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Traders expect U.S. energy futures will
open higher, tracking firmer gasoil futures and cash crude
markets. Also lending support, said traders, are reports that
the Iran/Iraq war is heating up.
    Crude futures are called five to 10 cts higher with support
from a squeeze in the April 15-day forward Brent crude market,
which traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today, and from
domestic grades, trading unchanged to seven cts higher, traders
said.
    Iraq said today it attacked Iran's Sirri Island as well as
offshore oil escalations west of Kharg Island.
     Iran meanwhile reported victories on the southern front in
its war with Iraq.
    These reports may support the market, which is "begging for
news," said one broker. He said resistance is at 18.75-18.85
dlrs, then 19.00 dlrs a barrel for May crude.
    Products are called 0.25-0.50 cent higher a gallon
following gasoil futures which ended the morning session 1.25
dlrs higher a tonne basis April, which expired today, and 1.00
dlr higher basis May, traders said.

<TITLE>SPAIN'S SOCIALISTS HOLD OUT AGAINST STRIKERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jules Stewart, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Widespread strikes have not seriously
disrupted Spain's economy and wage restrictions are likely to
continue as policy makers call for more austerity to help the
country compete in the European Community (EC), foreign bankers
and analysts said.
    "The strikes were unexpected and in some cases spectacular,
but they have had little effect on basic economic life," a U.S.
Banker told Reuters. "The socialists can apply restrictive
measures as long as the unions remain relatively weak."
    The communist-led Workers' Commissions recently rejected a
call by its leadership for a general strike while the ruling
Socialist Party's trade union arm, the General Workers' Union,
has refused to demonstrate with the communists on May 1.
    The government's chief concern is inflation, which stood at
8.3 pct last year. The high inflation rate is especially
damaging in view of Spain's trade balance with Europe, which
turned into a deficit last year after entry to the EC.
    Officials say the situation is rapidly deteriorating. The
deficit of 450 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 was
only slightly below the 515 mln dlr deficit for all of 1986.
    The government has tightened up money supply, called for
maximum 5.0 pct wage increases -- the same as this year's
inflation target -- and is pursuing a program of industrial
restructuring despite an unemployment rate of 21.5 pct.
    Bankers say tight-money policies have attracted an
avalanche of foreign capital that is cashing in on the strong
peseta and high interest rates and those funds, converted into
pesetas, are swelling money supply still further.
    Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said last week that
money supply is expected to rise 14.3 pct in the first quarter
compared with this year's eight pct target.
    Most analysts agree that the government will have to accept
inflation closer to six pct this year but they say there is
little cause for alarm.
    "The money supply should be back on track by the summer and
we will begin to see lower interest rates," said Andres
Trujillo, general manager of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corp's Madrid branch.
    He told Reuters the labour protests, despite occasional
outbursts of violence, are not having a serious impact on
foreign investment.
    "Spain is a big and relatively underdeveloped market," he
said. "It is still easier to compete from here than in other
countries and this sporadic unrest is not likely to scare off
investors."
    Juan Jose Macaya, general manager of Investban SA, a
portfolio management company, said he expects monetary
objectives to be under control in two or three months.
    "There has been some nervousness in the stock exchange but
we see this as a short-term reaction," he said.

<TITLE>SYNGOLD DEFINES RESERVES ON DEKA PROPERTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Syngold Exploration Inc> and &lt;Corp
Falconbridge Copper> said they defined undiluted reserves of
911,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.43 ounces of
gold per ton in two separate deposits on the Deka property
located at Noranda, Quebec.
    Assay results from 20 suface holes drilled on 250 foot
centers indicate that the Donalda number one deposit contains
possible reserves of 611,000 tons at an average grade of 0.48
ounces of gold per ton.
    The number one deposit's reserves are contained between a
vertical depth of 750 and 1200 feet at a strike length of 900
feet.
    Reserves of the Donalda number-two deposit, located 1,000
feet below the number-one deposit, were recalculated at 300,000
tons with an average grade of 0.33 ounces of gold per ton.
    Syngold has earned a 20 pct interest in the Deka property
from the operator, Corp Falconbridge Copper.

<TITLE>U.S. GOLD FUTURES OPEN FIRMER ON WEAK DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex gold futures opened firmer on the
back of a weak dollar and firm silver values.
    The pacesetting June delivery was up 90 cts at 423.50 dlrs
an ounce, recouping some of yesterday's light losses of 1.50
dlrs. Other contracts gained 1.70 to 2.30 dlrs.
    Floor analysts said the precious metal mirrored the action
in the silver trading ring more than anything else. Speculators
continued to buy silver on hopes it would soon hit seven dlrs
an ounce in the May contract.
    The stock market again acted as a drag on gold even though
it slipped on profit-taking this morning, analysts said.

<TITLE>CAMBRIDGE BIOSCIENCE &lt;CBCX> TO START AIDS TESTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WORCESTER, Mass., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cambridge BioScience Corp said
it received Federal Drug Administration approval on its
"Investigational New Drug" filing to begin human clinical
trials of its second generation diagnostic test for AIDS.
    The company said it anticipates the test may be released to
worldwide markets by late 1987 or early 1988.
    Cambridge BioScience also said it expects to file soon an
"Investigational New Drug"  with the FDA on its screening test
for detecting AIDS antibodies.
    This test, which is being evaluated in emergency situations
in several African nations, does not require highly trained
technicians nor instrumentation, according to the company.

    Cambridge BioScience explained that the filing for human
clinical trials for AIDS that received FDA approval, utilizes
recombinant-DNA technology to detect and screen antibodies in
blood or serum of patients infected with the AIDS-causing
virus.
    The other separate planned filing with the FDA is a
revolutionary, five-minute latex agglutination screening test
for detecting AIDS antibodies, the company said. This test,
utilizes latex beads coated with CBC's recombinant antigen
which attract and hold AIDS antibodies, forming clusters
(agglutination), which indicates a positive result.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKETS OPEN LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. credit markets opened lower,
undercut by a weaker dollar, dealers said.
    The impetus for the opening declines came from overseas
trading, where a lack of retail buying led to profit-taking
that erased yesterday's moderate gains, dealers said.
    Most investors have stepped to the sidelines to await the
outcome of this week's monetary meetings in Washington and to
see how it affects exchange rates, they added.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond opened 17/32 lower at
95-22/32 to yield 7.88 pct compared with 7.84 pct at
yesterday's close. It fell to 95-26/32 in late Tokyo trade.
    "How the bond market trades seems to be a mirror image of
how the dollar/yen trades," a dealer said. "As the dollar goes,
so goes the market, but so far we're just bouncing around in
thin trading."
    Skepticism that this week's monetary meetings of leading
industrial nations in Washington will produce substantive
agreements to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan
and take pressure off the dollar is weighing on bond prices.
    "I can't imagine that anything of much substance could
comoe out of these meetings other than a reiteration of
previous statements," a dealer said.
    Dealers said U.S. government securities prices will be
vulnerable as long as further dollar declines are expected.
    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/16 to 99-20/32 at the
opening and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 11/32 to 97-25/32.
    Treasury bill rates rose in early trading, pulled higher in
sympathy with the rise in coupon yields.
    Three-month bills were unchanged from yesterday's auction
price at 5.53 pct bid, while six-month bills rose six basis
points from their auction price to 5.69 pct bid.
    Year bills rose four basis points to 5.77 pct bid.
    The Federal funds rate opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained at
this level in early trading. It averaged 6.20 pct yesterday.
    Economists said seasonal pressures on bank reserves point
to a possible indirect injection of temporary reserves by the
Federal Reserve this morning. Some look for the Fed to purchase
coupon securities this afternoon.
    Dealers said the market may take its next cue from Federal
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's Congressional testimony at 1000
EDT (1400 GMT) this morning.

<TITLE>AIRBUS TO USE GE &lt;GE> ENGINE ON A-340 AIRLINER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortium
is to change the lead engine on its A-340 aircraft because the
high-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, a
company spokesman said.
   Airbus has chosen the Franco-U.S. CFM-56-S3 engines to
replace the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) consortium's
superfan. The spokesman added the new engine, to be produced by
General Electric Co of the U.S. And SNECMA of France, can
provide greater thrust than the IAE rival.
    The spokesman said the IAE consortium, which includes Pratt
and Whitney of the U.S. And Britain's &lt;Rolls Royce>, is unable
to supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when the
A-340 is due to become operational.
    Airbus signed an agreement with IAE last December,
replacing an earlier accord with GE and &lt;SNECMA>, whose CFM-56
engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust,
compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs.
    The latest version of the CFM-56, however, can provide a
30,600 lbs thrust.
    The Airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did not
exclude the IAE superfan, once ready, being offered as an
alternative engine on the A-340 as the superfan was more
fuel-efficient than the CFM engine.
    The spokesman said Airbus expected IAE to come back with
some proposals on superfan's new production timetable within
the next few weeks or months.

<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE FUTURES SEEN STEADY TO HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures were expected to
continue their upward climb to new season's highs and highest
levels in years as fundamentals continue to point upward,
traders said.
    They cited steady to higher live calls as the main buying
factor. Market-ready supplies remain tight and packer interest
has been improving, they noted.
    A firm tone to cash wholesale beef and moderate boxed beef
movement at higher cutout prices were also cited as supporting
factors. Stopping of deliveries by strong hands will likely add
to strength in spot April, they added.

<TITLE>N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES RISE IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Platinum futures rose in thin early
trading as the metal again followed silver to higher ground,
floor analysts said.
    The key July delivery traded at 573.50 dlrs an ounce, up
4.90 dlrs. Other months posted gains of 4.40 to 7.40 dlrs.
Palladium was 20 to 70 cts firmer in sympathy.
    Silver continued to set the pace for the metals complex,
attracting purchases by professional traders and investors amid
speculation the metal would soon breach selling resistance at
seven dlrs an ounce in the May delivery.
    However, quick day-trader profit taking in the silver ring
spilled over and platinum also backed off from early highs,
brokers said.

steady to mostly higher after yesterday's mostly higher close.
    Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by firmer live
calls and the continued discount of futures to cash. Hog runs
are light as farmers are starting spring fieldwork in some
areas, they noted.
    Private reports of steady to firm cash pork products and a
rise in the cutout yesterday was adding to packer interest for
cash hogs, they said.
    Spillover strength from higher cattle pits is also likely
again today, they added.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pork belly futures were expected to open
steady to higher after yesterday's late strength and sharply
higher close in the nearby.
    Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by steady to
mostly higher live hog calls and light hog runs. Slaughter is
likely to remain on the light side and lend support to cash
product, they said.
    Private reports of hedger interest for cash product also
prompted calls of steady to higher for cash bellies this
morning, they added.

<TITLE>HUTTON &lt;EFH> ENDS PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WILTON, Conn., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emery Air Freight Corp said it has
entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under
which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator
Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer,
effective April 13.
    Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to
unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender
offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for
Purolator stock.
    Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended
its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for
two more days.  It said it only about 450,000 shares, or 6.5
pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn,
down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.
    Emery's bid expires April 28.
    Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery
said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter
into merger negotiations with it.
    Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares
or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute
PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to
pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator
due to the acquisition of control by another party.
    The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay
all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with
the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed
to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA ARRANGING TWO CO-FINANCINGS FOR PROJECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia is in the process of arranging
two co-financings for projects in the electrical sector,
director of public credit Mauricio Cabrera said.
    He told journalists he expects an 86.6 mln dlr loan to be
co-financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to be
completed by the middle of next month.
    He also said talks have just concluded with the World Bank
on a 200 mln dlr co-financing and that discussions with the
bankers will begin later this month.
    Cabrera was here for the signing yesterday of a 50 mln dlr
floating rate note.
    The floating rate note was the first such issue for
Colombia, which has had limited access to the international
capital markets since the eruption of the international debt
crisis in 1982, despite its ability to avoid a rescheduling.
    The IADB co-financing is for Interconexion Electrica SA
(ISA), a public electricity utility. The loan is for 10 years,
with four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the
grace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct,
Cabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct.
    The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISA
will contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added.
    Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging
the commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera noted
that only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year.
    He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to
the market no earlier than June. It is part of an overall
financing for various projects in the electrical sector that
will take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year.
    Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADB
to contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bank
of Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will come
from commercial banks.
    Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in
the international capital markets this year.
    The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in
floating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappeared
in the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the
number of market makers contracted sharply.
    Cabrera said he is now considering several options,
including a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan. Last
year Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for the
equivalent of about 40 mln dlrs. Although it prefers a public
issue, Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately.
    Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday,
which was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8
pct over Libor, was basically a "disguised loan."
    Cabrera said that as of December 31, 1986, Colombia had 11
billion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 3.4 billion dlrs
of private sector debt.
    Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billion
dlrs, he said that about 1.4 billion had been arranged before
the end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will be
drawn in future years.

<TITLE>MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - MODEST MOVEMENT, BIDS FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Country movement of corn and soybeans
increased modestly this morning, and basis bids were steady to
higher, cash grain dealers said.
    Basis bids firmed in response to lower rates for barge
freight, traders said, noting that the Ohio River is swelling
with snow runoff, discouraging barge loadings because of the
high water levels.
    Moderate bookings continued in new crop soybeans, mostly
for January 1988 delivery, with farmers pricing at least a
portion of their crop at five dlrs a bushel or better when bids
emerge at that level, they said.
    Movement in Iowa was expected to slow considerably in the
next few days, as farmers are beginning field work, they said.
    Dealers bid 104 and offered 106 pct for PIK certificates.

<TITLE>COMEX SILVER FUTURES SOAR AT OPENING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex silver futures opened 15 to 18
cents higher and then retreated slightly as followthrough
buying slowed.
    May was up 12.5 cents at 6.705 dlrs from a high of 6.75
dlrs. July was up 13.1 cents at 6.785 dlrs from 6.84 dlrs.
    Traders said large commission houses were buyers on the
open but encountered profit-taking and a slowdown in orders.
    Some traders said the market is starting to look overbought
technically and vulnerable to a correction.
    But they added that speculators continue to view the market
as a good buy relative to gold.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS LOWER IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Weakness in the dollar and a subsequent
easing of bond prices underscored Wall Street's lingering
anxiety with interest rates and inflation, and prompted
investors to take some profits. The decline, though mild, was
broad based.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which recorded its 33rd
record high of the year yesterday, when it passed the 2400
level for the first time, fell 10 points to 2396 this morning.
Declines led advances three to two on volume of 19 mln shares.
Bellsouth led the actives with a loss of 1/4 to 39-1/4. IBM
fell 1/4 to 149-1/8.

<TITLE>U.S. DEBT FUTURES LOWER IN QUIET OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. interest rate futures were lower in
quiet early activity.
    A weak dollar pressured debt futures. Remarks made
yesterday by Council of Economic Advisers Beryl Sprinkel that
the U.S. has no target value for the dollar continued to impact
the market, traders said.
    The market awaited action by finance ministers of the G-5
nations, who are to meet today. Pending any action that would
strengthen the dollar, June Treasury bonds were expected to
remain below chart resistance at 98-16/32, traders said.
    Chart support was cited at 97-23/32 on a day-trading basis
and at 97-3/32 on a longer-term basis.
    At 0950 EDT, CBT T-bonds ranged from down 16/32 to 11/32
point, T-notes fell 10/32 to 11/32 and muni bonds were down
9/32 point. IMM T-bills were 3 to 5 basis points lower and
Eurodollars fell 4 to 7 basis points.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY FUTURES POST GAINS AFTER FIRM OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Light mixed buying around the rings
boosted U.S. energy futures to new daily highs after a slightly
firmer open, traders said.
    May crude jumped 15 cts to 18.82 dlrs a barrel, nearing the
top end of a 17.75-18.85 dlrs resistance range. Traders said
firmness in the North Sea Brent cash crude market plus reports
of escalation in the Iran/Iraq war lent support to crude
futures. April 15-day forward Brent crude traded as high as
19.40 dlrs a barrel today.
    Traders said resistance continues overhead near 19.00 dlrs
a barrel for May crude futures.
     Gasoline continued to post larger gains than heating oil
and to trade at a premium to two oil futures. May gasoline was
up 0.56 cent to 53.50 cts a gallon, at resistance.
    May heating oil was up 0.36 cent to 49.15 cts a gallon. 
Both contracts were off 0.05 cent from this morning's high.

<TITLE>CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO EASIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soybean futures were expected to
open steady, possibly easier on a disappointing weekly soybean
export figure below the previous week and year ago levels and
moderate country movement overnight, traders said.
    The outlook for increased Brazilian harvest pressure later
this month and the settlement of the Brazilian seamen strike
will add to the negative sentiment in old crop.
 ----
 Brazil's soybean harvest was 24 pct complete by April 3,
compared with an average of 36 pct, the Safras and Mercado
newsletter said, with Rio Grande do Sul 10 pct and 17 pct
respectively, Parana 55 and 63 pct respectively, Mato Grosso do
Sul 30 and 36 pct, Mato Grosso 10 pct and NA, Goias 10 pct and
NA and other states 25/30 and 36 pct respectively.

<TITLE>CBT WHEAT FUTURES EXPECTED TO OPEN STEADY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT wheat futures were expected to open
steady, supported by followthrough speculative buying after
yesterday's strong close when new contract highs were set in
new crop, traders said.
    However, rumors that several countries have passed on their
tenders for U.S. wheat or taken wheat from other exporting
countries may keep nearbys on the defensive.
 ----
 The USDA will issue this week a swap catalogue of
government-owned grain that storage-surplus elevators will be
able to swap with storage-deficit locations, a senior USDA
official said...Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered
considerable damage due to frost during a spell of unusually
cold weather in late March, the China daily said.

steady to slightly easier in sympathy with expected weakness in

they added.

lower trend to financial futures early touched off some stop
loss orders. Futures fell to near technical support before
recovering slightly, traders said.
    Some pressure also stemmed from a quiet cash market and
erroding cash prices, they said.
    Commission houses and locals sold on the break and offset
scale-down buying by GNP, they added.

<TITLE>RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shifts in domestic economic policy,
not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the
key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance
Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.
    Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that
protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate
the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.
    "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous
U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the
dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."
    "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic
economic and financial policies," Ruding said.
    Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the
weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord
to stabilize foreign exchange rates.
    He said the highest priority should be given to policy
changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget
deficit and encouraging domestic savings.
    But he said other countries, such as Japan and West
Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing
their trade surpluses.

<TITLE>VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar
could be counterproductive for world economic growth.
    Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker
said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth
in those countries was also decreasing.
    "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation
of the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said.
    Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not
been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker
said.
    On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say
whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in
trade.
    "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate
adjustment has already been made," he said.
    "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a
growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United
States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing
in the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said.
    Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially
while import growth should slow.
    Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a
minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have
to slow its spending growth.
    It would also have to achieve a better balance between
investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to
dispense with foreign capital.
    "The constructive way to work in the needed direction would
be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way
for improvements in our trade accounts," he said.
    Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk
renewed inflation, he said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose
sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,
traders and analysts said.
    The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,
ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.
    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his
previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company
earned 70 cts a share.
    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause
even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."
    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,
the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
innovative company in the business," he said.
    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
have a growth rate of 55 pct.

<TITLE>U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States has appealed for
stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
services will take four years to negotiate.
    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
world trading system and the global economy," Smith said.
    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."
    He also also urged that member states be accountable to
each other for their trade policies.
    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
    "We are interested in more periodic ministerial
involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.
    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
panel be set up to review the agreement.
    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
to U.S. Exports.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS LOWER IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street stocks rebounded from their
early lows as the dollar firmed. Shares of automakers scored a
second straight session of strong gains, and expectations of
rising oil prices today sent many energy issues higher, traders
said.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell more than 10
points in the first minutes of trading this morning when the
dollar weakened and bond prices eased, recovered to post an 11
point gain to 2416. Advances led declines by only a slight
margin on volume of 48 mln shares. GM gained two to 83-1/2 and
Ford 5/8 to 90-3/4. Chrysler rose 3/8 to 58-5/8.

<TITLE>VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in
laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to
world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new
financing.
    "There is clearly a danger that adequate financing
arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a
timely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.
    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with
confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,
he said.
    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world
economic power, but it is in a difficult position today,
Volcker said.
    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize
Brazil's external payments.
    "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian
authorities," he said.
    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to
work together, Volcker said.
    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was
critically important that markets be kept open by the
industrial nations.
    In addition, the United States must reduce its budget
deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their
domestic economies, Volcker said.
    "We need time for those actions and the earlier
depreciation to work their effects," he said.

<TITLE>UNISYS &lt;UIS> OFFERS NEW MAINFRAME MODELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unisys Corp said it is offering eight
new models of its A15 large-scale mainframe computer.
    The new models improve the overall system performance by an
average 20 pct, the computer maker said.
    Memory capacity on four of the models is doubled, and is
increased by 50 pct on the A12 mainframe.
    Unisys said prices for the new models range from 2.9 mln
dlrs for the single processor A-15FX to 8.4 mln dlrs for an
A-15NX, which has four processors.
    The new computer systems, which encorporate the "Master
Control Program/Advanced Systems" operating system, will
compete with other large mainframes, including International
Business Machines Corp's &lt;IBM> IBM 3090, Unisys said.
    Unisys' A-12 computer is a less powerful, smaller version
of the A-15.
    The A-12 is a "lower-end model, almost an entry-level
machine," said a Unisys spokesman.
    The price of the machine starts at 1.4 mln dlrs.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank council member Lothar
Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
pushing up interest rates.
    Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
    The article followed international press speculation that
the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
of an exchange rate policy.
    Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position
as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,
noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading
interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led
some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.
    "Simply to ignore the external economic context would be
risky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained.
    Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an
end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now
assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency
inflows slow down.
    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and
long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged
investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller
said.
    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary
growth back onto the desired path, he said.
    "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this
quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the
changed economic situation of the last few months," he added.
    "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money
supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite
suppositions to the contrary," Mueller said.
    "Keeping money supply developments in check is not always
synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when
excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than
growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary
holdings of non-banks," Mueller said.
    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits
other concepts were needed for monetary policy.
    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for
monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.
    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.
Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.
    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of
a strict stability policy because both interest rates and
liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention
and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.
    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the
Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other
market conditions, Mueller said.
    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central
bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.
    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity
of industry and households which cannot be directly reached
with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.
    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the
harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been
the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable
sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.
    "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise
with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if
credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed
its target but probably even set off further inflows," he said.
    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.
    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate
of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.
    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to
six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock
growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.
    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there
should be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must be
first and foremost stability policy and successful stability
policy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said.

the stability of exchange rates a major priority.
    In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker

exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.
    "I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward
greater exchange rate stability," Volcker said. "I think that the
objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom
larger among our various policy priorities."

in quiet trading that was devoid of fundamental or technical
features, traders said.
    Locals tracked the London cocoa market while many
speculators chose to stay sidelined, waiting for the buffer
stock manager to enter as a buyer, traders said.
    Origins and manufacturers were inactive, traders added.
    Cocoa for May delivery was off nine dlrs at 1,925 dlrs a
tonne in a 1,928 to 1,922 dlr range.
    July was off 10 dlrs at 1,957 dlrs.

<TITLE>ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
    It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its
G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
session of talks involving G-5 members.
    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-
    "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to
be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the
enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "the
management or the improvement of the international monetary
economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"
    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber
stamping agreements already taken.
    The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was "certain that
this time incidents would not occur."
    But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the
role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait has asked at least four
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
"Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.
    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
mouth of the gulf.
    "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked
not to be identified, told Reuters.
    The United States is considering the request to temporarily
transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
said.
    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

<TITLE>ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Iain Pears, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce
Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus
Industrie> A340 aircraft.
    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the
details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
which shares will be offered.
    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
for 1987.
    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
    Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
    The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
    When the government announced the sale, it said it would
inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt
and Whitney unit.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker
said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be
counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before
the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and
Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries
was also decreasing. (NRFD 1428)
    NEW YORK - The dollar held onto its gains which were made
with the help of remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Vocker.  His
comment that a further, sizeable decline could be
counter-productive helped the U.S. Currency recover to the
unchanged level of 1.8265/73 marks. (NYFC 1433)
    WASHINGTON - U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker holds
talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan to urge them to
carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed their
economic growth. (NREC 1302)
    WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker
said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the
groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to world debt
difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing. (NRFM
1439)
    LONDON - Gold bullion eased to an afternoon fix of 418.50
dlrs, 258.653 stg, an ounce in sympathy with lower values on
Comex, dealers said. The market remained fairly quiet, however,
and was still being overshadowed by silver. (GDLS 1457)
    WASHINGTON - Shifts in domestic economic policy, not a
further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key
to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance
Minister H.Onno Ruding said. (NRFA 1417)

<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE FUTURES SET NEW HIGHS, THEN SLIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures ran up for gains of
0.40 to 0.07 cent and again posted new season's highs in all
months before slipping to trade 0.10 cent higher to 0.12 lower
in latest dealings.
    Futures ran up to new highs at the start on general
carryover demand prompted by strong fundamentals. Higher live
calls, tight market ready supplies and private reports of
strength in cash beef stimulated demand. Strong stoppers of
deliveries added to strength in April, traders said.
    Professional and commission house profit-taking weighed on
prices in latest trade, they said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said the performance of the dollar in exchange markets
could be a factor in the U.S. central bank's decisions on
monetary policy.
    "The performance of the dollar in the exchange market might
become a factor bearing on our provision of reserves," Volcker
said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.
    He said that fiscal policy changes in the United States,
Germany and Japan would be more important that intervention to
instill confidence in current exchange rate levels.

<TITLE>CBT CORN FUTURES TRADE QUIETLY MIXED EARLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT corn futures traded firmer early,
holding gains of 1-1/4 cents to 3/4 cent per bushel in
moderately light early trade.
    Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to
about three times last year's weekly inspections, plus the
outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline
in the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.
    Cargill, the Illinois Co-op, Refco and ADM were the
featured buyers of old crop May, with CIS a buyer in new crop
December, pit brokers said.

<TITLE>EQUITIES DRIFT LOWER ON EASIER WALL STREET OPENING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Equities drifted lower after the easier
opening on Wall Street, but the London market was depressed
from the outset on lack of interest and a feeling that
yesterday's gains were overdone, dealers said.
    Much of today's business was inter-professional, but
dealers noted that despite today's falls and low volume the
market still had a firm, although cautious, undertone. At 1430
GMT the FTSE 100 index was down 8.1 points at 1,981.5 compared
with an opening 1,987.4.
    Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan,
although less pronounced, provided further caution.
    Yesterday, the Japanese finance ministry made moves to try
and dispel fears of a trade war by saying it will help to
expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate
foreign membership.
    However, British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard
has told Japan to resolve the row over Cable and Wireless'
shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or
face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations.
    Cable and Wireless, which has been at the centre of the
trade row, was up 2p at 372.
    The latest media opinion polls helped to underpin prices as
they strengthened the belief that the ruling Tory party will
win the next U.K. General election. Although there is still
uncertainty over the timing of the election, most dealers
polled by Reuters this afternoon thought that June would be the
most likely time.
    A poll conducted for the breakfast television programme
TV-AM showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead of the
Opposition Labour Party, while a poll in the Times newspaper,
which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the
Tories a lead of six points over the labour opposition.
    Market leader ICI stood unchanged at 1,335 but IC Gas
slipped 14p to 752 on profit-taking after yesterday's stong
gain while Jaguar rose 15p to 590 mainly on U.S demand ahead of
a motor show in New York.
    Pharmaceuticals had Wellcome down 23p to 397 on further
profit-taking in the wake of adverse press comment on the side
effects of its "Retrovir" aids drug. London International Group
gained 13p to 301 as operators switched out of Wellcome.
    Extel lost a net 26p to 464 in the wake of yesterday's news
that Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp
would not be making a bid for the company.
    In a generally easier oil sector, BP fell 18p to 912 after
yesterday's statement by Standard Oil that it considered BP's
70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of the company it
does not already own as "inadequate."
    In banks, Standard Chartered lost 4p to 820 after its
recent gains on the back of bid rumours, but dealers noted
press speculation that Australian businessman Robert Holmes
A'Court had increased his stake in the company yesterday.
    Many operators expect Lloyds bank to renew its offer for
Standard once its one year bid limit ends in July, although
some dealers thought this unlikely. Lloyds gained 1p to 488.
    Elsewhere, industrial group Norcros gained 9p to 448 on
speculation of a bid for the company, while food retailer Tesco
added 2p to 475 after extending its 151 mln stg contested bid
for Hillards Plc until May 1. Hillards was a penny up at 314.
    Government bonds stood generally lower in late trading with
prices drifting down on a lack of interest. Gilts gained around
5/16 point at the outset on the back of the opinion polls.
    Equities tended to move up in later quiet trading as Wall
Street rallied from its early lows. At 1556 GMT the FTSE 100
was down just 4.7 points at 1,984.9 after a low of 1,977.2 at
1354 GMT.
    Dealers said most in the market appear to expect share
prices to move higher tomorrow, but volume will remain
relatively light ahead of an announcement of the election date.
    They said given the thin trading conditions the market's
movements will be volatile in the coming few sessions.

<TITLE>FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
intervene in the government securities market to supply
temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from
1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal
pressures on bank reserves.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday, opened at
6-1/8 pct and remained there in early trading.

<TITLE>LONDON MONEY MARKET CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Money market interest rates closed little
changed after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K.
Base lending rates fizzled out, dealers said.
    Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party
well ahead had little effect on the market with operators
looking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling
continued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in
Washington this week.
    One senior money broker commented, "What we want is an
election date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the
market knows what's happening then we can move forward."
    The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10
pct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date
of a general election is making for cautious trading, dealers
said.
    Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set to
retain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and
fuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates.
    The British authorities are likely to remain cautious,
however, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review
their February Paris accord on currency stability. This could
affect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in
trade weighted terms to stand at 72.3.
    Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the
day-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of
England. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, which
have a maturity of between two and three months were
transacted. Today, however, these again appeared but the
majority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to
two months range.
    The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged
quoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until
fresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say they
expect the market to continue around these levels with only
technical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates.
    The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the
system today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite
this, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range
having started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct.
    Period interbank rates were little changed with six months
quoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct.
    Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine
months ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct
respectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from
late yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three
months at 9-17/32 15/32 pct.
