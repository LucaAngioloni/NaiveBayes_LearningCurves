<TITLE>FIDATA &lt;FID> ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY ESM SETTLEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fidata Corp &lt;FID> and its subsidiary,
Fidata Trust Company New York &lt;FTCNY>, announced that they have
reached a preliminary settlement agreement in principle in the
lawsuits filed by major parties arising out of the E.S.M.
Government Securities, Inc bankruptcy.
    Fidata Corp said that it anticipates that the cost of the
proposed settlement, after anticipated recoveries, will be less
than 4 mln dlrs, and possibly significantly less.
    The major terms of the settlement agreement, applicable to
Fidata and FTCNY, provide for the release by Fidata of its
claims to 1.125 mln dlrs held by the ESM estate, and the
further payment of 8.425 mln dlrs for distribution to the
public body plaintiffs and Home State Savings Bank.
    Fidata said it expects to recover along with its subsidiary
at least half of the sums to be paid under the terms of the
agreement, and potentially amounts substantially in excess of
that.

<TITLE>LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. refiners will have to
reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here.
     "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
petroluem products at Conoco Inc
    "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added.
     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
ended March 20.
     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
API said.
     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
&lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
     "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
continues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.
subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
the current level of demand but the operating level should
increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
Buckler said.
     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.
refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude
per day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
over the next five years," he said, adding that these
facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude
oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to
refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.

<TITLE>SONY INCREASING PRODUCTION ABROAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> will increase production
abroad to overcome falling profits caused by the yen's rise
against the dollar, managing board chairman Akio Morita told
the West German newspaper Die Welt.
    He was quoted as saying that Sony, whose latest profit
figures had been affected strongly by dollar fluctuations,
would increase production in the U.S. And Europe.
    Several production facilities were being built, he added.
"At the same time we are also investing capital in order to
modernise our locations and raise our productivity."
    Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems,
Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live less
from exports and more from domestic demand.
    He said U.S. And European companies had made the mistake of
not investing enough in the future, which was why they had lost
their lead in consumer electronics.
    "They may spend a lot of money on research and development,"
he said. "But planning and marketing are very important sectors
in developing a marketable product."
    "If they don't spend money on these, they can't build up new
business lines."
    Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience in
penetrating the Japanese market, Morita said "Naturally, I have
to admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan."
    On the other hand, many foreign firms were too interested
in short-term success, he said.
    "If, therefore, a company comes to Japan and wants to make a
profit at once on this market, it is not so simple."
    "These people then complain, while the successful firms keep
their mouths shut," Morita said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate has approved a
measure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks
to write off loan losses over ten years.
    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was
attached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.
    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks
with assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of
total loans in farm loans -- to write down over ten years
agricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE BUDGET CHIEF EYES FARM POLICY CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Lawton Chiles' (D-Fla.) fiscal 1988 budget plan would
cut farm spending by about two billion dlrs, primarily by
making unspecified changes in price and income support
programs, Senate staff members said.
    Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week and
said he would like to begin voting on it this week.
    Senate Republican staff members said Chiles was
recommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.
    While savings from the changes would accrue mainly in
fiscal 1989, Chiles said his income and price support proposals
would trim about two billion dlrs from advance deficiency
payments, most of which would be made in the spring of next
year.
    It was not clear how the Senate Budget panel head would
achieve the savings in Commodity Credit Corp outlays. Aides to
Chiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.
    Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a report
listing possible price and income support program savings.
    The options included lowering target prices, increasing
unpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income support
payments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use of
generic commodity certificates, raising loan rates and
"decoupling" income support payments from production decisions.
    Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing the
U.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functions
which include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.
    The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrs
for organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid.

<TITLE>NEWMONT MINING &lt;NEM> SEEKS SOUTH AFRICAN SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp will seek
favorable terms for sale of its South African investments, the
proxy statement for its annual meeting said.
    Recommending that shareholders vote against a proposal
calling expeditious withdrawal from South Africa, the proxy
said "a quick sale could be akin to abandonment" because of the
depressed state of metal mining stocks and exchange rates on
capital withdrawals from South Africa.
    The proxy said the company gave close consideration to
alternatives to the continued holdings of four existing South
African metal mining investments during the past year.
    Pointing out "a measurable number of investors incline to
support" resolutions calling for South African divestment as
part of their effort to avoid pressure to sell a given stock,
the company said "this largely unspoken agenda of many
supporters of disinvestment does receive attention by the
corporation."
    Because of this, Newmont Mining said it "is prepared to
consider, and will seek, favorable terms for sale of its South
African investments," but asked stockholders to reject the
resolution calling for withdrawal and leave the matter to the
continuing judgment of management.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its
worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a
company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here said.
    He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the
capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining
centers
in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United
States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a
subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP>.
    Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La
refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland
Corp &lt;SLC>.
     According to the official, Venezuela is searching
worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not
mention where the company was looking. 
    Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for
Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to
refiners.
    He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of
crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.

<DATELINE>    TROY, MICH., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audi of America Inc said it
introduced the "Audi Private Purchase Plan" in which it will
offer 5,000 dlr purchase certificates exclusively to current
owners of 1984-86 Audi 5000 vehicles.
    It said owners must apply the certificates toward purchase
or lease of any new 1987 Audi 5000 series vehicle.
    The program will run between April 1 and June 30, and more
than 150,000 certificates will be mailed.
    A company spokesman said eligible owners need not trade in
their old cars to take advantage of the offer.
    He also said the scheme was not prompted by the fact that
Audi had to recall thousands of its cars earlier this year to
correct a possible defect that caused some of the cars to
accelerate suddenly.

<TITLE>BASS GROUP SAYS IT HAS HAD TALKS ON TAFT &lt;TFB></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group led by members of the
wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, which holds a 24.9
pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, said it has had talks about
taking part in a move to take control of the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it has had discussions with other Taft
stockholders and some company managers and directors
"concerning participation in a group to acquire control" of the
company.
    The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other
people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to
continue evaluating Taft and "will be involved in further
discussions relating to the future control and direction" of
the company.
    The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said
its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may
decide to sell some or all of its stake.
    On Friday Taft said it would negotiate with a group led by
its vice chairman, Dudley Taft, and a Rhode Island investment
firm, which had offered 150 dlrs a share for the company.
    The Dudley Taft group, Theta Corp, which also includes
Narragansett Capital Corp, a Providence, R.I., investment firm,
is seeking to take the company private in a leveraged buyout
valued at 1.38 billion dlrs.
    Besides the Bass group, another major Taft shareholder,
Cincinnati, Ohio, financier Carl Lindner, has also said he has
had talks about increasing his stake in the company, taking
part in a takeover effort, or launching one himself.
    Lindner controls 1,489,298 shares of Taft common stock, or
16.2 pct of the total.

<TITLE>HIGH COURT DECLINES TO REVIEW AIR BAG RULE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court declined to review
a federal regulation requiring automobile manufacturers to
phase in automatic seat belts or air bags for new cars sold in
the United States.
    The Department of Transportation (DOT) rule required that
the safety devices be installed, for the first time, on 10 pct
of this year's model cars. All new cars must have the devices
by the 1990-model year.
    The regulation, however, can be rescinded if states with
two-thirds of the U.S. population adopt mandatory seat belt-use
laws by 1989.

<TITLE>TRADE BODY SETS NEW RULES FOR EURODLR MANAGERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears."
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations," he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrower
says to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'" he said.

<TITLE>TRANSAMERICAN FILES AMENDED REORGANIZATION PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp, which
has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
January 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiated
plan of reorganization.
    A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas.
    Basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated plan
have not changed from the original plan filed last October, the
company said.
     The amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents to
the plan filed in October, it said.
    Assuming the plan is found adequate on April 29,
TransAmerican would then seek acceptance from creditors which
is relatively assured since they participated in the
negotiations, the company said.
    Liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are being
reorganized under the amended plan which provides for full
debt-repayment to secured bank lenders.
    Unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment,
secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25
to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation of
the plan by the court.
    TransAmerican is vigorously resisting efforts by Coastal
Corp &lt;CGP> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan of
liquidation.
    The spokesman said the company is confident its plan will
be confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from Chapter
11 as early ninety days after the April 29 confirmation.
    A Coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in April with
the court and will request the court to review its plan.
    On March 17, the company said that as a creditor, which is
owed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan which
will better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.
    A TransAmerican spokesman said the net worth of Coastal's
offer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value of
Transamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.

<TITLE>TEXTRON &lt;TXT> TO REPAY DEBT THROUGH ASSET SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texton Inc said it intends to
repay a substantial portion of the debt generated to acquire
Ex-Cell-O Corp last year through internally generated cash and
proceeds from the sale of assets.
    Textron financed the acquisition by borrowing about one
billion dlrs under promissory notes, subsequently refinanced
through the sale of commercial paper and bank borrowings.
    The large diversified conglomerate with operations ranging
from defense to consumer and financial services, said in its
annual report that it has not yet identified the units, other
than its Gorham division, it expects to sell.
    Textron said it did expect to identify the units it intends
to sell during the next year. It said the sales are expected to
reduce income from continuing operations as the units' earnings
will exceed the interest on the debt retired with the proceeds
of the sales.
    It also said it plans to "return to a more conservative
balance sheet ratio of debt-to-capital," through asset sales
and increasing cash flow from continuing operations.
    It also said it will continue to examine "large acquisition
opportunities," while "pruning" operations no longer expected
to meet its strategic requirements.

<TITLE>NEWMONT MINING &lt;NEM> SETS HIGHER SPENDING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp estimates its 1987
capital spending at 137 mln dlrs, its annual report said.
    A company spokesman said this figure excludes &lt;Magma Copper
Co> and compares to spending of about 80 mln dlrs in 1986
excluding the 45 mln dlrs spent on Magma operations. As
previously announced, Newmont is distributing 80 pct of Magma's
stock to its shareholders in the form of a dividend.
    The report also said Newmont Mining increased its ownership
of Du Pont Co &lt;DD> stock during 1986 to 5,970,141 shares at
year end from 5,250,376 shares a year earlier.
    Newmont's annual report said the company held 2.5 pct of Du
Pont's stock at the end of 1986, up from 2.2 pct a year
earlier.
    The report also said Newmont's proven oil reserves declined

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed Banner Industries Inc's 135 mln dlrs of B-minus
subordinated debt following its purchase of Rexnord Inc. 
    Rexnord's 50 mln dlrs of 12-3/4 pct debentures of 1994 were
cut to B from A-minus to reflect the merger with Banner.
    While increasing Banner's size and diversity, S and P said
the transaction heightens financial risk, with debt to capital
rising to more than 90 pct.
    Near-term earnings and cash flow protection will weaken
from the acquisition, though Banner's plans to sell some
Rexnord assets will reduce debt for the medium term.

<TITLE>LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas' cotton crop stands little
chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in
that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according
to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.
    "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct
of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,
a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in
Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had
begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with
planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to
begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for
60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,
Stillmann said.
    Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop
to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande
Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,
according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.
    The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures
market rallied today on weather-related fears.

in very good condition, acccording to the latest report by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Florida Agricultural
Statistics Service. Late-week rains and thunderstorms came at
an opportune time. Warm daytime temperatures and good soil
moisture have produced an abundance of new growth and bloom.
    Most trees are in some stage of bloom development with
petal drop already taking place in many south Florida groves.
    Harvest of late-type valencia oranges is increasing rapidly
with the near completion of the early and midseason varieties.
Rain during the week caused some delay in picking.
    For the week ended March 29, there were an estimated 77,000
boxes of early and midseason and 945,000 boxes of late season
oranges harvested, the USDA said.

analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
broadcasting company.
    The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
and directors "concerning participation in a group to acquire
control" of the company.
    The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
any of the other people with whom it had talks.
    Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
dlr offer for the company.
    At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
    "If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
backing him on any deal," said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
    "I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
they're going to join the group and buy themselves out," said
Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co.
    Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
    Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
    Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values
for the company.
    Several analysts had estimated a break up value of less
than 150. One analyst said he believes it has a breakup value
of 160 to 165 dlrs per share.
    Taft stock closed at 156-1/2, up 1-3/4.
    "They (investors) are saying here's another one - another
family dispute," said Dennis McAlpine of Oppenheimer.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> U.S. RIG COUNT FALLS TO 748</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sharp cutbacks in drilling in Oklahoma
and Kansas pushed the U.S. drilling rig count down by 36 to a
total of 748, against 1,034 working rigs one year ago, Hughes
Tool Co said.
    The latest weekly count of rig activity reversed last
week's gain of 23 rigs for a total of 784, which had been the
first improvement in the drilling rig count this year.
    "I have no explanation for the decline," said Hughes
economist Ike Kerridge. "I think we're near the bottom of this
year's rig count but the wet ground in northern and
midcontinent states could affect the count in the next few
weeks."
    Among individual states, Oklahoma and Kansas reported
declines of 16 and 11 working rigs last week. Texas lost seven
and Michigan and Wyoming were each down by three rigs. Gains
were reported in Louisiana and California, which increased by
seven and six, respectively.
    In Canada, the rig count dropped by 52 to a total of 131
working rigs, against 222 one year ago. Kerridge attributed the
steep drop to the government's annual springtime ban against
rigs and other heavy equipment being transported over
rain-softened highways.

<TITLE>U.S. TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS JAPAN ACTION FOOLISH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>A high level U.S. trade official
said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the
United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor
electronics products.
    Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
Smart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness."
    In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.
    Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.
    President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from
the two Democratic leaders of Congress.
    "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright
of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
session, "It just shows we were right all along when we said
something needs doing."
    Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.
negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.
    Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last
year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the
United States in these products.
    Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.
    "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I
hope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of the
White House trade sanctions.
    The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw
them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.
    "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them
we can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said.
    Measured per car, each American-made car contained about
700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car
contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.

<TITLE>U.S. BILL AUCTION RATES AVERAGE 5.72, 5.80 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said its weekly
auction of bills produced an average rate of 5.72 pct for the
three-month and 5.80 pct for six-month bills.
    These rates compared with averages of 5.55 pct for each of
the three- and six-month bills sold last week.
    The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills was 5.90
pct. Accepted bids ranges from 5.70 pct to 5.74 pct and 14 pct
of the bids at the high, or stopout rate, were taken. For six
months, the yield was 6.07 pct and the bids were at 5.80 pct.
    The Treasury said it received 24.9 billion dlrs of bids for
the three-month bills, including 1.0 billion dlrs in
non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.4 billion
dlrs of bids, including 2.0 billion dlrs from the Federal
Reserve and 161 mln dlrs from foreign and international
monetary authorities.
    Some 28.0 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were
received, including 780 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The
Treasury accepted 6.4 billion dlrs, including 1.8 billion dlrs
from the Fed and 1.1 billion dlrs from foreign and
international authorities.
    The average price for the three-month bills was 98.554 and
prices ranged from 98.559 to 98.549.  The average price for the
six-months bills was 97.068.
    The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest
since February 9, when it was also 5.72 pct. The average yield
on the six-month bills was the highest since 5.89 pct on July
28 last year.

<TITLE>RJR NABISCO &lt;RJR> SAYS TOBACCO SPINOFF UNLIKELY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>RJR Nabisco Inc said it is
unlikely that it will spin off any of its tobacco operations
into a master limited partnership in the "immediately
foreseeable future."
    But the company, which has said was studying proposals to
transfer at least a portion of its tobacco business to a master
limited partnership, said in a 10-K filing that it will
continue "on an ongoing basis to study all aspects of the
business, including the role, if any, of an MLP, with a view
toward maximizing shareholder value."
    F. Ross Johnson, president and chief operating officer,
said in a statement, "After careful study, we concluded that
the possible benefits of an MLP do not at this time justify the
management time and attention that would have to be devoted to
the transfer to a new and difficult operating structure."
    In February, RJR Nabisco said it was studying a possible
spinoff of its tobacco business to a master limited
partnership. At that time, the company, which also has a large
food business, said at that the tobacco business was not
posting the same level of profits as its food operations.
    A company spokesman said RJR Nabisco will evaluate  a range
of options for the tobacco business other than the formation of
a master limited partnership. He declined, however, to say what
those options might be.
    The spokesman also refused to elaborate on what factors
went into the company's decision not to spinoff the tobacco
operations.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM DISASTER BILL ATTRACTS AMENDMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senators are considering offering a
host of amendments to a farm disaster assistance bill which
could come up soon on the Senate floor, staff members said.
    The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987
winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern flooding
last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income
support payments even if they did not plant.
    Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)
would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program crops
or, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.
    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)
were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains
producers to receive final deficiency payments in March instead
of in October.
    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiency
payments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately
three billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting
instead of in the fall.
    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment that
would offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers
for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation
reserve program last year.
    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up
for the corn program this spring. The U.S. Agriculture
Department has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn
bonus offer.
    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplating
an amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheat
producers who were prevented from planting this spring because
of flooding last year.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that would
allow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the quality
of their crop was hurt by flooding last year.
    Democrats and Republicans today were still trying to arrive
at an agreement governing time to be devoted to amendments.

<TITLE>FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve's move to easier
monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate
cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the
second quarter, analysts said.
    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.
    "The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
a full-blown recession," said Raymond Stone, chief financial
economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said
it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half
point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.
    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which
banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime
lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.
    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to
the April-June quarter, follow:
    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget
deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after
the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the
economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.
    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
test the lower end of that range.
    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong
foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The
outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.
    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The
sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will
a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct
annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at
respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first
and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct
annual
rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct
rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this
quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.
    "The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
expect," Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in
inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter
economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.
    "We're running out of special factors to keep the economy
afloat," said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His
interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.
He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second
quarter growth could be zero or negative.
    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow 
government spending and less construction. Only a marginally
narrower trade deficit will add to growth.
    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,
with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,
respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for
bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past
days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.
    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20
pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.
    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted
his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and
Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.
    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear
about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.
trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS DIFFER WIDELY ON FARM PRICE PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers gave widely diverging reactions to EC executive
Commission proposals for a radical reduction of guaranteed
prices for the EC's 12 mln farmers.
    The plans, which could cut the price received by farmers by
over 10 pct in many cases, were dismissed by West German
minister Ignaz Kiechle as in part unacceptable and in part not
even a basis for negotiation, diplomatic sources said.
    At the other end of the scale, Britain's Michael Jopling
said for some products they did not go far enough to reduce the
massive spending on the EC's farm policy, the major factor
which has brought the Community close to a budget crisis.
    Ministers discussed the Commission's 1987-88 farm price
proposals for the first time and the sources said negotiations
could last several months yet.
    Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker, who is chairing the
meeting, told his colleagues he would not even attempt to reach
agreement at the current meeting which is due to end Tuesday
although prices are supposed to be agreed by April 1.
    The disagreement among ministers reflects deep divisions
among member states about the future of the EC's farm policy
which swallows about two-thirds of the annual 36 billion
European Currency Unit (41 billion dollar) budget.
    Kiechle, backed generally by his French, Italian and
several other colleagues, believes sacrifices by traditional
family farmers must be kept to a minimum in order to maintain
viable rural communities in Europe.
    Jopling, with some support from the Netherlands and
Denmark, on the whole backs proposals by EC farm commissioner
Frans Andriessen to cut guaranteed prices and reduce the
opportunities for sales of surplus products into EC stores.
    He believes the system which allows such sales nominally as
a last resort has become abused, resulting in huge stocks and
damaging trade tensions with other major world food exporters.
    Jopling told journalists it was now costing the EC 2,000
Ecus a hectare (920 dlrs an acre) to subsidise cotton
production and double that figure for the growing of certain
types of tobacco.
    Opening yesterday's debate, Andriessen accused officials of
some EC states of ignoring realities. "They give the impression
of living on another planet where there are no surpluses, no
budgetary deficits and no budgetary discipline for farm
spending," he said.
    One Andriessen scheme for closing the budget gap could
already be doomed, diplomats said.
    He wants to raise two billion Ecus (2.28 billion dlrs)
through a tax on EC produced and imported oilseeds which has
already raised hackles in Washington because of fears of the
impact on U.S. soybean exports.
    Jopling said earlier enough EC states appear opposed to
this scheme to block its adoption provided they all stand firm
in the lengthy negotiations ahead on the Commission proposals.

    A snowstorm caused some cattle deaths in the Panhandle, and
cold, wet weather covered many areas. Windy weather followed to
dry fields and limit planting delays.
    Small grains made good progress despite cool temperatures
which slowed growth. Additional moisture was needed in some
areas. Many fields were booting and some were beginning to
head. Wheat was rated 16 pct fair, 56 pct good and 28 pct
excellent.
    Corn and sorghum planting progressed, and land preparation
was ahead of schedule in the Plains despite snowy weather.
Cotton planting progressed in the Lower Valley.

<TITLE>U.S. DOT APPROVES AMERICAN &lt;AMR>-ACI &lt;ACF> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
Airlines Inc.
    "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," the
DOT said in a statement.
    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
unit of AMR Corp.
    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
Feb. 20.
    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
increase or begin service that competed with a merged
American-AirCal.
    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at the
Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
long-haul markets," the DOT said.
    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
building limit future opportunities for expansion.
    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
opposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."
    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. credit market ended under
extreme pressure as the dollar's continued slide on the
currency markets triggered an avalanche of U.S. securities
sales, pushing prices to 1987 lows, dealers and analysts said.
    "This was a bloodbath," said one money market economist.
"We've been trading in a state of total panic at times today,"
said another.
    Mirroring the dollar's fall to a 40-year low against the
yen, the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price fell nearly
two points to close at 96-7/32, compared with 98-5/32 on
Friday. The corresponding yield jumped to 7.83 pct from 7.66.

<TITLE>FORMER OWNER SENTENCED IN OHIO THRIFT COLLAPSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Marvin Warner, a former U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland, was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in jail
for his role in a bank failure that led to the worst banking
crisis in Ohio's history.
    He owned the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati at the
time of its March 9, 1985, collapse following more than 143 mln
dlrs in loses.
    Warner and two other bank officials were charged with 82
counts of misapplying the bank's funds by transferring them to
ESM Government Securities Inc., of Florida without the
authorization of the bank's board.
    ESM collapsed in March of 1985, taking Home State -- its
biggest investor -- down with it.
    Home State's failure wiped out the reserves of its insurer,
the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a state regulated institution
that was not federally insured. That prompted a run on dozens
of other savings and loan associations across the state which
were insured by the same fund, forcing some of them to close
until they obtained federal deposit insurance.
    Warner was ambassador to Switzerland during the Carter
administration.

(MIDAM) moved from the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor
to a room off the main trading floors of the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBT) today and expanded trading hours for Treasury-bond
futures to 0720 to 1515 CST.
    CBT bond futures continue to trade from 0800 to 1400 CST.
    The MIDAM was founded last century as the Chicago Open
Board of Trade as a grain exchange and has since expanded to
include smaller contracts of livestock, currencies, metals and
financial futures.
    MIDAM traders said the new CBT facilities worked well
today, offering more inter-market spread opportunities in two
trading pits than on the old floor which they believed was too
large for the volume of trade.

<TITLE>EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Development of costly shale oil,
liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in
recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,
will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a
barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.
    Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after
addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers, "By early in the next century, synthetics
should play a significant role in this country's energy
supply."
    McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he
believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when
world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.
    "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil
prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be
prepared," McMillan said.
    He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct
annually in the next few years while the nation fails to
replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of
the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher
because of declining supplies, McMillan said.
    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the
meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help
spur development of synthetic fuels.
    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons
of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that
of all the world's known oil reserves.
    "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels
competitive later," Hall said. The average lead time for
development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between
five and ten years.
    Until last year, the federal government had subsidized
synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a
research program created during the Carter Administration with
the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels
of oil.
    The corporation was shut down last April when Congress
refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget
because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a
barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

report said cold weather slowed crop development and caused

Fields in the west were short of nitrogen, and moderate insect
activity was noted in the southwest region.
    Wheat condition was rated 15 pct fair, 84 pct good and one
pct excellent.
    Row crop activity was very slow amid wet conditions.
Topsoil moisture was rated 30 pct adequate and 70 pct surplus,
and subsoil moisture was rated 100 pct adequate. Only two days
were suitable for fieldwork.

<TITLE>BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rene Villegas, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian President Jose Sarney
announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of
U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at
promoting imports of foreign goods.
    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
purchase of goods."
    The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is
technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in
the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above
the official rate.
    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery
and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the
parallel market without having to wait for an official order
from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).
    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
economy.
    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's
trade policy, with participation of the private sector.
    The Council had been closed three years ago by the military
government of former President Joao Figueiredo.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anglo American Gold Investment Co
chairman Julian Thompson urged the South African government to
repeal legislation preventing black advancement in the mining
industry.
    Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the mining
industry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intends
to remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilled
jobs.
    He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing a
bill when parliament reconvenes later this year.
    The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners are
black but whites perform most supervisory jobs.
    The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to all
races this year but the mining industry fears clauses inserted
in an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult for
blacks to qualify for skilled positions.
    "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatory
provisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies them
opportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompson
said.

<TITLE>CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By Peter Cooney, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's major banks will likely face
stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing
if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the
end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.
    American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt
talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks
would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.
    Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian
banks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank
analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.
    "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said
Pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing
basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot
of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering
the loans non-performing and another bank is not."
    Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any
willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp
&lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than
let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling
example for other creditor banks.
    "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have
to have the support of the other banks," said Meredith.
    Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd
said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,
"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis
and is trying to encourage the others to take that position."
    Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs
by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on
its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
    Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days
before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest
as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.
They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until
late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending
July 31.
    &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank
creditor, said last week it was not currently considering
declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as
non-performing.
    "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walsh
said of Bank of Montreal's statement. 
    Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian
banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans
non-performing.
    They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by
the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks
to recoup their lost interest income.
    "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks
will get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is
optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's
earnings."
    Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of
3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in
1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25
dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with
2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,
and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.
    She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada>
against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.
    Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings
estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,
assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.
    "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the
fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a
share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said.
    Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the
Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on
beyond one full fiscal year."
    He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings
forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly
interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs
or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA PLANS METALS INVESTMENT FOR 1987-89</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG,
which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other
industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects
during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella
announced.
    The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure
and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the
mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river.
    Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12
companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits,
which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion
bolivars last year.
    Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which
earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor
turned a profit.
    The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of
1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt.
    CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial
gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material
alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln
bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's
412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042
to 1.504 bln bolivars.
    Meanwhile, the state iron company Ferrominera saw its
profits rise from 156 mln bolivars in 1985 to 204 mln bolivars
last year.

<TITLE>SARNEY TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rene Villegas, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian President Jose Sarney
announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of
U.S. Dollar currency in the parallel market, aimed at promoting
imports of foreign goods.
    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
purchase of goods."
    The parallel market, although tolerated, is technically
illegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market
is being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate.
    Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers of
machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in
the parallel market without having to wait for the issuing of
an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department (Cacex).
    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
economy.
    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's
trade policy, with participation of the private sector.
    The Council had been closed three years ago by the military
government of former President Joao Figueiredo.
    Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion
dollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials
have suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to
seek a renegotiation with its creditors.
    Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a
must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12
billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which
dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars.
    He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade
balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised
countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis
faced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.

<TITLE>SEC WINS EXTENSION OF ORDERS AGAINST VASKEVITCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Sweet granted requests by federal authorities for court orders
freezing the assets of former Merrill Lynch executive Nahum
Vaskevitch, who has been charged with insider trading.
    Acting on arguments by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Sweet issued a preliminary injunction barring
Vaskevitch and other defendants in the case from committing
further violations of U.S. securities law.
    He also issued orders freezing the defendants' U.S. assets,
forcing them to give a full accounting of their assets and
preventing any alteration or destruction of documents.
    The orders merely extend indefinitely the effectiveness of
temporary restraining orders the SEC obtained against
Vaskevitch on March 11, when it charged him with masterminding
an insider trading scheme that netted him and his associates
more than four mln dlrs in illegal profits.
    Vaskevitch, who headed the mergers and acquisitions
department of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Ltd, the
London branch of the brokerage giant, leaked inside information
about 12 companies to his associates, the SEC charged.
    Also charged were David Sofer, an Israeli, and two firms he
and Vaskevitch used. All reside outside U.S. territory.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> REJECTS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, OHio, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gencorp Inc said its board urged
shareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a share
tender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, an
affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.
    Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
full value of the company.
    In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
said the offer is a "highly conditional, contingently financed
bust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
of their investment in Gencorp.
    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
said the board has authorized management to explore
alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
"financially superior" alternative to the general acquisition
offer.
    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
comment on market speculation that the company's management may
develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
joined the company.
    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price"
acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banks
that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide."
    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
shareholders.
    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
"jeopardizes the security and interests" of its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
the country where the company's facilities are located.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES TO REPAY SOME PRINCIPAL IN 1987-89</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine government has quietly
agreed to make token payments of principal in each of the next
three years as part of its 10.3 billion dlr commercial bank
debt rescheduling package finalized last Friday, bankers said.
    Manila will pay foreign banks 37 mln dlrs a year in 1987,
1988 and 1989, representing four pct of a 925 mln dlr loan
signed in 1985. Amortizations on the loan were not due to begin
until 1990, but the Philippines agreed to make the extra 111
mln dlr prepayment in order to win a relatively low interest
margin of 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, bankers said.
    Bankers said they insisted on the principal repayments so
that they could justify a margin of 7/8 pct by drawing a direct
parallel between the Philippines and Venezuela, which won a 7/8
pct spread on a 21 billion dlr debt rescheduling package last
month.
    After the Venezuelan deal was clinched, leading New York
bankers hurried to argue that 7/8 pct was the new benchmark
spread for a debtor nation that was current on interest, was
not seeking new money and was amortizing loan principal.
    Previously, the 13/16 pct margin granted to Mexico was seen
by debtors as the margin to strive for.
    The Philippines, which met the first two Venezuelan
criteria but not the third, was adamant that it could not
accept a spread higher than 7/8 pct.
    Bankers could not back down either because they would have
had to sacrifice millions of dollars in profits and may have
thrown the door open to other debtors, notably Argentina and
Brazil, to claim even finer spreads than Mexico's.
    In the end, the compromise saved face for the banks. "The
banks were agonizing how to reconcile this package with
Venezuela's. This allowed them to walk out and say, We've kept
faith with the Venezuelan precedent," one source said.
    The prepayments, although modest, were not apparently
something that the Philippine negotiators wanted to dwell upon
as they sought to portray their 17-year rescheduling agreement
as better than Mexico's.
    Finance minister Jaime Ongpin did not refer to the
prepayments at a news conference he held in New York on Friday
to announce the rescheduling agreement.
    And an accompanying press release referred only obliquely
to the fact that the 7/8 pct margin will increase to one pct
"as long as the Philippines pays amortizations as agreed with
the banks."
    The threat of a higher margin gives the Philippines every
incentive to make the extra payments, and the government has
indicated that it will in fact do so, bankers said.
    Furthermore, by paying back ahead of schedule some of the
last loan it raised, the Philippines will be hoping to make a
good impression on the international banking community.
    Ongpin said the country should not have a financing gap
before the end of next year at the earliest, depending on the
success of the Philippine Investment Note issues which are
planned, but some bankers say they are already braced for new
loan requests for 1988 and 1989.

<TITLE>U.S. SHOULD REASSESS MIDEAST POLICY - ANALYST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. should reassess
its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"
Ebinger said.
     He remarks were made in an address to the National
Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
interests," Ebinger said.
     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
weaker if demand falls in the spring.
    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
to restrict production.
    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to
four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to
two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.

Commission is investigating possible market manipulation of
securities in which Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc was market
maker, the brokerage firm said.
    The SEC has obtained a "formal order of investigation"
relating to possible manipulation of the Securities of Hammer
Technologies Inc &lt;HAMM> and related companies, Shearson said.
    While the firm did not say whether it was a target of the
probe, it said some of its employees will testify before the
SEC in the matter.
    Hammer Technologies is a Larkspur, Calif., holding company
dealing in sales and rentals of video tapes, recorders,
televisions, computer products and related equipment.
    The disclosure was made in documents detailing a planned
public offering of 20.5 mln shares of Shearson Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc common stock by American Express Co &lt;AXP>, which
currently owns the brokerage firm and would continue to hold a
controlling interest in it after the stock offering.
    The company did not not elaborate on the SEC probe.
    An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, noting
the agency's policy against confirming or denying any probes.

<TITLE>ARGENTINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financing talks here between the
Argentine government and its bank advisory committee are finely
poised, with the two sides still separated on the critical
question of interest-rate spreads, bankers said.
    Argentina is pressing for a margin of 13/16 pct over the
London Interbank Offered Rate, the same rate as on Mexico's
recent new-loan and rescheduling package, but the banks are
refusing, they said.
    Negotiations continued in New York today, even though
Finance Secretary Mario Brodersohn has returned to Argentina to
consult president Raul Alfonsin on the proposed terms.
    After the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion
dlr loan, bankers feel that they could not sell a package for
Argentina with a margin of 13/16 pct. They are holding out for
a spread close to one pct, with 7/8 pct - the rate won by
Venezuela and the Philippines - as their rock-bottom offer.
    "What they're looking at and what we've got on the table
are not that far apart," one banker said.
    Bankers said that Argentina is seeking to stretch out
principal repayments on upcoming public-sector debt maturities
for 19 years and is looking for a 13-year loan from the banks
to cover the bulk of its 2.15 billion dlr new-money need.

<TITLE>JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate fell to 2.9 pct in February from the record 3.0 pct in
January, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    The January level was the worst since the Goverment started
compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in
1953.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 1.86 mln people,
up from 1.82 mln in January and 1.64 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in February remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-highest level set in January and December. Record
male unemployment of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment rose to a record 3.1 pct in February
from the previous record 3.0 pct marked in January 1987 and in
April, August, September and December last year.
    "Japan's employment condition was still severe in February
as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only
0.03 percentage points to 2.93 pct from 2.96 pct in January," an
agency official said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430,000 from a
year earlier to 14.22 mln people in February due to the yen's
continued appreciation, while employment in non-manufacturing
industries rose 380,000 to 12.11 mln.
    In manufacturing industries, employment in the textile
industry fell 180,000 to 1.94 mln in February, while in
ordinary and precision machinery industries it fell 160,000 to
1.50 mln.

<TITLE>PARTNERS CALL GENCORP&lt;GY> RESPONSE UNPRODUCTIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Acquisition Co said it was
disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and
questioned how the company might give better value to
shareholders.
    Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per
share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner
and Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it was
studying financially superior alternatives.
   The partnership called the response inflammatory and
unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss
the offer with Gencorp.
     The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to
prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison
pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make
takeovers more expensive.
    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its
rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended
to April six from April three. It said the extension was
subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned
on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of
Gencorp prior to April six.
    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be
completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.
    The partnership in its statement again urged management to
work with it to facilitate a transaction.

<TITLE>DLR BELOW 150 YEN COUNTER TO PARIS PACT - MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he
regards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement
struck by major nations in Paris last month.
    He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that
Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150
yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level
counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.
    Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa
said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.
    Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to
hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year
today, Miyazawa said.
    Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception
that major nations were not doing enough to implement their
policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of
Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.
    He said that now was the time for major nations to act
under the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,
Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to
prop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.

end-February from 6.28 billion in January and compared with
7.12 billion in February 1986, the central bank said.
    A bank official said the increase came mainly from growing
OBU borrowings by Taiwanese operators from their Asian
counterparts.
    He said the assets, held by 15 foreign and local banks,
were mainly in U.S. Dollars, with the rest in certificates of
deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia
and the rest from North America and Europe, he added.

<TITLE>U.S. MAY DROP TARIFFS IF JAPAN OPENS UP - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on
Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an
agreement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.
    "But there has to be a clear indication that they are
willing to act," he said.
    Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are
problems "they have brought on themselves."
    The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.
    "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
turmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we have
gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred
for only a few weeks or months in Japan."
    The tariffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will
affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny
fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.
    Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. We
don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"
Yeutter said.
    Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in
Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
will include "some difficult items on the agenda."
    Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part
semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.
    Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has
failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has
failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries,
undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO DEVELOP FIGHTER PLANE WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has decided to cooperate with the
U.S. To develop a new generation of fighter planes, Defence
Minister Yuko Kurihara said.
    Japan is now in a major trade dispute with Washington, but
Kurihara told reporters the decision was not made in response
to outside pressure and described the project as a Japanese-led
program with U.S. Cooperation.
    President Ronald Reagan said last week that the U.S. Would
impose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate against
alleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact.
    The plane, codenamed the FSX, has been the focus of
competition between Japanese and U.S. Defence contractors. At
stake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts which
the Japanese government had previously intended to award to
domestic firms.
    The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's self
defence forces, will be equipped with high technology radar
dodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very low
altitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.
    The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all
77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.
    A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of the
announcement had nothing to do with escalating trade friction
between Japan and the U.S., Its largest trading partner.
    "This is an objective decision, made after discussions with
U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger," he said.
    However, with two weeks to go before the U.S. Imposes
tariffs, Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, told
Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must address
individual market-opening issues, such as the FSX, defence
ministry officials said.

13.4 pct from a year earlier to 109,254, the 10th successive

    February housing starts were up 16.8 pct from 93,554 in
January when they fell 27.4 pct from a month earlier but rose
10.3 pct from a year earlier.
    Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 26.8 pct
year-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51,829 for
the 56th consecutive gain, spurred primarily by lower domestic
interest rates.

<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Woodside Petroleum Ltd &lt;WPLA.S> said
its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices
combined with a large tax provision.
    Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to
17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group
revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.
    It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit
but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely
related to its &lt;Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses
and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not
recognised in the accounts.
    Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full
year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the
Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.
    Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas
and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.
    Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd
&lt;STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas.
    Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale
would be included in the 1987 accounts.
    It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6
mln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.

<TITLE>CHINA GETS RARE CRITICISM DURING PEOPLE'S CONGRESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Nisbet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charges of public sector waste,
corruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid the
compliments in debates at the annual session of China's
parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).
    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the China
International Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), who
also represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the "profit before
everything" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlement
and extravagant gifts and banquets.
    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.
    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members on
Premier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.
    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provinces
said Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.
One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pct
of total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today.
"This is incompatible with the important place occupied by
agriculture," he said.
    Other deputies said the state had broken promises to
improve fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.
    Although another congress member was quoted by the agency
as saying Zhao's opening speech last week was "discreet,
appropriate, comprehensive and assuring," others said the
government had spent too much or too little.
    One member, described as a person with no party
affiliation, said people were worried about the state's budget
deficit, projected to reach more than two billion dlrs this
year.
    "The deficit is due not only to the sharp drop in oil price,
but also to lavishness and waste of funds, which should be
stopped," he said.
    "The National People's Congress used to be a rubber stamp,
but now it is a little bit more than that," said a western
diplomat, referring to the range of debate.
    Another western diplomat said the Communist Party had
granted a slightly greater role to the Congress in the last two
or three years and some of its members were testing out their
influence.
    The committee's decision to strike from the agenda a
controversial plan to give greater power to management of state
enterprises and less to local party committees caused raised
eyebrows, the diplomat added.
    One diplomat said Zhao's keynote speech could emerge in
slightly amended form at the end of the 2-1/2 week session in
the Great Hall of the People.
    She said there had been similar changes one year ago, when
the Congress added words about the importance of ideological
education and the need to help poorer provinces left behind in
China's uneven march to greater prosperity.

signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here.
    Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's
external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the
accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the
second half of this year.
    In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner,
with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and
exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs.
    De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint
ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's
trade deficit with the EC.
    The EC's affairs in China are currently looked after by
whichever country holds the group's six-monthly rotating
presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over
in July.

<TITLE>TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid
rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,
political analysts said.
    Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic
summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), they said.
    "The close relationship between Nakasone and President
Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"
Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
told Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages
Nakasone."
    Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was
encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.
    "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
Nakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself is
not so strongly established today."
    Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public
than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support
eroded, the analysts said.
    The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on
Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade
pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the
analysts said.
    "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
Nakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director of
the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.
    This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's
credibility, Shiratori told Reuters.
    The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's
rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.
    "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to
resign early," Shiratori said.
    But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers
before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,
some analysts said.
    However, "unless the Japanese political system can move more
quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very
hostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
William Sterling.
    "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the
final nail in his coffin," he said.
    Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing
Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue
against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts
said.
    But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled
with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
differences and aid Nakasone, they said.
    "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said.

<TITLE>NAKASONE SAYS JAPAN PLANS DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures
immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget.
    He told a Lower House budget committee the government is
likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a
new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government
agencies and ministries for 1988/89.
    The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five
years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of
stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The passage of the budget is expected in late May.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session
Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet
domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth.
    Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to
stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time.
    Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal Democratic
Party to prepare its own economic package in time for his
one-week visit to Washington starting on April 29.

<TITLE>CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON>
unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
985 mln Australian dlrs.
    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
statement.
    The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
    Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
production in Australia, they said.
    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
Cooper-Eromanga area.
    "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
Strait production now under way," McGill said.
    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
against 18 in 1985/86.

<TITLE>CHINA RURAL INDUSTRY FACES PROBLEMS IN ADVANCING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONGSHAN, China, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Workers in China's rural
factories are struggling against a variety of problems to
maintain the momentum of progress since industrialisation of
the countryside began in the 1970s.
    "When I was a child, we had no bicycles. We went everywhere
on foot. The land here is salty, so the harvests were not good.
Money and food were inadequate. When it rained, the water
leaked through the grass roof," said Li Wenxian, 31, of Hongshan
in Zhejiang. Now he and other villagers live in large
two-storey concrete homes with balconies and courtyards.
    But still they face formidable difficulties. Many rural
factories are unable to get the raw materials they need, or
else they find they have become too expensive.
    Gao Jianming, an official of Zhejiang's Rural Industry
department, said Zhejiang firms scour China for raw materials,
which sometimes they barter for finished goods.
    The People's Daily this month reported about 60 pct of
China's rural factories operate below capacity because of power
shortages. It said many rural factories lose money because of
these problems and difficulties in getting credit, poor quality
of goods and competition from larger state firms.
    "Electricity is short. In the busiest periods on the farms
the factories work three to four days a week so that
agriculture can have all the power it needs. But more power is
available at night or on Sundays," Gao said.
    Rural factories mostly operate outside official plans,
which allocate raw materials under quota at cheap prices to
state firms. They have to compete on the open market for raw
materials whose prices are driven up by demand.
    Li said Hongshan does not suffer from power shortages only
because its cement factory provides cheap cement to the
electricity supply department.
    The raw materials of Hongshan's cement have to come
hundreds of miles from central China by rail or canal, while
its textile factories buy fabric from the far northeast.
    The industrialisation of rural China began in the late
1970s, a key part of top leader Deng Xiaoping's economic
reforms. Deng wanted to harness the manpower of the
countryside, but keep it there and not draw it to the cities.
    Hongshan set up factories and businesses because there was
not enough work on the land for its 3,700 people. Now just 120
of its workers work full-time on the land. The rest work in 23
factories making cement, plastics and textiles.
    The transformation of the rural economy is most noticeable
along the eastern seaboard where communications are good,
labour plentiful, land fertile and large markets nearby.
    Gao said rural factories in Zhejiang now employ 25 pct of
the province's labour force. In 1985 such factories, for the
first time, produced more in value than the province's farms.
    "The industrialising process is not over. When our farms are
more mechanised, and not many are now, more labour will become
available. There is a very big potential," Gao said.
    Rural industry in Zhejiang has grown by more than 20 pct a
year since 1980, faster than any other sector of the economy.
    Goods from Hongshan's factories are sold all over China.
    Villager Li said when Hongshan started building factories
in 1975 it was illegal, but local leaders approved it on
condition no state money was invested.
    "We borrowed money to start our cement factory and have
relied on our own resources since then," he said.
    Another worker in a Hongshan tea-growing collective said
before rural industrialisation there was no point in working
hard, because most people earned the same.
    "The laziest in the commune used to laugh at those of us who
worked more, but got the same," she said.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO PAY FIVE PCT LESS FOR INDIAN IRON ORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan will pay five pct less for the
Indian iron ore it imports in fiscal 1987/88 starting April 1
than the average 18 dlrs a tonne it paid in 1986/87, a
government trade official told Reuters.
    He said India had agreed to export to Japan about 23 mln
tonnes of iron ore in 1987/88, about the same as in the current
year.
    The official described the agreement as satisfactory
overall. He said it was signed by an official Indian trade
delegation and Japanese businessmen in Tokyo last week.
    The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreed
not to reduce ore imports from India although Japan's total
iron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because of
the recession in the Japanese steel industry.
    He said Japanese ore imports in calendar 1987 would total
96 mln tonnes, compared with 103.5 mln in 1986.
    Government officials said India's total ore exports are
likely to rise to between 33 and 34 mln tonnes in 1987/88,
against a provisionally estimated 31 mln in 1986/87.

    The ministers said the government will continue to
guarantee existing liabilities and will extend its guarantee to
new liabilities assumed before June 30, 1988.
    Congreve said the POB will operate as a retail bank and
most of its lending will be for housing.

<TITLE>COMMERZBANK INCREASES DIVIDEND, PARENT NET PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> said a
dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary
shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.
    It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to
288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.
    A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however,
preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory
board which meets today.
    The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit
last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.
    With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying
domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of
14.06 marks per share.
    Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from
142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend
and in equity capital, it added.
    From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in
published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.
    The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.
    The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation
certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would
receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable
profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal
value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct.
    The management board of the bank would also propose two
capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react

    It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln
marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue
of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992.

<TITLE>INDIA REDUCES EXPORT DUTY ON COFFEE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>India cut the export duty on coffee
to 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, a
Coffee Board official said.
    The reduction should help India reach its coffee export
target of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31,
against provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in
1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said.
    India is likely to press for international export quotas at
a meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of
depressed prices, he added.
    The International Coffee Organisation, which represents
both consumers and producers, has so far failed to reach
agreement on quotas.
    India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because
the slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, he
said.
    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market
prices surged after a drought devastated Brazil's coffee crop.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES CONFIRMS PREPAYMENTS ON NEW DEBT PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has
confirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments of
principal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debt
restructuring package.
    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers as
saying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.
    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepayment
aspect of the restructuring.
    "They are public documents and there is nothing secret about
it," he told Reuters.
    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretched
repayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with a
seven and a half year grace period and an interest rate margin
of 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.
    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of "seven different
scenarios" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.
    "It was one of the many options we offered the banks in
order to win an attractive pricing," he said.
    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signed
in 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principal
repayments were not due until 1990.
    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect the
Philippines' balance of payments position.
    "There is no problem in financing it -- the prepayments
constitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of
2.5 billion dlrs," he said.
    "We do plan to cover the costs by selling Philippine
Investment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year."
    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominated
instruments that will be offered to creditor banks and are
designed for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved
equity investments within the Philippines.
    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs a
year when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.
    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of the
accord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expected
documentation and agreement from all of them by July.
    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largest
interest rate cut among major debtor nations.
    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a
1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila's
new pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentage
points.
    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point drop
from the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, the
bankers said.
    "Add to this the fact that Manila has frozen principal
repayents since 1983, while Venezuela has amortised six billion
dlrs in foreign debt since 1984 and will have paid back more
than eight billion dlrs by the end of this year," one added.
    Ongpin said Manila's 7/8 margin meant the Philippines would
pay about 100 mln dlrs a year in interest when its grace period
ended.

<TITLE>JAPANESE HESITATE TO INVEST IN WEST GERMAN STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese investors are reluctant to buy
West German stocks, now considered one of the most attractive
buys around after having taken a beating for the past two
years, investment managers said.
    Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world's
largest in capitalisation, wealthy Japanese institutions view
it as too small. They also worry about venturing into a market
from which British investors have recently bailed out, they
said.
    "There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount of
buying Japanese want to do," one West German investment manager
said. There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable to
liquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a sudden
downturn, he added.
    "Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is also
limited," another investment manager said. "They know the blue
chips, but there are too many other names they don't know."
    The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has also
deterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad,
investment managers said.
    Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buy
into unsure overseas markets while the market at home continues
to advance, said Seiji Yamamoto, senior manager at Dresdner ABD
Securities Ltd's Tokyo branch.
    If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possible
from the Tokyo market, they could face difficulty explaining
their funds' performance, he added.
    The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since the
beginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investors
to turn away, one investment manager said.
    The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slow
corporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollar
and a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just before
the London market's liberalisation last year, the investment
manager said. "Right now Japanese investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remains
unfavourable," he said.
    Although there has been some nibbling of West German
stocks, particularly last week, most of the buys were for
short-term trades rather than long-term investments, an
investment advisor at a West German firm said.
    Investment managers believe, however, that genuine interest
in West German stocks could develop within the next three to
six months.
    Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and the
London markets over the Frankfurt market but they are
interested in diversifying some of their funds, they said.
    Some managers have been travelling in Europe, looking for
new opportunities, and are unlikely to ignore West German
stocks, especially with the average price/earnings ratio at
about 11, they said.
    The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the U.S. And
London markets and 52 for the Japanese market, Guenter
Kirchhain, first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said.
    "This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormous
alignment potential," he said. The West German market could
reasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16,
he added.
    Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as many
institutions begin their new business years in April, he said.
    However, one fund manager does not agree that new
investment in West Germany will come that soon.
    "Japanese do not buy into a market with declining
fundamentals," he said. When West Germany's fundamental economic
indicators appear to have bottomed out, that will be the
turning point for their investments, he added.
    Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see the
investment trends set by U.S. And British investors in the West
German market.
    "They are waiting for someone to make the first move," he
said.

its parent company sales estimate of 2,900 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, helped by high general-use ultra-large
computer sales and despite the higher-than-expected yen.
    Current profits are unlikely to reach the estimated 90
billion yen as the currency's rise has reduced the value of
foreign bond holdings, but the company will retain a nine yen
dividend for 1986/87, a spokesman said.
    Current profits in the year to end-March 1986 fell 38.2 pct
from a year before to 158.04 billion yen on sales of 3,003
billion, down 0.8 pct, mainly due to the yen's appreciation.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyds Bank Plc &lt;LLOY.LON> and the
Royal Bank of Canada &lt;RY.TOR> are winding down the primary side
of their capital markets activities in Hong Kong, the chief
executives of the two banks said.
    "We are withdrawing from the primary market in Asia," said
Barry Maddams, Lloyds' general manager here. "It is basically
unprofitable."
    The bank's treasury and capital markets activites,
previously conducted separately at the commercial bank branch
and its merchant banking arm Lloyds Asia Ltd, are now being
consolidated within the commercial bank, he said.
    Maddams said the bank has not decided whether it will
surrender Lloyds Asia's registration as a deposit taking
company (DTC), but it will keep another DTC registration for
LBI Finance (HK) Ltd as a booking vehicle. He did not say how
many jobs will be affected.
    Royal Canada has surrendered the licence of its DTC unit
Orion Royal Pacific Ltd, though it still has some assets and
uses the name, said Vincent Fan, bank chief executive here.
    He said 16 jobs will be lost due to the phase-out of
merchant banking, while syndication and other banking
activities will be continued by the commercial bank.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Public Relations consultancy &lt;Shandwick
Plc> said it had agreed to buy the Los Angeles-based &lt;Rogers
and Cowan Inc> which specialises in the entertainment industry.
    A total of 2.25 mln dlrs is payable on completion, 1.5 mln
will be injected into the business through an interest free
loan and the expenses of the acquisition amount to 660,000 stg.
    Shandwick said it would raise 5.1 mln stg through the
placing of 1.16 mln shares to finance the deal, with the
balance of 2.04 mln stg used to strengthen the balance sheet
and in anticipation of future performance-related payments.
    In the year to end-September Rogers' operating income was
more than 10 mln dlrs. After the acquisition Shandwick's U.S.
Operating income will be comparable to that it earns in the
U.K.
    Rogers' estimated that pretax profit in the year to
end-1987 would exceed 900,000 dlrs. An extraordinary loss of
504,000 dlrs in 1986 resulted from the write off of assets.
    Net tangible assets at end-September were 363,000 dlrs.
    Shandwick shares were unchanged at 460p.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a
total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,700 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24.
    The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a
31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings
from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be
redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end
today, the traders said.
    The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about
3,200 billion yen.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.H>
announced a bonus issue of one new "B" share of 2.5 H.K. Cents
each for every two existing ordinary shares of 25 cents a share
par value.
    A company statement said Hutchison forecast 1987 dividends
for existing shares of not less than 32.5 cents a share and not
less than 3.25 cents for each "B" share.
    Hutchison said the new issue will help increase flexibility

    "The move will provide long term stability to ensure
continuity of overall control of the Hutchison group in that it
provides Hutchison with a stable framework within which
management, development and the planned growth of the group's
businesses can take place," it added.
    Hutchison shares lost one dlr to end at 53 dlrs each today.

<TITLE> EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Ress, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and
electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they
generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest
trade row between the United States and Japan.
    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,
as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade
practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.
    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit
with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese
trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.
    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting
with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.
    "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the
U.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy
Research Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are pretty
much the same."
    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or
that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of
the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,
Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.
    "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," he
added. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of
free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that
liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."
    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's
tendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an import
tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.
    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to
be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.
    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has
threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic
goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has
failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.
    But the European Community has challenged the agreement as
a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.
    "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of
the United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf.
    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough
line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest
of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take
the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told
Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position
since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a
strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.
    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign
ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and
appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after
the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.
    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no
signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging
sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a
trade war, they said.
    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in
European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,
cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to
try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.
    In Britain, where the government is angered over the
difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has
faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said
last week that retaliatory action is being considered.
    But government officials said last night, "We are not
talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."
    They said the government would consider its options at a
cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions
were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the
Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial
markets, government officials said.

<TITLE>CABLE SHARES FIRM ON JAPAN SPECULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc
&lt;CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that
its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in
Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said.
    The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT
compared with 364p last night.
    The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in
Japan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the
Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based
telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable's
stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.
    However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute
over the shareholdings had been resolved.
    British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament
last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participation
in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese
telecommunications market really was.
    A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the
speculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued no
statement today on the issue.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN MULLS OTHER OPTIONS TO STOP YEN RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's liberalised financial markets are
making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities
to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have
several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan
sources said.
    A senior central bank official said that such methods as
controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap
agreements with other central banks, which have not been
invoked since 1978, are all being considered.
    "But the time may not be ripe," he said.
    "In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost
impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"
said another senior bank official.
    But the first official said: "From a technical viewpoint,
the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately
after other central banks involved agreed to do so."
    A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two
nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the
other's currency in case of need.
    "If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce
the decision jointly," said the first official.
    The sources said they believed the limit of currency market
intervention may be being reached after they saw recent
concerted market action by central banks of major industrial
nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the
battered dollar.
    But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further
easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an
official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they
said.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled
out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.
    One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of
the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the
U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue
intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run
out of their yen cash positions.
    "But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,"
he said.
    The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with
the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200
billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,
according to the sources.
    Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two
billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the
dollar in New York last week.
    The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other
currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find
it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each
other towards that end.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CHINA REFORMS TO TAKE DECADES, NO ALTERNATIVE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's economic reforms will take
decades to fulfill and will outlast the life of any leader
because they are the only way to save the country from poverty,
an economist in one of the country's top think tanks told
Reuters.
    But He Weiling, Washington representative of the China
Economic System Reform Institute, said China's economic reforms
definitely are not at risk from the nationwide drive since
January against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western
political ideas.
    He said "bourgeois liberalism" is not affecting departments
dealing with economics.
    His is one of a small number of key institutes, set up in
the early 1980s, which formulate economic reform policies and
advise the top leadership on them.
    Discussing subjects raised in the budget speech last week,
which put the 1986 and 1987 deficits at more than 15 billion
yuan because of excessive consumer demand and capital
construction plus falling efficiency in state firms, He said
reform of state firms and the financial system is the key goal
for 1987.
    "The most difficult thing is to strike the balance between
making them independent units and the need for central control,"
He said.
    "We are exploring ways of doing this, through joint stock
ownership, leasing, factory management responsibility systems
or in other ways," he added.
    One of the most serious problems facing China's leaders is
how to curb excess investment in capital construction,
especially in projects outside the state plan.
    He said this problem is chronic in all socialist economies.
    This is because firms are judged on output, not
profitability or efficiency.
    "Firms use every excuse to get money and materials. They say
they want money to build offices but in fact use it to build
apartments, which is unauthorised," He said.
    "Also, it is not good to report profits, which would mean
higher tax payments. It is better to report a loss," he added.
    He said China's state firms are continuing a 5,000-year-old
tradition when they under-report their assets in order to
reduce claims on them by higher authority.
    He said China will have to improve auditing, economic
regulations and the tax system, which he described as "chaotic,"
especially at the lower levels, in order to deal with
under-reporting.
    "Another important step is to further develop the money
markets to give firms an opportunity to invest. They need
channels for this which they do not have now. Without this,
there will be no genuine supply and demand for money," he said.
    As a reform to encourage efficiency, China now supplies
state firms with loans instead of grants as in the past.
    But He said the reforms have not resulted in much real
change because the loans carry low-interest. "So some efficient
firms have not been able to get money from banks."
    Price reform has been one of the most sensitive aspects of
the reform programme. Widespread discontent over price rises
forced the government to promise in January that there will be
no major increases in 1987.
    He said the price of steel, timber and cement and other
industrial raw materials only will "rise gradually" this year.
    Large-scale price adjustments would have an adverse
psychological impact and create social discontent.
    "We must preserve unity and popular support," he said, but
"sometimes, the common people must make a sacrifice, like those
of Germany and Japan after 1945."
    He said restrictions on a wide range of prices, including
most farm and light industrial products, have been lifted and
many intermediate pricing schemes scrapped over the last eight
years.
    "It will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete an
overhaul of the price system. We must move carefully. We have
no model to work from and have only ourselves to rely on," He
said.
    He said the greatest fear expressed by foreigners is that
reform and open-door policies will not survive the death of
certain elderly leaders.
    He did not name top leader Deng Xiaoping, 82, the chief
architect of both policies since 1979.
    "These fears are unfounded. The two policies have already
become the basic national policy of China. The reforms are
irreversible. China is one of the poorest 25 countries in the
world. Without the reforms, how are we to escape from this
poverty?"

<TITLE>S. KOREA MINISTER TO VISIT U.S. FOR CURRENCY TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's Finance Minister Chung
In-yong will visit U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker next
week to discuss U.S. Requests for an appreciation of South
Korea's won against the dollar, finance ministry officials
said.
    They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to
attend the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Interim
Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of
reducing Seoul's trade surplus with Washington.
    The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set.
    The IMF committee meeting, scheduled for April 9, is
expected to review the resolution reached by the six top
industrialised nations in Paris last month calling for newly
industrialised countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to
allow their currencies to rise.
    The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul's
efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the
need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next
few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5
billion dlrs.
    South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won,
but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly.
    Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce earlier this month a sudden won revaluation could
result in South Korea running a large trade deficit and being
forced to renege on its international debt repayments.
    The Bank of Korea, the central bank, today fixed the won at
a two-year high of 846.90. The won has gained 5.1 pct since the
beginning of 1986.
    South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.1
billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion in 1985.

    The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after

    Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points,

the Bundesbank did intervene.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move in
selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    "It sounds like a good deal," Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode
and Co> told Reuters.
    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead
sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and
Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.
    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
    "This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,"
McKibbin said.
    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given
itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right
to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an
oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers
yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs
for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd>
said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry
was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
    "The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
back to the Americans," Goldston-Morris said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the
largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
and mills in the country, analysts said.
    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the
bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging
investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
overall performance, analysts said.
    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
    "It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
price collapsed on them," Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares
and Philips Ltd> said.
    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also
gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake
in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
&lt;BRKN.S>.
    "Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,"
Goldston-Morris said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN BANKERS PREDICT MAJOR FINANCIAL REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan is planning to significantly
relax foreign exchange controls within the next few months, but
there is little prospect of a sudden outflow of capital,
bankers and economists polled by Reuters said.
    They said a statement by Premier Yu Kuo-Hua last Friday
that Taiwan might suspend the controls indicated the government
was ready to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals to hold and
invest foreign currency for the first time.
    "There has been a major shift in government policy," said
Liang Kuo-Shu, chairman of the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.
    Yu said foreign exchange controls, under which all foreign
currency must be converted into Taiwan dollars, might be
suspended if Taiwan's trade surplus grows too large. He said
controls could be retained for use in an emergency.
    Yu said the aim was to reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves and ease pressure on the money supply.
    The reserves have grown to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs,
compared with about 26 billion in late March last year, due to
Taiwan's widening trade surplus. The surplus hit a record 15.6
billion dlrs last year against 10.6 billion in 1985.
    Approximately 95 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.
    The surplus in the first two months of this year rose to
2.73 billion dlrs from 2.02 billion in the same 1986 period.
    Money supply grew by a seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in the
year to end-february.
    Bankers and economists said they did not believe the
government intended to drop all foreign exchange controls and
allow the Taiwan dollar to be freely traded.
    But they said over the next few months certain restrictions
will probably be eased to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals
to hold part of their foreign exchange earnings for overseas
investment.
    Bankers and economists also said it was likely the
government would lift a ban on investment in foreign stocks.
They said it was uncertain, however, whether investment would
be direct or channeled through government-approved funds.
    Taiwan allowed firms and individuals to invest in overseas
government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit
for the first time last year.
    Bankers said Yu's statment was an indication the government
is becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of
inflation posed by the growing foreign exchange reserves.
    Inflation is now running at about three pct.
    Mounting reserves are also seen as giving Washington
leverage in its efforts to force Taiwan to boost the value of
its currency to reduce the trade imbalance.
    Bankers said dropping foreign exchange restrictions was
unlikely to lead to significant capital outflows because of the
rising value of the Taiwan dollar.
    "All the signs are that capital would move in," said John
Brinsden, manager of Standard Chartered Bank in Taipei.
    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 16 pct against the
U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened today at 34.26
against the American currency.
    Most economists believe the Taiwan dollar will continue to
rise this year on strong U.S. Pressure for appreciation.
    Economists estimate up to five billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money flowed into Taiwan last year.
    Yu's statement surprised most local and foreign bankers,
who regard the former central bank governor as a fiscal
arch-conservative. They said it shows Taiwan is determined to
go ahead with wide-ranging financial liberalisation.
    "It's more than a straw in the wind," said Brinsden. "It
indicates that something dramatic will happen."

<TITLE>BROKERS SAY TOKYO STOCKS WILL RESUME RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Kynge, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tokyo stock market is likely to
recover from its recent nervousness, caused by the rise of the
yen and the threat of a trade war with the U.S., And resume its
upward climb, brokers polled by Reuters said.
    President Reagan's threat to impose tariffs on Japanese
electronics exports because of Japan's alleged refusal to abide
by a bilateral agreement on computer chips, was unlikely to
cause the market to crash, the brokers said on the eve of the
new fiscal year starting April 1.
    The market today fell 60.91 points to 21,566.66.
    Most brokers said Tokyo stocks should rise 10 to 15 pct in
the coming fiscal year, provided the yen does not rise too far
against the dollar and U.S. Sanctions do not escalate into an
all-out trade war.
    "The market will continue to rise in the new fiscal year, so
long as we can avoid a free-fall in the dollar against the yen,"
Nikko Securities' top analyst Kasuhiza Okamoto said.
    However, brokers said the market was unlikely to perform
better than it has in the past year.
    "It will be very difficult to repeat last year's
performance. Last year was a bumper year that will live in the
annals of the market," said Kleinwort and Benson Ltd's
securities analyst, Peter Tasker.
    The market rose 37 pct in the fiscal year just ending.
    Tasker said Japan's discount rate, which was cut five times
this past fiscal year, was so low that it forced funds from
bank accounts into stocks, buoying the market.
    Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the coming
year the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twice
and the inflow of funds would be slower.
    Brokers said their optimism about the market was based on
the current low interest rates, the increasing propensity of
the Japanese to save as the economy stagnates, the imminent
introduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post office
savings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks.
    They said Japanese with money to spare, and companies
unwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the present
climate of stagnant growth, would keep on snapping up stocks.
    "You just have to jump on the back of the winners and jump
off quick if they start to lose," one broker said.
    Currently the Japanese discount rate is 2.5 pct.
    Brokers predicted that among this year's winners would be
shares which will benefit from domestic expansion.
    Other winners would be stocks related to the fight against
AIDS, financial stocks in general, food shares likely to gain
from a government-initiated agricultural deregulation
programme, and issues supported by Japan's increased defense
spending budget.
    "The themes this year are very clear," said Nikko Securities'
Okamoto. He said Japan had to respond to international pressure
to stimulate its domestic demand, buy more imports and
establish itself as a supply base of capital.
    Brokers said banks and other financial institutions would
be among the most popular shares this year.
    "We will have to consolidate our position as the capital
supply base to the world," said Okamoto, noting Japan is the
world's largest creditor nation.
    Brokers said they expect the government this year to permit
Japanese banks to start full-scale equity brokerage overseas.
They also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan.
    Brokers said they expect subsidies to Japan's farmers to be
slashed this year, cutting the price of food. Beneficiaries of
such a move would include food processors and suppliers.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has set the expansion of
domestic demand as a top priority this year, and brokers said
they envisaged higher profits for real estate and construction
companies, as well as many domestic manufacturers.
    Brokers denied a suggestion that the market might be
over-extended because the amount now invested, 334,000 billion
yen, was about the same as Japan's gross national product.
    Barclays De Zoette and Wedd financial analyst, Peter
Morgan, said the 20 pct tax on post office and bank deposits
due to be levied this autumn would channel at least 2,000
billion more yen into the stock market.
    Brokers said they believe there would be more reports in
the coming year of scientific discoveries to combat or diagnose
Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and these would
propel related companies' shares even higher than they had
risen already.
    "AIDS stories suck individuals' money into the market.
Japanese people are paranoid about AIDS," said one broker.

<TITLE>INDIA EXPORTS ITS FIRST PASSENGER CARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>India today signed an agreement to
sell 500 mini passenger cars to Hungary, its first export
contract for cars, an industry ministry spokesman told Reuters.
    Under the agreement signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) -
an Indo-Japanese car maker - and Hungary's state-owned Mogurt
trading company - the cars, valued about two mln dlrs, will be
delivered in 1987, he said.
    "We expect Hungary will buy up to 5,000 Maruti cars per year
from next year if the first batch proves popular in that
country," he said without elaborating.
    The launching of 800 cc Maruti cars in 1983 revolutionised
the country's dormant automobile industry, which until then had
marketed models which were at least 30 years old.
    The Indian government owns 74 pct stake in MUL, and the
balance of 26 pct is held by Suzuki Motor Co Ltd of Japan.
    The Japanese-style Maruti, costing about 81,000 rupees, is
the cheapest car on the Indian market and has proved a popular
model, with order books full for the next three years, industry
sources said.
    MUL and India's three private companies have a combined
production capacity of 206,000 passenger cars a year.

<TITLE>THATCHER SAYS TRADE TARGETS SET WITH MOSCOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for
increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier
today.
    She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain
and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and
increased understanding."
    Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British
businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would
work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in
bilateral trade by 1990.
    This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400
mln stg over their present export levels.
    "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export
opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the
meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British-
Soviet Chamber of Commerce.
    After her talks with Ryzhkov, Thatcher and the Soviet
Premier were joined for the signing of agreements covering new
scientific and cultural exchanges by Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, who had nine hours of talks with her yesterday.

    The French company, &lt;Ricoh Industry France SA>, in
Wettolsheim, Haut-Rhin, Alsace, will produce PPCs at an initial
monthly rate of about 2,000, rising to between 4,000 and 5,000
units in a couple of years, with initial investment of one
billion yen, Ricoh said.
    The new company will create 100 jobs.
    The company said its wholly-owned U.K. Subsidiary &lt;Ricoh
U.K. Products Ltd> in Telford, which has produced office
automation equipment such as PPCs, sorters and facsimiles since
April 1985, will invest 1.7 billion yen to build a new PPC
plant. It is due to start operation in September 1987 and
increase output to 7,000 per month from the present 2,500.
    The new U.K. Plant will create 100 jobs to give a total of
360 jobs at the U.K. Subsidiary.
    After both new plants reach full production, 70 pct of
Ricoh's total PPC to be sold in Europe will be supplied by
those European units.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consuming countries, chastened by the
collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support
operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that
commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are
serving, a Reuter survey showed.
    They want price ranges to be more responsive to market
trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the
accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid
the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.
Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,
have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.
    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a
generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and
prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey
showed.
    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set
precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do
under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase
limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets
and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of
total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This
will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the
world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.
    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer
Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.
    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was
adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting
countries agreed several changes to make the reference price
more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions
under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance
operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund
buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature
of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running
into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.
    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations
in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that
agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.
    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that
"objective criteria" should be used to define export quota
shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of
Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain
its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,
although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,
delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term
negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.
    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These
do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for
discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect
statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said
differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any
progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer
competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut
militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.
    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are
international study groups, made up of governments with advice
from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.
    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned
directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to
become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet
Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the
U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,
citing the lack of widespread support.
    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in
Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity
pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to
study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented
commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.
    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the
price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"
official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently
belongs to only two international commodity agreements that
have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement
(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat
pacts.
    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement
because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and
not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,
the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA
as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.
    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members
of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment
mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect
market trends and also to continue the accord as a market
oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.
    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have
consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on
the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister
Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the
world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its
participation in international commodity pacts case by case.
    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC
launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes
for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from
70,000.
    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and
delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told
Reuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses to
stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were
close to market reality, if there was full participation by
producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to
take their obligations in the framework of the agreement
seriously."
    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for a
country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German
approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best
instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant
to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how
developing countries often interpret them."
    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of
commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third
World producing countries. But recently demands for more
stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the
need for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" have
grown.
    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be
a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.
    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct
market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree
of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended
borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.
Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to
reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather
than dictate what prices should be.
    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price
realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.
    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable
to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of
sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real
market situation, particularly regarding stocks.
    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told
Reuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as the
problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are
structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity
agreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External Trade
Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers
cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity
agreements.
    "The political will is not there on the part of some
consumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.
    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian
Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an
agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market
reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system
of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact
and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham
Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings
enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean
greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading domestic semiconductor makers
will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips
from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.
    The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the
sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the
plans, analysts said.
    The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to
honour a semiconductor trade pact.
    In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan
said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.
    But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop
the tariffs if Japan shows a "clear indication" that it will open
its markets to U.S. Goods.
    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has
urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more
than 20 pct the previous quarter.
    MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.
    Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.
    "The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword
and shown that it can and will do business," said analyst Nick
Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.
    But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
cut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of
the sanctions -- is more difficult.
    "The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's
(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer
products. They're well supplied here," said Richard May, senior
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.
    The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,
but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end
production skills, the analysts said.
    "The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
semiconductors in return for free access to other areas," said
Edwards.
    A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm's
reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the
trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of
the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.
    Company officials unveiled the following plans -
    - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to
slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to
six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last
quarter.
     In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip
imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
consumption the year before.
    - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will
fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The
company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
target. Imports are currently very low.
    - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM
production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is
considering ways to boost imports, a company official said.
    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell
the U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a
joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern
Japan.
    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second
quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln
chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased
imports but an official said "boosting imports will be difficult
as it depends on sales demand."
    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with
MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.
    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April
production by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways
to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five
billion yen, a company official said.

<TITLE>CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling
its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead
sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production
Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.
    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.
    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given
itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an
ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions
of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the
largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in
the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the
bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.

<TITLE>LASMO SET TO BENEFIT FROM FUTURE OIL PRICE RISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc
(Lasmo) &lt;LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise
again and it is confident this will happen early in the next
decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.
    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and
gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil
equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year
since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.
    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,
down from 118 mln in 1985.
    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.
    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in
oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,
which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln
stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for
lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.
    The company said had very few exploration wells committed
for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its
exploration program. Even without further success, the existing
fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to
profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.
    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.

<TITLE>CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>One or two large West German banks
effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at
the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from
their overnight deposits, money dealers said.
    As a result, call money soared in active trading to around
the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as
banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.
    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily
51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the
central bank over the first 29 days of the month.
    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7
billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.
    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise
holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and
tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because
banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of
Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for
three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.
    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,
flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return
until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.
    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,
commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five
billion marks or so.
    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the
month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,
draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought
funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess
funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.
    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced
knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its
sales of treasury bills on Friday.
    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total
minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank
has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate
the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.
    "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not
selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this
amount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the
market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will
be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."
    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in
rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.
    International central banks have been at pains to prevent a
dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.
Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer
undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.
    "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between
three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today
cannot be very popular," the senior dealer said.
    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average
rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or
four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned
without the excessive draining through the treasury bill
mechanism.
    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations
between Germany's major employers and the unions, the
Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to
monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.
    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the
Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion
marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

order from Jydisk Telfon Aktieselskab (JTAG), Denmark's second
largest telephone company, for its EWSD digital dialing system.
    A Siemens statement gave no financial details. But it said
the JTAG order, together with an order received in 1985 from
the largest Danish telephone firm, Kjobenhavn Telefon
Aktieselskab (KTAS), brought Siemens' order volume in Denmark
to around 100 mln marks over the next 10 years.
    The JTAG order is for at least 125,000 telephone
connections with an option to double this amount later.
    Siemens said the order meant that it, like Sweden's L.M.
Ericsson &lt;ERIC.ST>, now supply both of Denmark's largest
telephone companies.
    Together Siemens and Ericsson have 90 pct of the Danish
long-distance dialing system market, it added.

<TITLE>CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON>
unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
985 mln Australian dlrs.
    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
statement.
    The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
    Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>CSR BIDS 2.20 DLRS A SHARE FOR PIONEER SUGAR MILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it will offer 2.20
dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
&lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
    CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
Sugar stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
    The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier
reported statement that it will sell its &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty
Ltd> unit to an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Fletcher Challenge Ltd> (FCL)
Managing Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that
&lt;Rada Corp Ltd> had decided to sell its shares in &lt;N.Z. Forest
Products Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's &lt;Amcor Ltd>.
    He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the
24 pct of NZFP held by Rada. He said the FCL offer was better
than Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP
shareholders, but he gave no further details.
    Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their
pulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were
increasing their existing cross-shareholdings.
    The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in
Amcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada's
NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek
statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.
    Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from &lt;Wattie
Industries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the price
to be paid by Amcor.
    FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last
year with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share,
valuing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at
3.88 dlrs today.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES CONFIRMS PREPAYMENTS ON NEW DEBT PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has
confirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments of
principal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debt
restructuring package.
    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers as
saying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.
    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepayment
aspect of the restructuring.
    "They are public documents and there is nothing secret about
it," he told Reuters.
    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretched
repayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with a
seven and a half year grace period and an interest rate margin
of 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.
    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of "seven different
scenarios" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.
    "It was one of the many options we offered the banks in
order to win an attractive pricing," he said.
    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signed
in 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principal
repayments were not due until 1990.
    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect the
Philippines' balance of payments position.
    "There is no problem in financing it -- the prepayments
constitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of
2.5 billion dlrs," he said.
    "We do plan to cover the costs by selling Philippine
Investment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year."
    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominated
instruments that will be offered to creditor banks and are
designed for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved
equity investments within the Philippines.
    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs a
year when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.
    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of the
accord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expected
documentation and agreement from all of them by July.
    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largest
interest rate cut among major debtor nations.
    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a
1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila's
new pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentage
points.
    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point drop
from the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, the
bankers said.
    "Add to this the fact that Manila has frozen principal
repayents since 1983, while Venezuela has amortised six billion
dlrs in foreign debt since 1984 and will have paid back more
than eight billion dlrs by the end of this year," one added.
    Ongpin said Manila's 7/8 margin meant the Philippines would
pay about 100 mln dlrs a year in interest when its grace period
ended.

<TITLE>MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a
difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
nations.
    Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
Dieter said.
    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
last year, were now having an effect.
    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."
    He said the company's drive to combine activities in
mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus
point" for Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
and lack of demand for steel pipe.
    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe
were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this
year.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a
total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,700 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24.
    The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a
31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings
from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be
redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end
today, the traders said.
    The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about
3,200 billion yen.

<TITLE>NAKASONE SAYS JAPAN PLANS DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures
immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget.
    He told a Lower House budget committee the government is
likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a
new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government
agencies and ministries for 1988/89.
    The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five
years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of
stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The passage of the budget is expected in late May.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session
Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet
domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth.
    Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to
stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time.
    Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal Democratic
Party to prepare its own economic package in time for his
one-week visit to Washington starting on April 29.

<TITLE>SWISSAIR TO BUY PRATT AND WHITNEY ENGINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> said it will buy Pratt
and Whitney PW 4000 engines to power six newly-ordered
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 long haul jets due to enter service
from 1990.
    The engine is a newly developed one which will enter
operation in Summer 1987.
    Swissair announced on March 19 that it was placing a firm
order for six of the planes, with an option for another 12. It
said at the time that it was not sure whether to equip them
with General Electric, Rolls Royce or Pratt and Whitney
engines.
    Pratt and Whitney is a division of United Technologies Corp
&lt;UTX.N>.
    A Swissair spokesman declined to say how much the engine
order was worth. The total order, including six planes, engines
and parts, is worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
    If Swissair decides to exercise its option for the further
12 MD-11s these too would have Pratt and Whitney engines, the
spokesman said.
    He said the fact the airline's Boeing 747s, McDonnell
Douglas DC-9s and Airbuses all have Pratt and Whitney engines
played a major part in the decision.

<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> has found cracks in
the tails of two of its own DC-10 aircraft made by McDonnell
Douglas Corp &lt;MD.N> and a third belonging to the Dutch airline
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>, a Swissair spokesman said.
    A Swissair spokesman said the cracks, in the horizontal
tail surface, came to light during routine maintenance of the
Dutch aircraft here on March 18.
    Subsequent checks on Swissair's 11 DC-10s showed similar
problems, thought to be due to material fatigue, he said.
    The spokesman said the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority
(FAA) and McDonnell Douglas have ordered checks of all 400
DC-10s in use by airlines worldwide.
    Swissair said both the FAA and Swiss aviation authorities
had allowed it to continue to fly its DC-10s on condition the
damage was repaired and planes were checked after each landing.
    Several days ago, Swissair announced a firm order for six
McDonnell Douglas's MD-11s, with an option for 12 more, to
replace its DC-10s. The MD-11 is a development of the DC-10.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;British Caledonian Group>, Britain's
second largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretax
loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with
a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir
Adam Thomson told reporters.
    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist
attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl
disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle
East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.
    He said the poor results were caused by "a range of
exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" and
predicted a return to profitability this year.
    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell
some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the
Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business
.

<DATELINE>     LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil will be producing 2.8 mln
vehicles a year by the end of this century and it could become
the world's third largest national market for motor vehicles,
according to a report by the Economist magazine's Economist
Intelligence Unit.
    The report stated that Brazil already offered a huge
national market for the vehicle producers and offered potential
access to other large Latin American markets. "Development of a
fully integrated motor industry in Brazil may not be far away,"
it said. Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford and Fiat are all
operating modern car plants in Brazil now, it added. 
 "Multinationals will want to consolidate and then expand in
Brazil because of the enormous sourcing opportunities that such
a relatively low cost producer offers," the report said.
    It pointed out, however, that corporate life in Brazil was
complicated by its economic situation. "At present Brazil is
suffering from a debt crisis, rampant inflation and exchange
rate fluctuations," the Intelligence Unit said.
    "In spite of this, Brazil's resilience is maintained by the
potential created by its still under-exploited natural and
human resources. The reward for holding out in the present
economic climate could be huge," it added.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Acquisition Co said it was
disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and
asked how the company might give better value to shareholders.
    Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr
per share tender offer from General Acquisition, an affiliate
of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, and said it was
studying financially superior alternatives.
    The General Acquisition partnership called the response
inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had tried
to discuss the offer with Gencorp.
    The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to
prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison
pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make
takeovers more expensive.
    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to
put off the date its rights will trade separately from the
common stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension was
subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional
on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more
of Gencorp before April 6.
    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be
completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.
    The partnership in its statement again urged Gencorp
management to work with it to facilitate a transaction.

<TITLE>U.S. MAY DROP TARIFFS IF JAPAN OPENS - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on
Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an
agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview.
    "But there has to be a clear indication that they are
willing to act," he said.
    Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are
problems "they have brought on themselves."
    The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.
    "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
turmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we have
gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred
for only a few weeks or months in Japan."
    The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will
affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny
fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.
    Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. We
don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"
Yeutter said.
    Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in
Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
will include "some difficult items on the agenda."
    Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part
semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said.
    Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has
failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has
failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries,
undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

<TITLE>JAPAN WILL ASK COMPANIES TO BOOST IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Minister of International Trade
and Industry, Hajime Tamura, will meet representatives from 151
of the nation's largest companies next week and appeal to them
to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said.
    The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports
and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.
    Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared
to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of
manufactured goods have climbed.
    Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports
and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an
attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company
spokesmen said.
    The officials also said they expect the government's new
trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese
companies to set up production facilities overseas.
    Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese
companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from
everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are
dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan's
trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year.

<TITLE>U.S. LEADING INDEX ROSE 0.7 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. index of leading indicators
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised
0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in
January.
    The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.
    A total of four of nine indicators available for February
contributed to the increase in the index.
    Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders
for consumer goods and materials, average work week and
building permits.
    Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in
sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance,
average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance,
and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
    The main factor in the January revision was contracts and
orders for plant and equipment, the department said.
    December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier
2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of
1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February after
increasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct in
December.
    The department said it has suspended net business formation
from the leading indicators index because it has deteriorated
as a measure of change in the business population.

<DATELINE>    ROCKY HILL, Conn., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ames Department Stores Inc
said its year-end audit has revealed an extraordinary inventory
shortage at its Secaucus, N.J., distribution center and an
investigation is in progress.
    The company said it expects to report earnings for the year
ended January 31 in about two weeks and estimates that net
income will be 27 to 29 mln dlrs, or 72 to 77 cts per share,
down from earnings of 40.4 mln dlrs or 1.19 dlrs per share
earned the previous year.
    Ames said the net income for the year just ended will
reflect a decline in the gross margin percentage, an increase
in the effective tax rate and the effect of the inventory
shortage.
    A company spokesman said most of the decline in earnings
results from the inventory shortage.

<TITLE>ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Executive board members of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue
of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here,
delegates said.
    No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no
further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day
talks, they said.
    Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to
agree export quota shares in early March.
    Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the
largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.
    "The situation is unchanged," consumer spokesman Abraham Van
Overbeeke told reporters. "As long as Brazil sticks to its
position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in
meeting."
    At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its
previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers
and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution
of export shares using "objective criteria," which would likely
have reduced Brazil's share.
    Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota
negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil
was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal
was accepted would no longer be on the table.
    "As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million
bags," he told Reuters.
    Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African
and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by
Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.
    The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a
briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent
Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.
    There, the producers expressed their political will to
negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the
damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to
agree quotas, Montes said.
    The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock
verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take
up the remainder of today's session, delegates said.

compared with only 200,000 tonnes 20 years earlier.
    The daily did not detail 1986 output but said further

its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7
mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved
performance was mainly due to product prices falling more
slowly than crude prices during the year.
    He added that total sales volume increased as a result of
higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market
sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels.
    But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results
are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aluminium capacity expansion planned for
the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any
acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the
scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird
Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review.
    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to
be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln
tonnes are scheduled, Bird said.
    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and
increased imports by less developed countries.
    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate
by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world
consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from
13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird
said.
    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of
change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed
this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied
with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have
served them well in recent years.
    In order to encourage the construction of additional
smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher
level.
    Production costs are likely to rise again in the years
ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity
suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,
according to the review.
    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price
scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and
89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.
    Such a price development is not expected to cause any
marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely
rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the
pipeline for steel and copper.
    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,
as the world economy has not responded well to the
opportunities offered by cheap oil.
    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4
pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher
in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>CHINA GETS RARE CRITICISM AT PEOPLE'S CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charges of public sector waste,
corruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid the
compliments in debates at the annual session of China's
parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).
    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the China
International Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), who
also represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the "profit before
everything" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlement
and extravagant gifts and banquets.
    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.
    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members on
Premier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.
    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provinces
said Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.
One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pct
of total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today.
"This is incompatible with the important place occupied by
agriculture," he said.
    Other deputies said the state had broken promises to
improve fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.
    Although another congress member was quoted by the agency
as saying Zhao's opening speech last week was "discreet,
appropriate, comprehensive and assuring," others said the
government had spent too much or too little. One member said
people were worried about the state's budget deficit, projected
at more than two billion dlrs this year.

<TITLE>LONDON MEAT FUTURES NEED MARKETING - CHAIRMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pigmeat and beef futures, which have
been thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,
despite lower physical prices and the introduction of new
contracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman Pat
Elmer said in his annual report.
    In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cash
settlement contracts, representing a move away from the
problems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initial
deliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said.
    Although the physical industry is aware of the market and
follows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in
market volume, Elmer said.
    "If we are to achieve our true potential the floor members
must give the market much more time and attention," he added.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said
proposals to resolve a dispute over entry to Japan's
telecommunications market were not acceptable.
    A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been
made in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio
Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the
Federation of Economic Organisations.
    However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between
the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable
a five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed
but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he
said.
    The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the
board of the merged company.
    The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept
applications from the two rivals for fair review.
    Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation
that the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain's
government as a test case of how open the Japanese
telecommunications market is -- was near settlement.
    Cable shares at 1350 GMT were quoted at 375p compared with
a close last night at 364p.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the United States and Japan must work to avert a
possible trade war, and he added that a trade war would not be
in the interests of Britain.
    Lawson told journalists that "the prospects for the (U.K.)
economy look very very good - providing we can avoid a trade
war." He stressed that "a heavy responsiblity in different ways
lies on Japan and the United States to ensure that we do avoid
such a trade war."
    Asked whether he believed such a trade war could be
averted, Lawson replied, "I very much hope so."
    Britain last week warned that it would retaliate if Japan
did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave notice that the U.K.
Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent (Cable
and Wireless Plc) (CAWL.L) from taking a significant position
in a new Japanese international telecommunications venture.
    But British officials are now trying to dampen
anti-Japanese rhetoric, to try to keep developments under
control.
    The British Conservative government will on Thursday
consider what legal options are available to it to try to
increase U.K. Access to Japanese markets, officials said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Institute for Economic Research
(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross
domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct
forecast made last December.
    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw
the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as
the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision
due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.
    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil
producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's
fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.
    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this
year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private
consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct
in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.
    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2
pct last year due to the slack economic activity.
    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit
of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion
surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's
central bank, last month forecast the current account would be
roughly in balance this year.
    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have
no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the
budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9
pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FERRUZZI MAY FLOAT UP TO 49 PCT OF PARIS UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RAVENNA, Italy, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is studying a
project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
pct of its French unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> and could
raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln
dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."
    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the
European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc
&lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
gave no details.
    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
CPC business.
    In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer
&lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi
was "apparently still organising finance," his company might
still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630
mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at the
date foreseen in the preliminary contract."
    Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any
indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in
European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's
purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by
September 30.
    Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and
disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's
European business was apparently rejected in favour of
Ferruzzi's lower bid.
    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said "Amylum
should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right
offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case
of the acquisition of CPC's European business."
    Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern
himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under
study, he added.
    Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the
European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC
business, Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minority
partners in the CPC business." He declined to elaborate.

<TITLE>AVA/DIXONS LITIGATION DROPPED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dixons Group Plc &lt;DXNS.L> said that
following an agreement with &lt;Audio/Video Af~filiates Inc>, AVA,
all litigation between the companies has been dismissed.
    AVA filed suit against Dixons, Cyclops Corp, Allegheny Corp
and others in connection with Dixons' recent tender offer for
Cyclops on March 20.
    Dixons also said in today's statement that Cyacq Corp
agreed to end its competing tender offer of 92.50 dlrs per
share for all outstanding Cyclops common stock, which total
some 5.4 mln shares.
    In line with Cyacq's decision, Dixons said it would now pay
an additional 4.75 dlrs per share to each shareholder whose
shares were purchased following its offer for Cyclops at 90.25
dlrs per share.
    It said the additional amount, when added to the original
tender offer, totalled 95 dlrs per share.
    Dixons said on March 27 that it had raised its stake in
Cyclops Corp to about 83 pct, and that it intended to increase
from 90.25 dlrs to 95 dlrs the amount per share paid in the
merger of a Dixons subsidiary with Cyclops.

<DATELINE>    CANOGA PARK, Calif., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp's &lt;GM>
Hughes Aircraft Co subsidiary and Raytheon Co said they formed
a joint-venture partnership to compete for the U.S. Navy's
Advanced Air-to-Air Missile program.
    The two contractors said their teaming is in response to
the Navy's March 20 request for proposals for the
demonstration-validation phase of the program that called for
contractor teaming.
    The Hughes-Raytheon partnership is called H and R Co.
    The Hughes-Raytheon statement said McDonnell Douglas Corp's
&lt;MD> McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co subsidiary will be the
principal subcontractor to the partnership and will be
responsible for the missile airframe design and propulsion.
    Under the partnership, it said, Raytheon and Hughes will
have equal responsibility for defining the overall missile
system design and development.
    Raytheon will have responsibility for the design of the
radar guidance sybsystem and target detection device.
    While Hughes will be responsible for overall guidance and
missile integration, both companies will assume key roles in
the integration of the overall missile with the Navy's many
aircraft and weapons systems, the statement said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the agreement among the industrial countries reached in Paris
last month should foster stability of exchange rates at around
current levels.
    In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee,
Baker outlined many of the measures taken designed to achieve
more balanced growth and a reduction of trade imbalances during
the Paris meeting.
    "These measures should also foster greater stability of
exchange rates around current levels," he said.
    Baker reiterated that the ministers at the Paris meeting
agreed that their currencies were within ranges "broadly
consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and that
further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth
and adjustment prospects."
    He added: "In these circumstances, we agreed to cooperate
closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current
levels."

<TITLE>GAF &lt;GAF> SEEKS ALL OF BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WAYNE, N.J., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAF Corp said it has made an all
cash merger proposal to Borg-Warner Corp at 46 dlrs per share
for all the company's common stock.
    Following a meeting yesterday with Borg-Warner officials
and investment bankers, GAF said, it is today delivering a
letter to the Borg-Warner board outling the terms of the
proposal that would be made by tender offer, pursuant to a
mutually acceptable merger agreement to be approved by the
Borg-Warner board and conditioned on that board's
recommendation of the tender offer and merger.
    GAF, in its letter, stated it intends to finance the
proposed acquisition entirely with its own funds and bank
borrowings under a syndicated bank loan from a group of banks
led by Chase Manhattan Corp's &lt;CMB> Chase Manhattan Bank.
    Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner
shares to 19.9 pct of those outstanding Minstar Inc &lt;MNST> sold
its 12.4 pct holding.
    GAF emphasized "the amicable nature of the proposed
transaction," which it characterized as a partnership.
    GAF said it wanted to discuss with the Borg-Warner board 
key roles for Borg-Warner's senior management in the new
organization, board representation for Borg-Warner directors on
a newly constituted board, and a company name change.
    GAF said it will be filing an amendment to its 13-D with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Borg-Warner has about 85.6 mln common shares outstanding.
    Minstar chairman Irwin L. Jacobs sold his stake after
Borg-Warner after the company failed to respond to his
mid-February offer for a negotiated agreement at a minimum
price of 44 dlrs a share.
    In November, Jacobs had offered to enter into acquisition
talks with Borg-Warner based on a price of between 43 and 48
dlrs a share.

product in the U.S. since 1972 due to a labeling impasse with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
    It said the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York modified an injunction against sale of the product
following a motion filed jointly by the company and the FDA.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that the current expansion, which he noted was in its fifth
year, will continue in the period ahead.
    He told the House Appropriations Committee that "there is
every prospect that the current expansion will continue
unabated through 1987 and the years beyond."
    Baker said interest rates over the period have continued to
decline and that "policies of the Federal Reserve assure that
ample credit was available.

envisioned that "we will maintain and improve upon our progress
in bringing down the rate of inflation."

that the agreement in Paris to cooperate in exchange rate
changes showed that the process of coordination agreed to at

    He told the House Appropriations Committee the meeting

    He noted that the industrial surplus countries committed
themselves to strengthen their growth prospects while the
deficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic imbalances.

    Baker said that for its part, Japan announced a cut in its
discount rate to 2.5 pct and committed itself to prepare a
comprehensive economic program to stimulate domestic demand
after the Diet completes action on the current budget.
    He said the United States must also do its share pressing

cuts.
    "And we must continue to oppose protectionist pressures,"
he added.

<TITLE>EUROTUNNEL NEEDS CAPITAL INCREASE BY END JULY, BENARD SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CALAIS, March 31 - &lt;Eurotunnel>, the Anglo- </DATELINE><BODY>French channel
tunnel consortium, needs to launch its planned 7.7-billion
franc third stage capital increase by end July to cover ongoing
project costs, French co-chairman Andre Benard said today.
    If the proposed public share offering was delayed beyond
then, Eurotunnel would have to find bridging finance, he told
reporters during a visit by French parliamentarians to the
construction site of the French tunnel terminal.
    Early elections in Britain could cause such a delay, he
noted.
    Britain's lower house of Parliament last month passed a
bill endorsing the construction of the 50-km (31-mile) tunnel.
The bill still needs approval of the upper house of Lords.
    Benard said the consortium had decided after lengthy
discussion to issue an identical mix of securities in the
London and Paris markets, but details of the precise package
had still to be decided.
    The offering would comprise approximately three billion
francs in each market with another 1.5 billion offered in the
United States, Japan and other European markets. Timing will be
set to take account of the French privatisation program.
   Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said the
ratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lower
house) early next month before passing to the Senate (upper
house) at the end of May.
    Eurotunnel officials expect work on the sites to start in
December or January. The tunnel should be completed by 1993 for
an overall cost of 50 billion francs.

<TITLE>AKZO PLANNING US INVESTMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ARNHEM, Netherlands, March 31 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch chemicals group Akzo
NV &lt;AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities
this year by making small acquisitions in the US.
   Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its
1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level
of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm
American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented
20 pct of Akzo's total capital.
   The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for
losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.
    He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in
the US, adding "It's the largest industrial market in the world."
But he said the company would also be looking at possible
acquisitions in Europe.
    Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan
acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the
company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.
   The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1
billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds
were in the United States.

<TITLE>NL INDUSTRIES &lt;NL> STUDIES SPIN OFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>NL Industries Inc said it would seek
an alternative to current plans to spin off its chemical
operations if an affiliate tries to block the plan.
    The company said the lessor of an NL Chemicals pigment
making plant in Leverkusen, West Germany, has indicated the
plan, without the lessors consent, would allow the lessor
 to buy the plant and terminate a
supplies and services agreement.
    NL said it disagrees with the lessor's position and will
seek its consent to the spin-off. If the lessor does not
consent, NL will pursue an alternative that will result in the
separation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.
    NL said it believes the alternative form of the separation
would not require the lessor's consent, which would not be
sought. The alternative would require approval by NL
shareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, it
said.
    As previously announced, NL plans to distribute shares of
NL Chemicals Inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemption
of NL's Series C preferred stock depositary receipts, when the
redemption is not likely to result in significant tax liability
to either NL or NL Chemicals.
    NL also said it may consider paying the redemption value of
the Series C preferred stock in cash instead of implementing
the spin-off or the alternative for separating the two
businesses.
    Under terms of the Series C preferred, NL at any time may
redeem the stock for cash. At Feb 28, 1987, the redemption
value was about 15 dlrs per depositary receipt, it said.

<TITLE>OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia faces a major medium term
adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said
in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.
    It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4
pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external
debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and
inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD
countries.
    A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis
for sustained non-inflationary growth and external
competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall
had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.
    A major shift of real resources to the external sector --
about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the
economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to
grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.
    Success depended on the setting of right policies including
tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector
borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.
    Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected
economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter
fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in
trade volumes.
    It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,
the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of
GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was
projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by
mid-1988.
    Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain
the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's
depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in
order to encourage business investment.
    The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by
developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing
industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to
correct its external imbalances.
    It added Australia should reduce protection levels in
manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no
doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.

organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
cane sugar crop also are good.
    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
acres sown last year.
    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
grains are "just awful," said Carter.
    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
sugarbeet growers association.
    "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"
Markwart said.
    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
    USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association.
    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
    The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
    "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
cane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding that
the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

<TITLE>U.S. FACTORY ORDERS ROSE 4.3 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>New orders for manufactured goods
rose 8.0 billion dlrs, or 4.3 pct, in February to a seasonally
adjusted 194.6 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    It was the largest one month rise in orders since a 4.8 pct
increase in September 1986, the department said.
    The February gain followed a revised orders drop in January
of 5.3 pct, the largest drop on record since the department
revised the statistics in 1982.
    The January decline was originally reported as 4.0 pct.
    Excluding defense orders factory orders rose 3.2 pct in
February after a 3.9 pct January decline.
    The new orders rise in February included an increase in
durable goods orders of 6.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct, to 101.9
billion dlrs. The department had estimated on March 24 that
February durable goods orders rose 6.0 pct.
    New orders for nondurable goods  were up 1.6 billion dlrs,
or 1.8 pct, in February to 92.7 billion dlrs, the department
said.
    These figures compared with a January decline of 9.8 pct in
durables orders and no change in nondurables orders in January.
    Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 47.8 pct, in
February after falling 38.5 pct in January.
    Orders for nondefense capital goods gained a slight 0.1 pct
in February after falling 8.6 pct in January.
    Within major industry categories, orders increases were
widespread. Transportation equipment was up 12.5 pct after
falling by 17.9 pct in January.
    Primary metals orders rose 12.7 pct in February after
dropping by 20.1 pct in January.
    Electrical machinery orders rose 6.9 pct in February after
dropping 15.4 pct in January.
    February shipments were up 5.8 billion dlrs, or 3.0 pct to
195.7 billion dlrs after falling 3.9 pct in January.
    Unfilled orders declined 1.1 billion dlrs, or 0.3 pct, to
369.4 billion dlrs.  It was the third consecutive monthly
decline in unfilled orders, the department said.
    Manufacturers' inventories were down slightly in February
to 320.4 billion dlrs after rising in January by 0.8 pct.

<TITLE>CSCE RESTRUCTURES COFFEE FUTURES DAILY LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "C"
contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents,
effective today, the CSCE said.
    The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby
positions, currently May and July, which trade without limits.
    In addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0
cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit
moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions,
according to the CSCE announcement.
    Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of
limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before
expanding the daily trading limit.
    Under new guidelines, if the first two restricted
deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchange
will expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain
in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two
limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent
limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions,
the CSCE said.

<TITLE>KANSAS EXCHANGE HITS CFTC POSITION LIMIT PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kansas City Board of Trade,
KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal
to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative
position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan
would put the the Kansas exchange "at a serious competitive
disadvantage."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month
proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200
contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900
contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.
    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat
speculative position limits unchanged.
    "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would
significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT
for speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of the
Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.
    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open
interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing
to raise CBT's limits.
    KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging
efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of
the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to
attract large speculators.
    The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its
proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same
bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.
    CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until
June 3.

<TITLE>FERRUZZI MAY FLOAT UP TO 49 PCT OF PARIS UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RAVENNA, Italy, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gruppo Ferruzzi is studying a
project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
pct of its French unit European Sugar (France) and could raise
around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln
dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."
    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA, is expected to absorb the European
corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc which
Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
gave no details.
    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
CPC business.

<TITLE>KEYCORP &lt;KEY> AGREES TO ACQUIRE UTAH BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALBANY, N.Y., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Keycorp said it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Commercial Security Bancorp
&lt;CSEC> by exchanging Keycorp common valued at 63 dlrs for each
Commercial Securities share.
    Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value
of 102 mln dlrs.
    Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will
be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for
an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition.
    Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a
minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged, the agreement
provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less
than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period, the
agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be
negotiated.
    Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to
Commercial Security shareholders. The company said it will
treat the merger as a pooling of interests.
    It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial
Security shareholders and various regulators.
    Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as
soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's
interstate banking law becomes operational.
    Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of
the Hemingway family who own about 30 pct of Commercial
Security's outstanding shares have agreed to vote in favor of
the transaction and not dispose of their stock.
     Based in Salt Lake City, Commercial Security ended 1986
with assets of 830.3 mln dlrs, net loans of 496.6 mln dlrs and
deposits of 707.9 mln dlrs. It had net income of 5.1 mln dlrs
or 3.16 dlrs a share on 1.6 mln average shares outstanding last
year.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp said in its annual report
that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
all oil and gas produced.
    The company said that it added about four pct to production
bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
    The company said that the average price for oil and gas
declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
    Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
oil sands in Canada.
    Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
and the Far East.
    But capital expenditures for exploration and production
were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
and further reductions were expected in 1987.
    Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
a new high of 422,000 bpd.
    The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
over the past several years.
    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
earnings gains from refining and marketing.
    Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
in 1985.
    The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
    Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
to extract higher proportions of light products.

<TITLE>NIGERIA IN MAJOR TARIFFS REVIEW BY JULY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LAGOS, MARCH 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nigerian government will carry out a
major review of import tariffs by the end of July, said member
of the ruling council and chief of general staff Rear-Admiral
Augustus Aikhomu, seen as the government's number two.
    "The comprehensive review will take care of items like spare
parts for vehicle assembly plants and machinery" he said.
    The government last reviewed tariffs in February following
the depreciation of the Nigerian naira by over 60 pct since the
currency was allowed to float last September.
    Aikhomu said the review was only an interim measure.
    Manufacturers saw the tariffs unfavourable to local
industries.
    Aikhomu repeated the government had not decided to remove
the remaining petroleum subsidies.
    He dismissed arguments that the move would increase
hardships faced by the poor due to the government's tough
economic adjustment programme as "sentimental and baseless."
    Last year, the government cut fuel subsidies by 80 pct but
this has since been lost to the naira's depreciation which has
made oil products cheap and a target of smuggling to
neighbouring countries.

<TITLE>SOVIET UNION SEEN WATCHING CHINA GATT APPLICATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's application to join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by
the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a
top European Community official said.
    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the
European Communities, told a news conference that China's
application would involve long and difficult negotiations.
    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
February presented a memorandum backing its application, which
De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
presented to China.
    "After China, other important state-trading countries
including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
China's application could be considered a test case," he said.
    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
Socialist GATT members.
    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
shortage would force China to import less this year and next
than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment
and capital.
    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and
today signed an agreement to open a European Community
Commission office in Peking.

<TITLE>DUTCH SEEK FOREIGN HELP IN TACKLING TAX FRAUD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Dutch Finance Ministry said it is
discussing with foreign fiscal authorities, primarily West
German and Belgian, possible means to combat evasion of tax on
interest payments received abroad.
    Finance Minister Onno Ruding told parliament yesterday he
aimed in 1988 to recoup about 100 mln guilders in tax revenue
on interest income both at home and abroad, and a further 300
mln by the end of 1990.
    He expected Dutch banks soon to start automatically
reporting interest payments they make, but this could prompt
more investors to open foreign accounts, Ruding said.
    There are no restrictions on Dutch capital flows, and the
ministry was therefore seeking co-operation from fiscal
authorities abroad to monitor interest paid on accounts held by
Dutch citizens, said spokesman Jaap Weeda.
    Ruding was largely motivated by guidelines laid down in the
centre-right government's policy plan which calls for the
ministry to boost its income by one billion guilders by 1990.
    Weeda said it was difficult to estimate taxation lost
through undeclared interest income, but Ministry figures
indicated that about 20 pct of such income was not declared.
    Ruding told parliament Dutch banks seemed willing to
co-operate in plans to report on interest payments, but they
foresaw practical problems.
    There was no firm target date for introducing reporting
procedures, but Ruding was adamant it must happen soon.
    "I cannot and will not accept any delay," he said.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT EASES IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders
to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's
weekly return showed.
    Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the
form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the
State, causing the money market deficit to ease.
    The Treasury's account with the Bank dropped 960 mln
guilders to 6.5 billion guilders.
    Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to
11.9 billion guilders.
    Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this
item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign
exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank.
     The Bank itself does not disclose information on
intervention.
    Seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190
mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders.
    Total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to
56.4 billion guilders.
    Call money and period rates were barely changed in the
week. Today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct.

<TITLE>MOODY'S LAUNCHES U.S. CORPORATE BOND INDEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
launched today a new index of investment grade U.S. corporate
bonds based on 100 issues.
    The rating agency noted that Commodity Exchange Inc, Comex,
filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in October
1986 a proposal to list a futures contract based on the index.
Trading is expected to start later this year.
    Moody's said it calculated end-of-month index values back
to December 1979. Corporate bond prices closed on Friday at
274.01, up from the index's initial value of 100.00 on December
31, 1979, the agency said.
    The Moody's index includes a sample of liquid bonds Moody's
chose to mirror the credit quality, maturity, duration and
coupon distribution of bonds in the industrial, utility and
financial sectors of the U.S. secondary market.
    However, it excludes convertible subordinated debenture
issues and tax-exempt bonds, as well as bonds with maturities
under five years or with variable-rate coupons.
    The rating agency said the index has been designed to
reflect changes in corporate bond prices as they occur
throughout the trading day.

    The combination of Republic's 459 mln dlrs in assets with
Pioneer's 125 mln dlrs would make the new holding company the
fifth largest savings and loan organization in Wisconsin, they

    The associations said the move is subject to approval by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Wisconsin Commissioner
of Savings and Loan, as well as Republic's shareholders and
Pioneer's depositors.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Gypsum Co, a unit of Aancor
Holdings Inc, said it filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission an amended registration statement covering up to 300
mln dlrs of 10-year priority senior subordinated notes.
    It previously filed a statement covering up to 600 mln dlrs
of such notes, National Gypsum said. The notes are part of a
refinancing plan that includes a new credit agreement with
domestic and foreign banks for 300 mln dlrs.
    Proceeds from the new notes and bank facility will be used
to terminate the company's current revolving credit facility by
repaying the approximate 400 mln dlr balance, it said.
    A total of 620 mln dlrs was originally drawn down under the
revolving credit facility on April 29, 1986, when National
Gypsum was acquired by a management-led investors group in a
leveraged buyout, the company said.
    National Gypsum said that the new credit agreement will
convert in 1990 to a term loan that will be amortized over four
years.
    It said the new notes will rank senior to the company's
existing 14-1/2 pct senior subordinated debentures of 2001 and
15-1/2 pct discount debentures due 2004.

<TITLE>POLAND RENEWS PARIS CLUB DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Poland met the Paris Club of western
creditor nations for renewed talks on rescheduling its debt
repayments but no conclusive result was expected, diplomatic
sources said.
    They said the discussions, led on the Polish side by deputy
Finance Minister Andrzej Doroscz, were to renew contacts agreed
after an inconclusive meeting in January and the talks were
described as a "technical meeting."
    The January talks focussed on the rescheduling of about 500
mln dlrs of interest and principal due by end-1986 and also
touched upon delays in debt repayments recheduled previously.
    Poland has a 33.5 billion dollar debt to western creditor
countries and commercial banks and has already indicated it
will not be able to meet interest payments this year after
falling behind for the past two years.
    "The Paris Club is demanding repayment but Poland needs new
credits and has made certain supplementary proposals, but it is
up to the Club to show an initiative," one of the diplomatic
sources said without elaborating.
    Poland is still continuing a dialogue with the
International Monetary Fund but this is progressing slowly, the
source said.
    One diplomatic source said the key to Poland's debt problem
lay in London, saying that the commercial bank creditors there
must take a practical position before a Paris Club decision.
    "But their position seems to be hardening," the source said.
"One really cannot expect a positive conclusion to today's
talks," the source added.

the Reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks

    Roberts made the comment at a press conference held by

said Roberts had been in touch with top Republican officials
recently.
    The possibility of an expansion of EEP to include wheat to
Moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry
sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the
Reagan administration before Secretary of State George Shultz
goes to Moscow in April.

    The seaway has said it expects little increase in freight

of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln
tonnes on the Welland Canal, which links Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. The canal is scheduled to open tomorrow.

    The company said the sale is subject to review by local

    The company said it has also entered into a 15.5 mln dlr

prepayment of all its obligations to members of its present
bank syndicate.
    The company said the new credit will also allow it to

    It said the new facility has allowed it to take full
advantage of an early payment discount of about 13 mln dlrs in

<TITLE>BEGHIN-SAY SAYS SUGAR OFFER TO EC STILL STANDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>A plan by European producers to sell
854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention
stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French
sugar producer Beghin-Say, said.
    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
export licensing policies.
    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.
    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and
that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
already lodged with intervention boards of different European
countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
cleared quality specifications.
    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention
stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC
regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the
sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of
sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000
tonnes.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> GAINS DUE TO STREAMLINED OPERATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct
increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were
partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated
for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest
crude oil prices in a decade.
    Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from
reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions
in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr
reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.
    The company said its more efficient operations would be
necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.
    The company also said that its share repurchase plan
contributed to the per share gains over 1985.
    In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses
slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the
previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes,
slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the
same period as the number of wells drilled was lower.
    The company was also able to use lower interest rates to
reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627
mln dlrs the previous year.
    Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6
pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.
    On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion
dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion
dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from
4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its
treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of
shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous
year.

<TITLE>U.S. STOCK MARKET OVERREACTS TO TARIFFS - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a U.S. decision
last week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computer
products.
    Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House
Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is "difficult to
comprehend" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs
in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.
    "I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that
(stock market fall), including simple profit-taking," Yeutter
said.
    Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from
its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the
computer chip dispute.
    "We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going to
affect a decision that's already been made," Yeutter said.
    The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs
on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged
failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. on
semiconductor trade.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN COOPERATION ABSOLUTE MUST - PHILIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GRONINGEN, the Netherlands, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>European countries
must cooperate closely if they want to save their electronics
industry from dropping to a third-rate global position, NV
Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PLGO.AS> chairman Cor van der
Klugt told a congress here.
    Noting that Europe was now a net importer of Integrated
Circuits, Van der Klugt said that in information technology,
the European Community had posted a trade deficit in 1984 of
five billion ecus compared with a 1975 surplus of 1.7 billion
ecus.
    Such factors were forcing European electronics companies to
seek cooperation with others both inside and outside Europe.
    Van der Klugt cited Western Europe's joint high-technology
research programme ESPRIT, sponsored by the European Community,
as a useful programme for what he called "pre-competitive
cooperation" with other companies in the same or related fields.
    The Philips president said companies should join such
efforts in an attempt to gain a foothold in markets of
strategic importance such as the U.S. And Japan.
    Working together, firms could produce on a larger scale and
more cheaply by sharing business risks and pooling together
development, marketing and production activities, he said.
    As an example, Van der Klugt pointed to Philips'
telecommunications joint venture with AT and T &lt;T.N> of the
U.S. To form &lt;APT>, working on digital telephone exchange
projects.
    "Only the largest companies can recoup the billions of
dollars involved in development in this area," he said, adding
that the world market offered room for no more than seven or
eight manufacturers of such products.

<TITLE>WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unfavorable late winter weather
conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,
the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.
    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
that followed a period of warm weather.
    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.
    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which
show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf
and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.
    The report said that since much of the early growth in
February was from late seeding rather than from normal
development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive
than some local observers say.
    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields
on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and
chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.
    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which
would aid recovery.

president and chief executive officer, of Rocky Mount
Undergarment Co Inc, said he expects the company to show a
profit for the first quarter fiscal 1987.
    Weiss said sales for 1987 have been strong following a net
loss of 1,548,000 dlrs, or 53 cts a share, for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1986. The company reported a net loss for the
year of 2,408,000 dlrs, or 82 cts a share.
    Rocky Mount recorded net income of 248,000 dlrs, or eight
cts per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1986.
    Weiss attributed the poor year to problems involving
management, manufacturing operations, financial condition and
credibility among its suppliers.
    Weiss predicted the pattern of quarterly lossses which
characterized 1986 will be reversed and 1987 will see the
company return to profitability.

    Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting
the envoy, "I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga
recommended." Nakasone did not elaborate.
    The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when
President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy
tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged
Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact.
    Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the
Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers
and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project,
party sources said.
    The LDP international economic affairs council was
responding to Nakasone's request for measures to reduce Japan's
increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said.

Lyng declined to confirm statements made today by a farm state
congressman that the United States will offer subsidized wheat
to the Soviet Union within the next 10 days to two weeks.
    When asked to clarify comments by Rep. Pat Roberts of
Kansas that the administration would soon offer Export
Enhancement wheat to the Soviet Union Lyng said, "well it won't
be today," and then added, "we have no official comment one way
or the other."
    Lyng would not comment on whether a wheat subsidy offer to
the USSR is under more active consideration at the USDA, saying
that any remarks by him would be tantamount to an official
announcement and could be construed inappropriately.

<TITLE>NEW GASOLINE GRADE TO RAISE U.S. REFINING COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     SAN ANTONIO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>A new grade of unleaded gasoline
now being test marketed will increase refining costs when
refiners can least afford it, according to officials attending
the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.
    The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of
89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular
unleaded gasoline.
     Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has test-marketed the new mid-grade
gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,
East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul
Collier, executive vice president of marketing.
    Phillips Petroleum &lt;P> expects to begin marketing the new
89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.
    Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89
octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of
dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity
and intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.
    But not all oil company's welcome the introduction of
another grade of unleaded gasoline.
    "Three grades are not warranted," said Henry Rosenberg,
chairman of Crown Central Petroleum &lt;CNP>. "Refiners will have
to upgrade again," he added.
    "An investment will have to be made," said Archie Dunham,
executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an
operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp &lt;DD> in order to upgrade
refinery operations.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CANADIAN PACIFIC &lt;CP> AIMS TO UP EQUITY RETURN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Pacific Ltd's principal aim
over the next few years will be to significantly increase the
company's return on equity, it said in the annual report.
    Canadian Pacific's return on average capital employed fell
to 4.7 pct in 1986 from 5.9 pct in the prior year. Return on
average shareholders' equity declined to 2.5 pct from 4.8 pct
in 1985.
    "To achieve this goal will require that the businesses
comprising Canadian Pacific are leaders in their respective
fields," the company said in the report to shareholders.
    "Although the steps already taken to reposition and solidify
Canadian Pacific point to a better financial performance in
1987, more remains to be accomplished if the company is to
produce returns that meet shareholder expectations," it said.
    Canadian Pacific previously reported 1986 operating net
profit fell to 150.1 mln dlrs from 252.7 mln dlrs in the prior
year. Revenues were 15.02 billion dlrs compared to 15.04
billion dlrs in 1985.
    It said emphasis will continue on reducing dependence on
cyclical industries and strengthening the asset mix.
    Canadian Pacific said 1986 results were disappointing, but
the company took several steps towards reviewing assets and
operations and rationalizing its asset base.
    As previously reported, it sold its 52.5 pct interest in
Cominco Ltd &lt;CLT> for 472 mln dlrs in October, 1986 and
Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd for 300 mln dlrs in January,
1987.
    Including other asset sales, Canadian Pacific's
consolidated assets fell to 17.70 billion dlrs at year end from
21.3 billion dlrs at the end of 1985, it said.
    The company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln
dlrs in 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the
year.
    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown
representing permanent impairment in asset values, partially
offset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest in
Cominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'
flight kitchens.
    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of
172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included in
first quarter results.
    Canadian Pacific said despite lower earnings and
extraordinary charges, its overall cash position strengthened
in 1986 as cash generated from operations and asset sales was
more than sufficient to finance capital expenditures of 1.80
billion dlrs.
    Long term debt fell to 4.50 billion dlrs from 6.22 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    Consolidated 1987 capital spending will be reduced
considerably from 1986 levels, mainly due to the Cominco and
air line unit sales, it said. Spending commitments totalled 239
mln dlrs at the end of 1986.

The company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln dlrs
in 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the year.
    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown

<TITLE>ARVIN &lt;ARV> SES FLAT 1ST QTR RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLUMBUS, Ind., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Arvin Industries Inc said higher
interest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions will
produce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.
    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the
quarter.
    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern
of automotive replacement parts in that period.
    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second
quarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.
    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed
1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,
while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.
    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln
and earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.
    It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader
Automotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.
    Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will
not conform to historical patterns for the year because the
acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different
quarters.
    He said Arvin will complete the purchase of Systems
Research Laboratories in the second quarter of 1987. This will
also increase revenues.

<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX>,
which designed Brazil's only nuclear plant, has agreed to pay
50 mln dlrs compensation for errors made during the project,
the plant's operators said.
    A spokesman for &lt;Furnas Centrais Eletricas>, a state
utility which runs the Angra One power station, confirmed a
statement made in Washington last week by company president
Camilo Penna.
    Penna did not say what errors had been made and the utility
spokesman said he could not add to Penna's statement.
    The 636-megawatt plant, dogged by technical problems,
started operating in January 1985, but since January 1986 has
not worked at all due to a variety of problems, the utility
spokesman said.
    The country originally intended to have eight more power
stations after Angra One, using West German technology.
    Work on one plant, Angra Two, began and then stopped when
funding ran out. Penna told the Jornal do Brasil that the state
utility was receiving money from the government to finish Angra
Two and build another plant, Angra Three.

<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mozambique appealed for an additional
160 mln dlrs in emergency humanitarian aid to help the country
through a severe economic crisis.
    Prime Minister Mario Machungo told a news conference
several countries -- notably the U.S., Britain and Italy -- had
already made pledges towards this new appeal.
    The U.S. offered grain amounting to a third of the nation's
annual consumption, Britain offered eight mln stg and Italy was
expected to offer 30 to 35 mln dlrs, he said.
    The country's "extremely severe economic crisis" stemmed from
continued fighting with "armed bandits" -- a euphemism for
anti-government guerrillas -- and a series of floods which have
destroyed crops, Machungo said.
    An estimated four million people require emergency care.

<TITLE>WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shifts from mild to very cold
weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown
winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the
U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
    In a field report, the officer said indications were that
winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared
with 38,000 last year.
    He said the damage was probably more limited in southern
and central regions and most widespread in the north.
    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where
little or no snow cover was present, he added.
    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine
during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well
developed plants and for winter barley.
    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing
water occurred in the fields.
    The officer said repairing damage will probably call for
special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and
where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed
applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS U.S. BACKS STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the United States and the five other industrialized nations
signing the recent Paris Accord remain committed to fostering
the exchange rate at around current levels.
    But he declined to comment on what he believed to be an
appropriate level of the dollar in world markets.
    "I'm not going to comment on that because invariably the
exchange markets read either more or less into my remarks than
I might intend," he said in response to a question from the
House Appropriations Committee.
    Baker said the six nations participating in the Paris
meeting in February had "acknowledged that the currencies are
within ranges that are broadly consistent with the economic
fundamentals and we and the others as well remain prepared to
cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around
those levels."

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain trade analysts expect a sharp
drop in corn acreage, with most expecting a more modest decline
in soybeans, in the U.S. Agriculture Department, USDA,
plantings intentions report due out at 1500 est (2100 gmt).
    The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was
66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below
the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by
the USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only
60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced.
    The average soybean planted acreage quesstimate was 59.49
mln, ranging from 58.0 to 63.0 mln and compared with the 61.48
mln planted in 1986
    With substantial grain stocks, less interest was expressed
among analysts in the USDA stocks report also scheduled today.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> TO LIMIT DIRECTORS' LIABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     NEW YORK, MARCH 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp said that it will move to
protect its directors from liabilities arising from lawsuits
charging gross negligence.
    Exxon said directors' liabilities will be limited and they
will be indemnified for actions taken in pursuit of duties.
    The company said it was taking the opportunity to change
its bylaws and incoroporation certificate following changes in
the law of New Jersey, where the company is incoporated.
    The measures are being submitted to shareholders and will
be voted on at Exxon's annual meeting to be held May 21 in New
Orleans the company said in proxy material sent to
shareholders.
    Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the
company's certificate to eliminate directors' maximum personal
monetary liability to the limit New Jersey allows.
    New Jersey recently permitted corporations to eliminate
monetary liability directors and owners may incur for breach of
duty care owed by them to corporations and shareholders.
    The company said that the principal effect of the measure
"will be to eliminate potential monetary damage actions against
directors."
    But the amendment will only limit liability in the event of
unintentional errors.
    It does not limit their liability for actions taken in
knowing violation of the law, nor will it limit potential
liabilities from violations of federal securities laws, the
company said in its proxy statemernt.
    A second measure proposed to shareholders is an amendment
to bylaws already voted on by the directors at their January
Board meeting making indeminifiacation of directors mandatory.
    Exxon said that it had currently purchased such insurance
from a captive insurance copany in the amount of 50 mln dlrs in
excess of 50 mln dlrs issued by independent companies to Exxon
to indemnify its directors.

Investment said its regular quarterly dividend distribution
will be lower than its present 26 cts per share, and could be

    The company, which lowered the payout from 27 cts to 26 cts
this current quarter, said it did not know how low the payout
would go.
    The company said the reason for the cutbacks was because it
would not be purchasing a property it had anticipated, and
alternative investments will produce significantly lower yields
than anticipated.

<TITLE>PORTUGAL PLANS ECONOMIC MODERNISATION PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's minority centre-right
government, which faces a crucial censure vote in parliament on
Friday, unveiled an eight-year economic plan aimed at reducing
foreign debt and boosting jobs and investment.
    Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva told reporters the plan
was a blueprint for modernisation focusing on cutting
Portugal's 9.6 pct unemployment, or 400,000 people.
    The program was approved at a cabinet meeting of the
16-month-old Social Democratic Party (PSD) government.
    The censure motion has been proposed by a centre-left party
which says the government has failed to tackle economic ills.
    Left-wing opposition parties, who together hold a majority
in parliament, have indicated they intend to vote against the
minority government, which would automatically fall if
defeated.
    A first phase of the government plan foresees annual growth
in investment of between eight and 10 pct over the next four
years. Government figures show investment grew 10 pct last year
compared with a fall of three pct in 1985.
    The plan foresees this leading to creation of 32,000 new
jobs a year.
    The program also foresees government spending cuts,
particularly in the public sector, reducing the state budget
deficit to around five pct of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
1990 from nearly 11 pct in 1986.
    Portugal's foreign debt, which totals more than 16 billion
dlrs, was forecast to be reduced to the equivalent of 24 pct of
GDP in 1990 from around 55 pct at end-1986.
    Detailed forecasts were not released for beyond 1990.

    He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because the
energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a

prices would harm U.S. competitiveness.

<TITLE>BANGEMANN CALLS FOR CURRENCY CALM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Economics Minister Martin
Bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by
both official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm
was needed on the foreign exchanges.
    Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair,
Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had
left their mark on exports and investments. He added that
without these external difficulties, West Germany's economy
would have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct
reported.
    Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate
in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not
in a downtrend.
    The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said
mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for
smaller and medium sized firms.
    Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel
industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means
when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines
on grants.
    He added that in light of the declining demand for steel
capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would
not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in
this industry.
    Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called
for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post
Office.
    The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany,
especially as far as deciding who is able to provide
telecommunications equipment.

<TITLE>DUTCH STATE LOAN RAISES 3.25 BILLION GUILDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Dutch Finance Ministry said it
accepted bids totalling 3.25 billion guilders on its 6.25 pct
bullet bond due 1995, which it priced at 100.8 pct at tender
today for an effective yield of 6.12 pct.
    The ministry accepted 50 pct of bids at the issue price.
Higher bids were met in full.
    The loan, which has a May 1 coupon and paydate, will go
towards the government's financing of an estimated 1987
borrowing requirement of about 42 billion guilders.
    The 1987 budget deficit is some 29 billion guilders and
early repayments on state loans are estimated at 13 billion.
    Because of projected early redemptions to the state of
loans by building corporations, analysts predict the state has
to raise 32 billion guilders on the capital markets this year,
of which it has found 4.5 billion guilders on the private
placement market.
   The finance ministry described today's tender as successful
and said the amount raised reflected a change in market
circumstances since the last loan issue together with
international demand for guilder-denominated paper.
    Following today's tender, the fourth state loan for payment
in 1987, a nominal 10.55 billion guilders has been raised by
public issues, bringing the total raised this year to 18.55
billion guilders, or some 44.2 pct of the state's 1987
borrowing requirement.
    The previous state loan, a 6.25 pct issue due 1998/2002
last month, raised a mere 300 mln guilders.
    Analysts said the small amount raised on the last issue was
because it was a return to a split maturity issue, seen as only
attractive to domestic institutions, from bullet loans.
    The finance ministry said then the amount was low but noted
a number of unfavourable market conditions at the time.
    Bullet loans have only been permitted in the Dutch market
since January, 1986, as part of a financial liberalization
plan.
    Bullet loans have attracted considerable foreign demand but
have also given rise to worries their fixed repayment date
might interfere with intricate redemption schemes built up
around previously issued split maturity bonds, dealers said.

<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Tex., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pier 1 Imports Inc said it
amended its record and distribution dates for its previously-
announced three-for two common and 25 cts preferred stock
split.
    The split common and 25 cts preferred shares will be
distributed on July 2, 1987, to shareholders of record June 24,
1987.
    The stock split requires shareholder approval of an
increase in authorized shares of common stock to 100 mln from
25 mln and an increase of authorized shares of preferred stock
to five mln from one mln, the company said.
    The change in the dates was based on the company's desire
to have the additional common and 25 cts preferred shares trade
for the shortest practical period of time on a "when issued"
basis following a favorable shareholder vote at the annual
meeting June 24, it said.
    The previously announced record and distribution dates were
May 13, 1987, and June 29, 1987, respectively, the company
said.

<TITLE>NORTHROP &lt;NOC> TO SPEND 70 MLN ON R AND D</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northrop Corp plans to spend 70 mln
dlrs this year for company-funded research and development on
aircraft programs, including the Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) program, compared with 32 mln dlrs of expenditures in
1986, the company said in its annual report.
    The 1986 expenditures excluded a 236 mln dlr writeoff to
cover the termination of the company-funded F-20 development
project.
    Last year one team headed by Northrop and another led by
Lockheed Corp &lt;LK> won contracts valued at 691 mln dlrs to
build ATF prototypes.
    The contractors have agreed to a cost sharing plan on the
development phase of the project.
    The Air Force plans to select the winning team in 1991,
which will then produce some 750 aircraft with a total contract
value of an estimated 45 billion dlrs.
    In addition, Northrop said it expects 1987 expenditures for
plant and equipment to be about the same as the 364 mln dlrs
spent in 1986.
    The funding will be devoted principally to new equipment
for research and development and high efficiency production,
Northrop said.
    The company also said it plans to construct a new
manufacturing facility in Perry, Ga., where it will conduct
work on a tactical missile system program called Tacit Rainbow,
which is intended for use by all three armed services and
foreign nations.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker and
Office of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended an
administration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves.
    In response to hostile questioning from a member of the
House Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan was
justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to
get the government out of the oil business.
    Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3
billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2
billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of
oil from the reserves.
    Miller said the sale price may end up higher.
    "We'd sell it to the highest bidder," Miller said.
    "If we can get more we'll take it."

<TITLE>TRADERS CUT BAHIA TEMPORAO COCOA CROP ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade estimates of the coming
May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing
state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
been harsher than thought earlier.
    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
plantations because of low returns on their investment.
    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
past six months coupled with low bean prices.
    If such economies continue into the winter months both the
temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
normally be treated against the disease.
    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
these are not yet significant.
    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
bulk will not appear until the last month, September.
    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent
condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will
lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker,
asked whether he was concerned about yesterdays precipitous
decline in bond prices, said he was not.
    Questioned by reporters as he left a House committee
hearing, Baker said "no," when asked about the bond decline,
adding that it was a reflection of concern about the
possibility of a trade war.
    "It is what the markets think would be the adverse
consequences of a trade war."
    He said the administration was concerned that protectionism
would lead to international trade problems adding that he
thought the action against the Japanese was still consistent
with this policy.

Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.
    Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement

    Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third

<TITLE>IRISH BUDGET CUTS DEFICIT TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ireland's new minority government
presented a tough budget that trimmed public spending across
the board. The current budget deficit target was set at 1.20
billion punts, which is 6.9 pct of GNP. This compared with the
1986 figure of 1.395 billion punts, 8.5 pct of GNP.
    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry told parliament "Conditions
are extremely difficult and there is no room at all for soft
options." The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement was 1.85 billion
punts, 10.7 pct of GNP, compared with 2.145 billion punts or
13.0 pct of GNP last year.
    MacSharry announced a wage freeze for Ireland's 187,000
civil servants and said all new civil service jobs had to be
approved by him. Mortgage interest relief was cut, some housing
grants axed and social welfare and health costs trimmed. Income
tax and excise duties were left unchanged.
    Eager to stop the outflow of funds from Ireland, he said "We
must do more to encourage non-residents, and especially
expatriates, to invest in the Irish economy."
    Without giving details, he also said Ireland wished to
provide the right conditions and a favourable taxation climate
for developing the international fnnancial services sector.

<TITLE>U.S. TAX AGENCY INCREASES INTERNATIONAL AUDITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
said it was stepping up compliance efforts by its international
staff to recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year
in unpaid taxes.
    The agency was shifting emphasis by its international
branch to increase compliance by the 47,000 foreign-owned
American companies and foreign firms operating in the United
States, IRS officials said at a news conference.
    The IRS also was taking a closer look at compliance by
Americans living abroad and by taxpayers in the United States
with income from overseas investments.
    Percy Woodard, assistant IRS commissioner, international,
denied that the agency was picking on foreign companies, but he
said fewer of them pay taxes than comparable U.S. firms.
    In some industries, one pct of foreign firms paid U.S.
taxes, he said. Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreign
companies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S.
firms.
    "If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfill
their tax-paying responsibilities in that country, then
foreigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing,"
Woodard said.
    In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans who
live abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3
billion dlrs a year, Woodard said.
    The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and
actually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.
    Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail to
report foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreign
operations can underreport income, Woodard said.
    The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100    
examiners to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase,
which should lead to more tax return audits.
    The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends or
practices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance with
tax laws, Woodard said.
    The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, but
Woodard denied it was because of the trade dispute over
semiconductors between the United States and Japan.
    The agency next will turn its attention to the automobile,
computer and motorcycle industries.
    The IRS will also receive information on anyone who applies
for a U.S. passport or permanent residence in the United States
to help indentify those who do not file returns.

<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia has reached an agreement
with Western creditors on refinancing a portion of its 19.7
billion dollar hard currency debt.
    The official Tanjug news agency said the agreement was
reached in Paris today in talks between Yugoslav delegation
headed by Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovic and 16 Western
creditor countries, but it gave no precise figures for the
amount to be rescheduled.
    However, before the talks began, Tanjug said the agreement
should cover 1.6 billion dollars of debt due this year and 3.5
billion due in 1988.
    The agreement covered a second phase of multi-year
refinancing of Yugoslavia's debt, based on a protocol signed in
May last year, which provided for the enhanced monitoring of
economic trends in Yugoslavia by International Monetary Fund.
    Tanjug said the agreement was reached after hearing the
IMF's report on the state of Yugoslav economy and a +long and
lively debate between creditors and members of the Yugoslav
delegation.+
    It said the talks with commercial bank creditors on
realisation of the second phase of Yugoslavia's multi-year debt
refinancing will follow in April this year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on
superpower arms control moves and trade issues.
    French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to
present France's concern that the United States might ignore
European security interests in any accord with Moscow on
removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.
    But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not
agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give
the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats
said.
    France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles
from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in
other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,
conventional forces and chemical weapons.
    Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position
saying: "Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should
mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles."
    Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a
dispute between two leading research institutes over patent
rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.
    In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur
Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of
Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from
the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight
against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
    "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American
cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join
their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of
speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure," Reagan
said at the signing ceremony. 
    He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80
per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.
    The foundation would also raise private funds and would
donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less
developed countries. 
    Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the
United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House
East Room, with Reagan describing France as "America's oldest
ally in war and peace." 
    "I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the
same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers
which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new
diseases and drugs," Chirac replied.
    But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on
over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise
in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. 
    A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to
sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of
lessening surplus stocks.
    Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first
proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,
during his two-day visit to Washington.
    The U.S. official described the idea as a "grain producers'
OPEC" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan
administration's desire to lessen government intervention in
trade.

<TITLE>CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claudia Van Riesen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's airline industry, shaken up by
a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive
for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.
    "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,"
said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.
"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."
    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr
takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week
as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.
    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the
6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's
50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
pct.
    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and
cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four
decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
Ltd.
    They said CP Air's management style had been not much
different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because
neither airline was held accountable to its owners.
    "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these
two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither
seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley.
    "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very
conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air
Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said.
    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than
profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of
Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.
    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated
long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its
losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.
    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this
year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on
revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more
than 2 billion dlrs.
    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of
increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
attention to finances, analysts said.
    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in
excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit
recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.
    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,
attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.
    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air
traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from
cost-cutting and careful spending.
    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new
competition makes profit growth less certain.
    "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At
one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
else's," Friend said.
    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
shares for at least a year.
    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a
public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
without setting off a political storm.
    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.
    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,
already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of
a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered
six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the
Boeing Co.
    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,
needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
hurting profits.
    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8
mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.

<TITLE>U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
analysts and traders said.
    They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
and four mln barrels.
    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
    For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
    API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
    The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
    Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
March 27.
    API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
    Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
partially reflected in today's gains, they added.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> ALTERNATIVE PLAN DUE WITHIN A WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>A. William Reynolds, chairman and
chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to
announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile
tender within a week.
    Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the
tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the
group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate
GenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond."
    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal
challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York
City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.
    Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain
of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to
sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.
    Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were
dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
already approved the station's sale.
    Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
said. He provided no other details.
    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
have been telling him "Bill, just don't pay greenmail" to end
the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
said he considers it a "repugnant device."
    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffen
the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."
    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
"we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
change in control."
    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, "We
know the company, we know the values and we know the
opportunities better than any outside group."
    In response to a question about whether any units are up
for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Avery Inc said the company will not
show a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a
profit in 1987.
    Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman
Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become
profitable.
    Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would
increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated
acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits
for some time.
    At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the
authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.
    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a
loss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year
to end Sept 30.
    The increase in common shares would cover, among other
things, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's &lt;TRI> and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation to
Avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last
year.

<TITLE>TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Ress, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The threatened trade war between the
United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that
economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.
    But they are not so sure if that would be a brief
corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices
mark the start of a "bear" market.
    "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien,
economist at American Express International Bank in London.
    Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has
poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded
a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of
any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the
Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the
dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it
fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of
improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or
because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,
may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget
deficit.
   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will
have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the
gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.
Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The
subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls
on the world stock markets.
    "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,"
said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain."
    Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming
economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in
the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and
huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.
    Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith
Barney Harris Upham said  "We're still in a bull market," adding
that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "The
bear usually strikes slowly."
    Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in
London, said the huge sums of money going through the world
financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.
    Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in
non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very
difficult to see where else they can put their money than in
U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,
according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi
Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.
    He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now
to the French franc and West German mark.
    In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and
the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE SAYS STOCK MARKET SOUND AND STRONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater shrugged off yesterday's sharp decline on Wall
Street, saying the administration believes the stock market is
"fundamentally sound."
    Fitzwater attributed Monday's 57 point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average at the closing bell to "technical
decisions" and said President Reagan's decision to impose trade
sanctions against Japan might have also contributed.
    "There are a lot of reasons that can cause this, but the
underlying fact is that we believe the market is very strong
and sound," he said.
    Fitzwater said the stock market had risen 239 pct since
Reagan took office on January 20, 1981.
    "The market, we believe, is fundamentally sound," he said.
    The presidential spokesman noted that at mid-day, the
market had recovered some of the losses that occurred on
Monday, when the third-worst one-day slump in Wall Street
history occurred.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously
resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
    "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
to remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
steps toward a transaction.
    "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
battles I've seen," said one analyst.
    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
from that company's restructuring.
    "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
share," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
carried out a wider share repurchase.
    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
seeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by the
company at a premium.
    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
financing the transaction.
    Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
tender offer and merger.
    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
debt from the transaction.
    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
   "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
substantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
current holdings.
    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
equipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S.
and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,"
Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and
Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said.
    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards. It also has an information services business,
and is trying to sell its financial services business.
    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
Carbide shares.

<TITLE>USDA FOREIGN POSTS THREATENED BY TIGHT BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department will
be forced to close 13 foreign posts and reduce personnel in
five others unless Congress approves two mln dlrs in
supplemental appropriations for fiscal 1987 to cover increased
overseas costs due to changes in the value of currencies, a
senior department official said.
    Thomas Kay, administrator of USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service, FAS, told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture
Subcommittee that the devaluation of the U.S. dollar since 1985
has raised USDA's costs in many of its 75 offices overseas.
    Kay declined to say which posts were jeopardized by rising
foreign costs.
    In Europe and Japan, the dollar's decline is expected to
raise the costs of running offices staffed by agricultural
attaches and trade officers by 2.5 mln dlrs in the current
fiscal year compared with 1985 estimates, according to FAS
projections.
    Favorable exchange rate changes are expected to cut FAS
spending by about 510,000 dlrs elsewhere, FAS said.
    The House Appropriations Committee has approved one mln
dlrs in supplemental funds to cover FAS losses. The full House
may take up the measure, folded into a government-wide
supplemental appropriations bill, next week.
    Staff on the House panel said the committee balked at
appropriating two mln dlrs because the White House budget
office turned down FAS's request for the supplemental.

<TITLE>USDA'S AMSTUTZ "SYMPATHETIC" TO WOOD CREDITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
Daniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. wood
producers' desire to have their exports eligible for government
credit guarantees.
    But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture
subcommittee that including wood products in the department's
short- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs would
conflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.
    Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible for
government export credit guarantee because they are considered
"manufactured products," Amstutz said.
    He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time to
considering making wood products eligible for the guarantees
and that Congress was considering a measure to do so.

<TITLE>PENNZOIL &lt;PZL> WILL CONSIDER SETTLEMENT OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
told a meeting of securities analysts that the company will
consider any realistic settlement offer in its 11.0 billion dlr
ongoing litigation with Texaco Inc &lt;TX>.
    "I wish I could tell you that I am optimistic about the
chances (of a settlement), but I am not," Liedtke said. "I
assure you, however, that we will continue to try."
    He said that Pennzoil has made a number of settlement
offers to Texaco both before the litigation commenced and
after, but the offers were repeatedly rejected. He said Texaco
has made no realistic offers.
    Earlier this year, a Texas court of appeals upheld
Pennzoil's claim against Texaco, ruling that Texaco unlawfully
interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil.
Texaco subsequently acquired Getty.
    Liedtke said it has become more difficult to settle the
case because the courts continually rule in its favor, raising
the stakes of any agreement.
    "Each time this goes up (to a higher court), the
expectations of our shareholders goes up and it puts us in an
increasingly difficult positon," he said.
    "We cannot afford to settle this case for a pittance,"
Liedtke told the meeting of analysts.
    "We don't want to get sued for not fulfilling our fiduciary
responsibilities," he said.
    Liedtke also said that the company would not settle for
less than two billion dlrs, which has been suggested by a
number of Wall Street analysts.
    He did say, however, that Pennzoil would entertain any
proposal from Texaco including a possible preferred stock
position in TExaco.
    "I won't assume we'll take it," he said. "But we'd consider
it." But he added that he thought it would be extremely
difficult to work out a settlement made up of stocks, bonds and
cash.
    Liedtke, who earlier said the company would have a lower
first quarter, also told reporters that the company expected
lower earnings this year.
    "We think earnings will probably be down this year," he
said. Last year the company earned 1.28 dlrs a share from
continuing operations or 68.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.9
billion dlrs.
    The earnings figure comes before an extraordinary loss of
56 cts a share or 23.1 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>DIAMOND &lt;DIA> SPINOFF TO HAVE 60/40 DEBT/EQUITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the
refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond
Shamrock Corp told Reuters that the new company will have a
debt to equity ratio of 60/40.
    Hemminghaus said cash flow between 80 and 120 mln dlrs per
year will reverse the ratio to 40/60 within two years.
    He said the spinoff, to be called Diamond Shamrock R and M
Inc, will probably occur just before the annual meeting of 
Diamond Shamrock Corp. The annual meeting is scheduled for
April 30 in Dallas, he said. Hemminghaus was in San Antonio for
the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
    An effort by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens to take over
Diamond Shamrock was a reason behind the company's decision to
spinoff, although a spinoff may have occurred anyway,
Hemminghaus said.
    He said that investment advisors told the company Pickens'
offer was inadequate and suggested the company split up into a
pure exploration and production upstream operation and a pure
play downstream refining and marketing company.
    He said he is hopes to raise 400 mln dlrs in financing for
the new company.
    Hemminghaus said 65 to 75 pct of the new company's earnings
will come from wholesale refining, 20 to 30 pct will come from
the retail sale of gasoline and other items at gasoline
convenience store locations, and five to 10 pct from natural
gas liquids and storage and marketing.
    "Growth will be defined in building retail volumes, jobber
volumes and refining capacity after that," Hemminghaus told
Reuters. He said the new company will have a capital spending
budget of 35 to 55 mln dlrs a year.

<DATELINE>    KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said its staff has ordered Philadelphia Electric Co
to shut down the Peach Bottom Nuclear Power Plant at Delta, Pa.
    The NRC noted that one Peach Bottom unit is shut down for
refuling and said the other must be brought to cold shutdown
within 36 hours. Neither unit may be restarted without the
commission's approval, the regulatory body said.
    The NRC said it received information on March 24 that
control room operators at Peach Bottom had been observed
sleeping while on duty in the control room.
    It said the information indicated this conduct was
pervasive and has been occurring for some time, and that shift
supervision had knowledge of this situation.
    In response to this information, the regulators said, they
initiated 24-hour inspection coverage of the plant's control
room, which is ongoing.
    To date, the NRC said, its inspection has established
operations control room staff has at times during various
shifts, particularly the 2300 to 0700 shift, slept or otherwise
been inattentive to duties over the past five months.
    The commission said it also found management either knew
and condoned the sleeping and inattention, or should have known
about it, and either took no action or inadequate action to
correct this situation.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO ANNOUNCE NEW DEBT CONVERSION PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela will shortly announce a new
plan to allow private companies to repay their foreign debts
with equity and for public debt to be converted into private
sector investments, cntral bank president hernan anzola said.
    Anzola told a meeting of the banking association yesterday
the new plan, to be called exchange agreement no. 4, will be
announced in mid-april.
    He said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaid
private sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stock
in the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to those
already in effect in other latin american nations, he said.
    at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have already
taken place in venezuela. In 1984, a group of 17 U.S. Banks led
by citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cervecera
nacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.
    Anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow for
conversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelan
private industry.
    Holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able to
exchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct of
their nominal value, which could be turned into private
investment in priority areas.
    This, anzola said, would mean a reduction in the amount of
the public sector debt and an increase in foreign investment.
He stressed that the public sector debt bonds will not be
exchanged for shares of stock in state-owned companies.
    Anzola said exchange rates for these transactions will
depend the type of investment the creditor intends to make,
with export-oriented companies to be favored.
    Venezuela issued a new plan in december for the repayment
of 7.8 billion dlrs in private sector foreign debt. Under the
scheme, debtors are able to buy dollars at the preferential
7.50 bolivars rate, but must also pay a premium.

<TITLE>CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moderate to heavy rain continued
over early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi,
Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in the
week ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of
the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture
for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas,
and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have
washed out some rice fields requiring replanting.
     Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil
moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start
due to earlier dryness, it said.
    In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat
in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing
crop moisture requirements, it said.
    Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were near
normal, the agency noted.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outcome of negotiations on
proposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax
on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains
difficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de
Keersmaeker told a news conference.
    De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministers
which ended today, was asked about reports enough countries
were against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in
negotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.
    He said it was true some countries were strongly opposed,
but others were less so and others basically in favour.
    "I think there is room for negotiations, and I would not
want to make any predictions at this stage," de Keersmaeker
said.
    Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain,
West Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark were
opposed to the measure. Between them these countries have more
than enough voting power to block it.
    Diplomatic sources said at today's meeting the Spanish
delegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.

ministers agreed to extend the 1986/87 milk and beef marketing
years to the end of May, Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker

    He said the reason for the two-month extension of the only

months was that it would be impossible for ministers formally
to agree 1987/88 farm price arrangements before May 12.
    This is when the European Parliament is due to deliver its
opinion on price proposals from the EC Commission.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS THREAT OF TRADE WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan has reaffirmed his
opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade
sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.
    "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as
telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French
official expressed concern about the rising tide of
protectionist sentiment in the United States.
    Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials
"do not believe this will result in a trade war."
    "It is the first time that the United States has taken an
action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to
be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added.
    "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade
war," he said.
    Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the
Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an
agreement to make some corrections."
    Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress
and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he
said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."
    Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well
considered by this administration and not taken lightly."
    While the White House official held open the possibility
that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he
indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head
off the sanctions.
    "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a
settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions)
from going into effect is questionable at this point," the
spokesman said.
    The sanctions take effect in mid-April.

    He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was
sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute
over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,
but "I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."
    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.
    He also said he did not think there would be a trade war
with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
United States to risk such a war.
    "Those fears are unfounded," he said.
    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
effect.
    Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop
in the market to trade sanctions were "barking up the wrong
tree."
    He said the market observers will realize this shortly.
    Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything
about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.

<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL &lt;RD> SPECIAL MEETING REQUESTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Dutch/Shell said two groups of
U.S. investors have requested a special shareholders meeting to
discuss the company's presence in South Africa.
    But it said that a special meeting could only be held under
Dutch law if 10 pct of its shareholders agree.
    Two groups of U.S. investors, it said, have less than one
pct of the outstanding shares in the company.
    The groups are seeking a special meeting to call for an end
to sales to the South African police and military, and
withdrawal from South Africa, it said.
    Royal Dutch spokesman Eric Steneker told Reuters
shareholders were entitled to discuss any matter relating to
Shell at May's annual general meeting. "In fact, Shell in South
Africa has been discussed at every meeting of shareholders for
more than 10 years," Steneker said.
    Representatives of American Baptist Churches and the New
York City Teachers Retirement System said Shell refused to
discuss their proposals at the next meeting.
    Steneker said investors had ample opportunity to express 
views and a majority supported the board's view that it should
stay in South Africa to act as a force for change.

Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with
high-level officials that will include discussions of a growing
trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.
    He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan
since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose
tariffs worth up to 30 mln dls on Japanese electronic goods on
April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up
to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.
    The trip is set for April 6-8, the state department said.

in response to a statement by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> chairman J.
Hugh Liedtke that any settlement with Texaco must be above the
two billion dlrs range.
    "We have no commment at this time. We have said in the past
that we were willing to discuss a reasonable and economic
settlement but have no comment now," a Texaco spokeswoman said
in response to a Reuter inquiry.
    Liedtke told a group of security analysts in New york, "if
anyone thinks this (litigation) could be setled in the two
billion dlrs range, they're not being realistic."
    Liedtke also told analysts Pennzoil would consider any
reasonable settlement in its ongoing 11.0-billion-dlr suit with
Texaco.
    Neither Pennzoil nor Texaco has said that any talks were
presently underway to resolve the dispute that arose when
Pennzoil charged Texaco had improperly wrested control of Getty
Corp from Pennzoil.

<TITLE>BROADER U.S. EEP SOUGHT BY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Republican members of the House
Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments
tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the
export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding
the scope of the program.
    At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would
propose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing to
purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."
    In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose
extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three
years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion
dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.
    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting
amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.
    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they
favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an
across-the-board program which they termed too costly.
    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an
amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture
Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the
market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.
    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value
accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid
hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.
    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln
dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/AMES DEPT STORES &lt;ADD></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8
to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise
announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the
fiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.
    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and
77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the
previous year.
    "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a major
Wall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most
of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its
Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.
    "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of
fraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of
Ames. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things
together."
    He said it would take several weeks for the company to
complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement
officials involved at this time.
    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in
gross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax
rate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIAL TO VISIT JAPAN AS TRADE ROW GROWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Undersecretary of State Michael
Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with
high-level officials that will include talks on the growing
trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.
    He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan
since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose
tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on
April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up
to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.
    Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
trip is set for April 6 to 8.
    U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each
year at this time, she told reporters.
    The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister
Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on
U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security
issues of mutual concern, she added.
    "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is
expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese
trade relations," she insisted.
    But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that
trade will be discussed.
   Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United
States last year has come under fire in Congress, which is
concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and
with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.

<TITLE>U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE SQUABBLE CONTINUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department said
it will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mln
dlrs the Department of Transportation, DOT, owes USDA to pay
for its share of the cost of shipping food aid on U.S. vessels.
    USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told the Senate
Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee his department had
billed DOT 12 mln dlrs, and that interest on that amount and an
additional charge would begin accruing April 1.
    USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator Thomas
Kay told Reuters DOT could owe USDA as much as 20 mln dlrs.
    The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord on
how to fund the increasing share of food aid required to be
shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision
on cargo preference.
    Sims said the agencies were near to reaching a memorandum
of understanding governing how DOT would pay for its share of
the cargo preference costs.
    Under the 1985 bill, the percentage of food aid shipments
carried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over three
years to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct.
    Although the increased cost was to be funded by DOT, Sims
said that department to date has contributed no money.

<TITLE>DUTCH MINISTER ATTACKS W. GERMAN FARM POSITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch Agriculture Minister Gerrit
Braks said today the Netherlands deeply regretted West German
opposition to radical reforms aimed at halting unwanted
European Community (EC) food production.
    Braks told journalists he had rounded on his West German
counter-part Ignaz Kiechle and accused Bonn of "lacking the
courage to tell farmers their methods were outdated" during a
private meeting of Christian Democrat politicians on Sunday.
    Braks said he told Kiechle: "You (Bonn) have had years to
put your house in order and failed to do so."
    His comments came shortly before EC ministers failed to
reach agreement at two days of talks on prices to be paid to EC
farmers from the start of the new crop year on April 1.
    The ministers agreed to roll over the present year for two
months and resume negotiations in Luxembourg next month.
    The proposals from the EC's Brussels headquarters would
slash guaranteed prices paid to producers and seek to peg farm
spending at its current two-thirds share of a total budget of
36.2 billion European Currency Units (41 billion dlrs).
    The attack from Braks comes at a time when relations
between the EC's Executive Commission, which has proposed the
reform measures, and Bonn are at an all-time low.
    The entire 17-man Commission is today visiting Bonn, once
the most enthusiastic EC member, in an attempt to overcome
differences largely resulting from bids to rein in out of
control agricultural expenditure.
    Kiechle, who yesterday denounced as totally unacceptable
new limits on producers' rights to sell unlimited amounts of
excess products into Community warehouses, warned the meeting
the measures lead to political instability in his country.
    He said they did not even form the basis of negotiation and
stressed they were opposed by all political parties in the
country.
    The issue of farm reform has been pushed to the top of the
Community's agenda by the group's protracted financial crises
and by growing international tension over farm surpluses and
subsidies.

<TITLE>SCHWAB COMPLETES PURCHASE OF SCHWAB AND CO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charles Schwab announced the
completion of the 280-mln-dlr purchase from BankAmerica Co of
Charles Schwab and Co Inc and its holding company Charles
Schwab Corp.
    The leveraged buyout is being financed by a syndicate of
seven banks led by the Security Pacific National Bank unit of
Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC>, the announcement said.
    Charles Schwab and Co is the nation's largest discount
brokerage firm.
    The Schwab announcement said BankAmerica received 175 mln
dlrs in cash, 50 mln of 10 pct senior subordinated debentures,
55 mln dlrs of nine pct junior subordinated debentures and the
right to receive 15 pct of the appreciated value of the common
equity of the new company over a maximum period of eight years.
    Security Pacific also acquired a stock appreciation right,
equal to 1.8 pct of the value of the new company's fully
diluted common stock, Schwab said.
    The right is exchangeable into warrants upon transfer to a
Security Pacific non-affiliate, Schwab said.
    BankAmerica originally acquired Schwab in 1983 for 57 mln
dlrs worth of BankAmerica common stock.
    The sale of the profitable discount brokerage firm back to
Charles Schwab was aimed at raising capital and was seen by
banking analysts as a means of heading off a hostile takeover
attempt by First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I>.

<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> OBJECT OF SHAREHOLDER CAMPAIGN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sponsors of a campaign to pressure
Royal Dutch Petroleum Co to suspend operations in South Africa
claimed the backing of church groups and other institutions who
collectively own 4.8 mln of the the company's approximately
268.0 mln shares.
    "We're seeking to have the company disinvest in South
Africa - that means get out," Harrison Goldin, comptroller of
New York City told a news conference.
    The immediate goal of the campaign is to enlist the support
of owners of 27 mln shares to force an unprecedented special
meeting of shareholders, Goldin said.
    Goldin appeared at the news conference with Gordon Smith,
treasurer of the ministers and missionaries benefit board of
the American Baptist Churches.
    The 4.8 mln shares represented by the group includes four
retirement funds covering various groups of New York City
workers, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
seven church-related groups.
    Goldin said the ultimate aim of the group is to "tighten
the noose of economic pressure on South Africa" until the
government changes its apartheid policies.
    A reprsentative of Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal
Dutch, distributed a statement after the news conference
explaining that the company supports a program of power sharing
by all South Africans.
    The statement said senior officials of the company have
stated publicly that they regard apartheid as "a system wholly
at variance with the principles on which our group of companies
has operated all over the world for many years."
    Goldin said the group seeks a special meeting because the
company has rejected efforts to have South African issues
placed on a ballot for the annual meeting in May.
    Goldin said the shareholders have no particular timetable
for the special meeting. "We are dealing with an effort to
arouse public opinion," he said, asserting that it is not
necessary to have a majority of the votes. "Large companies
respond when they see which way the wind is blowing."
    An immediate goal is to get Shell to stop selling fuel to
South Afria's military and police, he said.
    Smith said the campaign against Shell breaks new ground in
the cooperation of institutional investors on social issues. An
official of the United Mine Workers outlined a previously
announced boycott of Royal Dutch/Shell products.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury said it would expand on
May 1 its computerized program for separate trading of
registered interest and principal securities, called STRIPS, to
permit reconstituting of securities.
    Reconstitution is the term used to describe reassembling a
treasury security into a book-entry security after it has been
separated into its principal and interest components.
    In order to reconstitute a treasury security, a
deposit-taking institution will have to obtain the appropriate
principal component and all unmatured interest components, the
Treasury said.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will act as the
central processing site for reconstituting securities, the
Treasury said.
    It said reconstitution would enhance the flexibility,
liquidity and marketability of treasury securities.

<TITLE>TISCH SAYS CBS &lt;CBS> HAS GROWN STRONGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Laurence A. Tisch said CBS Inc is a
stronger company now than when he took control six months ago.
    Tisch, in a speech before the National Association of
Broadcasters, said his cost-cutting efforts have made CBS a
"better-managed company, with a stronger financial base, that
is better prepared to deal with the challenges of the future."
    Tisch has been criticized for his aggressive attempts to
slash CBS' costs, especially at the company's network news
division.
    Earlier this month he ordered up to 200 jobs trimmed from
CBS News, which he hopes will save at least 30 mln dlrs.
    In his speech, Tisch said, "While this has been an
extremely painful period at CBS and particularly for the
individuals whose jobs have been eliminated, it has been
necessary to deal with the changing economics of our business."
    He added, "We have had to establish a realistic cost
structure and assert firm control over our expenses."
    He said the cost cutting has not compromised the quality of
CBS programming or the creativity and professionalism of its
staff.
    Tisch also said he remains "firmly committed to ensuring
that our crown jewel - the CBS News Division - maintains its
position as the premier source of television news in America."

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA SETS QUEBEC PLANT MODERNIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOISBRIAND, Quebec, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors of Canada
Ltd, wholly owned by General Motors Corp, said it is planning a
450 mln Canadian dlr retooling and modernization of its
21-year-old Ste. Therese, Quebec, plant and has received 220
mln dlrs in interest-free government loans for the project.
    GM Canada said the Canadian and Quebec governments are each
providing a 110 mln dlr loan for the upgrading.
    The company said much of the investment will be used to
build a paint complex, which will make the plant competitive
with other GM plants in the U.S. and Canada.
    The 450-mln-dlr investment includes the cost of retooling
the plant to assemble front-wheel drive Chevrolet Celebrity
cars, which will be produced at Ste. Therese, beginning in May,
GM Canada said.
    "With the new paint complex and tooling, our plant will be
fully modernized to be world competitive," GM Canada president
George Peapples told a news conference.
    He said construction will begin this year on the modern
base coat/clear coat paint complex, which will provide enhanced
color standards and improved paint quality, he said.
    The Canadian government said the modernization will
guarantee continued long-term employment for about 3,500
assembly line workers at the Ste. Therese plant and for about
4,300 people employed in supply jobs in Ontario and Quebec.
    "Without our participation...we faced the prospect of
losing this plant," said Michel Cote, Canadian minister of
regional industrial expansion.
    Cote said he expected 3,100 new supplier jobs will be
created by the increased production in Ste. Therese.
    The project will transfer the company's front-wheel drive
"A" car production to Ste. Therese from Oshawa, Ontario and
will not increase the Ste Therese plant's capacity, GM Canada
said.
    It said it has produced 2.5 mln vehicles at the Ste.
Therese plant since 1965.
    The paint plant is expected to cost 200 to 250 mln dlrs and
begin operation in two years, Peapples told reporters after the
announcement.
    The retooling included in the project had been announced in
December but the company had not put a value on the retooling
costs, he said.
    Peapples estimated the interest-free loans could save GM
Canada about 60 mln dlrs at a 10 pct interest rate.
    He said the loans are repayable in full in 30 years if GM
keeps the plant open. If the company closes the plant in the
1990s, it will have to pay the federal and provincial
governments a total 75 mln dlrs of the loan by 1991.
    Peapples said GM Canada asked for the government loans
because, due to an expected overcapacity in the auto industry
in the 1990s, the company was not prepared to take the risks
involved in the investment by itself.
    GM Canada said the level of support offered by the
governments is consistent with aid provided to auto assemblers
in the U.S.
    Peapples said the company expects very strong demand in the
next decade for the type of mid-size, front wheel drive car
that will be produced at Ste. Therese.
    Cote added that GM Canada's 1985 sales of 18.5 billion dlrs
represented four pct of Canada's gross domestic product.

    Dow said it altered the increase to reflect changes in the
industry over the past month.

<TITLE>1ST CENTRAL FINANCIAL &lt;FCC> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Central Financial Corp said it
expects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it is
actively seeking an acquisition.
    The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and
chief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in an
interview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987
compared with 25 cts a year ago.
    He said, "the company currently has the sufficient momentum
to achieve those earnings and the successful completion of
licensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings."
    The company is currently licenced to operate only in New
York state.
    Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a
share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same
quarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quarter
compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to
earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of
1987.
    In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial "is
actively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers
looking for a small life insurance company to acquire."
    He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range
and will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a
"wide spectrum of insurance services." No specific company has
been targeted as yet, "but I would like to make my first
acquisition in 1987," he said.
    He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy
takeover target. It wants to remain independent, he said, and
has implemented a staggered board of directors system. In
addition, Simon, the company's biggest shareholder, holds about
960,000 of the 6.2 mln ouitstanding shares.

<TITLE>IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> IN TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon
Corp &lt;XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers
concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's
shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on
June 1, a company spokesman said.
    "From our point of view, it's a question of entering into
negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to
contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place
on June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a
query.
    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended
its oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question of
cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."
    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,
regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a
trial basis to the end of 1987.
    Under the new system, producers and refiners will be
allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered
under purchase contracts.
    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of
oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.
    "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and
we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has
been finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary
Strong said.
    Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a
reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast
demand for its refineries, Strong said.
    "We have to know what they have and how that relates to what
we need in total," he said.
    Strong said figures on the amount of crude production
Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately
available.

<TITLE>USDA AGAIN EXTENDS FARM OPERATING PLAN DEADLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department said
it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine
eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under
1987 farm programs.
    Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice
Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have
until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how
many persons would be involved in their farming operations.
    Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1
from March 1, Sitter said.
    ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that
the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at
county ASCS offices.
    Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a large
number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other
entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation
for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."
    "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the
large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs
and the Conservation Reserve Program," Hertz said.

    The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit Banner filed in

to the Central States Fund for about 20 mln dlrs in pension
withdrawal liability payments.
    Banner said the district court reserved ruling on whether
it must pay about five mln dlrs that the Central Fund claims is
owed in back-due interim payments.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> LABOR STRIFE PRECURSOR TO TOUGH TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Scott Williams, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp's relationship with
its hourly employees has turned ugly, and security analysts say
the discord forebodes tough talks this fall on a new national
labor contract at General Motors.
    General Motors' dealings with the United Auto Workers,
marred in recent months by strikes and a contract rejections,
shows few signs of improving as it tries to regain the lead
from Ford Motor Co &lt;F> as the richest U.S. auto company.
    Analysts say the automaker might have to endure a major
strike this fall before the situation is resolved.
    "There is a lot of tension between the workers and GM,"
says Michael Luckey, analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    Last week's four-day walkout by 9,000 UAW workers at
Pontiac, Mich., follows longer strikes at two General Motors
parts plants in the past year and rejection of proposed
contracts at other facilities.
    Analysts say the Pontiac strike will not be the last to hit
the company.
    Other plant strikes are likely, and chances are high that
the UAW will call a company-wide walkout against GM this fall,
says Luckey.
    "There is a good chance there will be a strike," says
Salomon Brothers analyst Jean-Claude Gruet.
    "GM is acting as if they would welcome a strike," said Ron
Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities.
    "It has been my experience the UAW strikes people they
don't like. They don't like GM," says Glantz.
    General Motors might also be faced with wildcat strikes, or
walkouts by local union units that are not endorsed by the
union's central committee, analysts said.
    General Motors will not comment on the talks, saying only
it is seeking to become a "world-class competitor."
    Elements for a tough set of labor talks are in place.
"There is a lot of pressure on both sides. (General Motors
chairman Roger) Smith is under pressure from stockholders. The
union is fighting to protect its members. Something has got to
give," Luckey says.
    The consensus on Wall Street is that General Motors will be
chosen as the "strike target", or the main company with which
it will negotiate in the fall talks to decide the next
three-year national contract.
    "You get a feeling from talking with GM that they want to
be the strike target because (they feel) Ford might capitulate
too easily," says Glantz.
    The negotiations, expected to begin in late July, will
decide the major wage, benefit and job security issues that
will cover most U.S. autoworkers. The current contract expires
September 15.
    Job security and "outsourcing", the  subcontracting of jobs
to non-UAW labor, are expected to be the main issues.
    "You're going to see a rough set of negotiations,
particularly if they can't get the outsourcing issue decided,"
says one former General Motors human relations executive.
    Some analysts point out that if the UAW decides to focus on
wages, it might pick Ford as the strike target because of
Ford's higher earnings last year.
    "You may see a situation where the UAW bargains with the
two separately," breaking its historical pattern, says Luckey.
    The number of cars building up in dealer showrooms might
indicate General Motors is preparing for a confrontation with
the union, analysts say.
    The company will have 95 days' supply of cars in dealer
showrooms at the end of March, Lucky estimates. Analysts say 50
to 65-days' supply is normal.
   General Motors wants to enter the negotiations "with enough
inventory that it won't feel a six-week strike," says Glantz.
    Some in the industry say that, despite the closing of 11
plants and indefinite layoff of 37,000 workers, further
closings and layoffs might be coming.
    A General Motors spokesman says it is "too early" to know
whether plant closures will become an issue in the talks.
    The former General Motors executive says more closures are
likely after a new UAW agreement is reached, but he adds,
"you're not going to see it before the contract," he says.
    Lucky says 10 pct of General Motors's components plants are
on the "red list" of companies likely to be shut. "It would
take a miracle for them to survive," he says.

<TITLE>GAF &lt;GAF> PLANS NO CHANGES IF OFFER ACCEPTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman told
Reuters he did not foresee major changes in Borg-Warner &lt;BOR>
if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
successful.
    "We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement," Heyman
said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers annual meeting. "We don't have any particular changes
in mind."
    Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
company.
    Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
19.9 pct.
    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
its own chemical business.
    When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
    He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
initial proposal is rejected.
    Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
    "We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
management and good for its shareholders," Heyman said.
     In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
niche products.
    He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
chemical businesses. 
    Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
years to trim balance sheets.
    He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

<TITLE>RAYTHEON &lt;RTN> GETS 3.5 BILLION DLR CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Raytheon Co has been awarded a 3.53
billion dlr military procurement contract for Patriot
air-defense missiles, the Army said.
    The contract is for five years and was awarded to the
company's Missiles Systems Division at Andover, Mass.
    The first annual increment will be for 948.8 mln dlrs for
810 missiles. The Army said that the firm will produce 4,491
missiles and 45 firing units during the life of the contract.
    The Army said that the multi-year contract would result in
savings in excess of 12 pct over the continued award of annual
contracts.
    Raytheon, in a separate release, said its Missile Systems
Division is prime contractor for the Patriot air-defense
system. Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML> is a major subcontractor
along with Raytheon's Equipment Division.
    The company also said more than 4500 vendors and
subcontrators in 34 U.S. states, the Netherlands and West
Germany are participating in the contract.
    The company said the agreement will generate cost savings
thorugh volume purchase discounts and efficient manufacturing.
"The contract will stabilize the production work forces at
Raytheon and its subcontractors," it said.
    The company said the defense system uses digital
electronics with a mulifunction phased array radar to locate
targets and control firing. It also uses launching stations for
supersonic missles.
    The weapons are designed to defend against advanced
aircraft and cruise missles. They are also being modified to
defend against tactical ballistic missles, the company said.
    West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Japan have
choosen the weapons for their air defense systems. A
co-production program with the Japanese is currently underway,
the company added.

<TITLE>FDIC OFFERS RISKED-BASED CAPITAL RULE FOR BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
proposed for comment a rule setting minimum capital
requirements for banks based on assessment of the risks of
their assets.
    The proposed rule, if adopted, would carry out a
U.S.-British agreement announced in January for a uniform
system to gauge the capital banks must maintain that accounts
for the riskiness of loans and other assets.
    The regulatory agency's staff said at a meeting the
proposal was in line with those of the Federal Reserve Board
and the Comptroller of the Currency.
    The three U.S. agencies and the Bank of England agreed in
early January on the outlines of a uniform system for capital
standards designed for the increasingly international banking
industry that operates beyond national boundaries.
    The FDIC, which regulates state-chartered banks, sought
public comment for 60 days, after which it will adopt a rule to
conform with those of the Fed and the Comptroller.
    The FDIC said the proposal rule redefines primary capital,
assigns risk weights to assets not kept on a bank's balance
sheet, and lays the groundwork for establishing a minimum
risk-based capital ratio.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. specialty steel industry
and its union said they will seek a three-year extension of
President Reagan's import restraint program to give the
industry more time to restore competitiveness.
    They said they will tell the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) Thursday that "termination will have disastrous
consequences for American companies and workers."
    The current four-year voluntary program reached with
foreign exporters ends this summer and the ITC must advise
President Reagan on the economic effect of its termination.
    The Specialty Steel Industry of the United States and the
United Steelworkers Union said in statement that imported steel
was still flooding the domestic market and continued curbs were
needed to restore the industry's health.
    Reagan is to decide by July 19 whether to renew the
restraint program.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chelsea Industries Inc said earnings for
its fiscal second quarter ended March 30 will be "sharply
lower" than the 1,414,000 dlrs or 55 cts a share it earned for
the same quarter last year.
    It also said it lowered its earnings forecasts for the
remainder of the fiscal year. In fiscal 1986, the company
earned 7,206,000 dlrs or 2.78 dlrs a share.
    The company cited intensely competitive market conditions
in its polyethelyne trash liner business and startup costs
related to its acquisition of Artisan Plastic for the reduced
earnings outlook.

downgraded 700 mln dlrs of debt of Dana Corp and its unit Dana
Credit Corp.
    Cut were the parent's senior debt and industrial revenue
bonds to A-3 from A-2. Moody's reduced to Prime-2 from Prime-1
the commercial paper of Dana and its credit unit.
    Moody's cited deterioration in capital structure and debt
protection measurements due to aggressive balance sheet
management.  Moreover, Dana's financial leverage rose to
43 pct from 22 pct in 1984 and may climb even more after
completing its ongoing stock repurchase program, Moody's said.

<DATELINE>    JACKSON, Mich., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consumers Power Co said it will
pay Union Carbide Corp 39.2 mln dlrs in settlement of a suit
that began in July 1982.
    Consumers Power said the settlement will cause it to take a
one-time loss of six mln dlrs, or seven cts a share, in its
first quarter.
    The impact will be less than the payment to Union Carbide
because Consumers Power set up a reserve to account for the
settlement, the tax effect of the settlement, and "some
book-keeping," a spokesman said.
    Union Carbide had sought 162.5 mln dlrs in damages from
Consumers Power.
    Half of the settlement will be paid immediately in cash.
The remainder will be paid in real estate.
    The dispute involved a long-term contract which Consumers
Power entered into in 1980 to buy residual fuel from Union
Carbide. In 1982 Consumers Power stopped taking oil under the
contract, claiming it was excused from buying more oil under
certain provisions of the accord.
    Union Carbide said it plans to resell the real estate,
located in northern Michigan, according to Consumers Power.

<TITLE>DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
exchange losses, the company said.
    "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
years," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
    "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairman
Macdonald said.
    "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
existence," he added.
    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
the third quarter.
    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants.
    The company said it previously determined a write down of
conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
limitation of oil and gas values.
    Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
the company from making an accurate estimate of future
financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
calculations, it said.
    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company said.
    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
contributed to the decline, it said.
    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
improvements in productivity.
    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
lower domestic and export sales, it said.
    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.
    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day
from 591.0 mcf a day.

conglomerate that had a strong turn around in 1986, said it
expects sales and earnings to climb higher this year.
    In its annual report, the company also said it expects to
maintain its current annual two dlr dividend on the basis of
continued upward earnings.
    In 1986, Avon's operational earnings rose 24 pct to 158.7
mln dlrs from 128.2 mln dlrs a year earlier, and sales rose 17
pct to 2.88 billion dlrs. It said the 2.23 dlrs a share earned
last year was the highest in five years, but still well below
the company's all-time high of 4.06 dlrs a share in 1979.

for 1987 is forecast to be about 550 mln dlrs compared to 567
mln dlrs in 1986, excluding the 1.1 billion dlrs acquisition of
Hamermill Paper Co, according to the company's annual report.
    The focus of spending will be on continued plant
modernization and maintenance.
    The company said the new federal tax law will increase its
tax burden and have a negative impact on capital investment.
    In the report, International Paper chairman John Georges
predicts the company will have modest growth and continued
improvement in its operating results due to favorable product
demand and pricing environment.
    Start-up of a 250 mln dlr coated publications paper machine
at an Arkansas mill, other mill enhancements and the Hammermill
acquisition are expected to contribute to future earnings
growth, the company said.
    For 1986, International Paper reported net income of 284.0
mln dlrs compared to 107 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TITLE>PACIFIC GAS &lt;PCG> ACCOUNTING CHANGE TO CUT NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,
reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to
change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant revenues.
    The accounting change will not affect the company's cash
position and the company intends to continue paying its
dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.
    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or
2.60 dlrs per share.
    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by
delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities
Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate
relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing
units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.
    It said the commission is currently allowing the company to
recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.
    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month
as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been
included in current income.
    But the accounting change, effective January 1, will
reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by
the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.
    It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public
Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the
5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to
recover in rates.
    The company further stated that it is confident it will
receive an objective review of the facts.
    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.
    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power
units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one
went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in
March last year.

<DATELINE>    TULSA, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Linear Films Inc said it sees lower
earnings in the fourth quarter ending March 31 compared with a
year ago due to lower profit margins on stretch film from price
increases of polyethelene resin, a key raw material.
    In last year's fourth quarter it earned 1,235,000 dlrs or
19 cts a share, a spokesman said.
    The company said it is raising its stretch film prices by
six pct as of April 15 to reflect the higher costs of
polyethelene resin. It also said sale volume of stretch film in
the fourth quarter was lower than anticipated, although it has
returned to normal in recent weeks.

auditors have qualified their opinion on the company financial
statements for 1986, in which it posted a net loss of 38.6 mln
dlrs or 1.37 dlrs a share on revenues of 31.4 mln.
    MCO said the qualfied opinion related to its realization of
the carrying amount of its geothermal property and its ability
to continue as an ongoing concern, which is dependent upon the
restructuring of the company's bank debt and other obligations,
resolution of the uncertainties surrounding its geothermal
operations and the success of future operations.
    The company said its capital spending for 1987 has been
virtually eliminated and that an additional staff reduction of
about 20 pct is being implemented today.

<TITLE>IMF SEES INDUSTRIAL NATIONS GROWING ONLY 2.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund
predicts that the industrial world will grow a sluggish 2.5 pct
in 1987, a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast six
months ago, monetary sources said.
    The forecasts, prepared by the IMF staff, will form the
basis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officials
of top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week.
    The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 2.5
pct in the U.S., shaving a full one point off its original 1987
forecast, released last fall.
    The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive board
before going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee here
next week and may be subject to slight revision, they said.
    The Reagan administration has forecast 3.2 pct U.S.
economic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officials
are predicting 2.5 to three pct.
    The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around 
2.5 pct in West Germany, and 2.8 pct in Japan.
    Washington has extracted promises from both West Germany
and Japan that they will take measures to bolster their
domestic economic growth, to help reduce the massive gap
between their huge trade surpluses and the record American
trade deficit.
    Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and the
U.S. are likely to do little to reassure currency markets.
    In recent days, the dollar has come under heavy selling
pressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo will
take early action.
    With no economic stimulus in sight, financial markets have
reduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely to
balance U.S. trade, monetary analysts say.
    Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growth
in developing nations of around three pct this year, with
developing countries in the western hemisphere -- the
Caribbean, Central and South America -- expanding 3.3 pct.
    In its recent annual report, the Inter-American Development
Bank said Latin American nations need to expand between four
and five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs of
foreign debt.
    Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve an
expansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nations
will average almost no growth at all, the sources said.
    Also short of the mark is the level of industrial country
growth. Western officials maintain the industrial world needs
to expand at least three per cent annually -- against this
year's initial IMF prediction of 2.5 pct -- in order to support
the export drive of debtor nations.
    Exports provide the indebted world, which owes western
creditors some 900 billion dlrs, with its principal source of
foreign exchange for debt repayments.
    In other forecasts, the IMF put overall global growth at
about 2.8 pct and output in the seven leading industrial
nations at around 2.5 pct.
    The seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- have become the main forum
for coordination of medium-term economic policies in the
industrial world. The prediction for the seven is also around
2.5 pct growth in 1987.
    The Fund put Canadian growth at about 2.7 pct, the French
expansion at 2.9 pct and Britain at 2.8 pct.
    The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debate
on the World Economic Outlook and the U.S. debt strategy by the
Interim Committee.
    Those talks are one of several meetings between top
economic officials of industrial and developing nations during
the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.

<TITLE>CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Leslie Adler, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The surge in currency futures since
Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed
tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the
coming week, financial analysts said.
    "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it
to last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.
    Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some
momentum today, is likely to continue, he said.
    Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the
advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,
even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the
Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6
nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his
refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note
of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.
    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner
said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of
their commitment to the Paris accord.
    "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the
scenes," Horner said.
    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will
firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.
    "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks
-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has
only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to
Horner.
    "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans
(currencies)," he said.
     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which
set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,
is at 0.007050, Horner said.
    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to
peak.
    "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said Anne
Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower."
    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a
G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price
activity the remainder of the week, Mills said.
    In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively
healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and
factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role
in coming sessions, the analysts said.
    Friday's employment statistics in particular will be
closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of
250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taco Villa Inc said it is holding talks
with RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT> to restructure its loan payments
and waive some financial convenants on its debt.
    It also said it may sell certain assets to repay the bank
borrowings, and is holding talks with interested parties. It
expects to write down some previously acquired assets, but the
company did not say by how much.
    At the end of 1986 it had 11 mln dlrs in bank debt
outstanding with a 1.7 mln dlr payment due May one. It is also
seeking to extend 1.2 mln dlrs of mortgage payments due this
year, and is in talks to extend other debt payments.
    The company said it previously reported special charges of
nine mln dlrs in the fourth quarter from losses on restaurant
closings, lease termination costs, contract settlements and
severance arrangements.
    Since it has not yet decided how to treat the additional
writedowns and debt, it has delayed its 1986 financial
statement. It said it expects to file an amendment to its form
10-K but did not say when the amended filing would be made.
    The company said it hoped to resolve its debt problems in
the near future.

<TITLE>GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. grain planting intentions and
stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a
grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.
    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
are "the first report we've had for a long time that shows any
optimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analyst
and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.
    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last
year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.
    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of
soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels
of wheat, all below trade guesses.
    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst
with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade
panel to discuss the reports.
    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five
cents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."
    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and
soybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog and
poultry production is up.
    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"
said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
15 pct in the preceding quarter.
    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
consumption.
    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.
    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's
opening," she said.
    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the
crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from
last year's 8.25 billion bushels.
    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce
stocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year
at 6.7 billion bushels.
    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
term, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
to where we could start rebuilding prices."
    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
soybeans.
    The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.
    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law
we're working under today, and this report should reinforce
that," Frazier said.
    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

<TITLE>ISRAELI PARLIAMENT PASSES NEW BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JERUSALEM, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Israel's parliament passed a 25
billion dollar state budget that lowers the taxes of highest
wage earners in an effort to stimulate worker productivity,
State Radio said.
    Israelis are one of the most heavily taxed people in the
world. Under the new budget, about a quarter of which will go
to defence, highest wage earners will pay income tax of 48 per
cent instead of the current 60 per cent.
    The bill passed less than an hour before the start of the
new fiscal year on April 1. It was held up by debates over
specific programs such as education fees and social benefits
for low wage earners.
    The radio said the budget passed by a wide majority. Last
year's budget was about 19 billion dollars.
    In January, Israel devalued its shekel currency by 9.75 per
cent against the U.S. Dollar and the government agreed to lower
taxes of high wage-earners in an effort to stimulate exports
and productivity.
    The government, trade unions and industrialists in January
also agreed to extend 18-month-old price controls until March
1988 in an effort to avert labour unrest and a return to hyper-
inflation. Because of the controls, inflation dropped to 20 per
cent in 1986 from more than 400 per cent in 1985.

<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's leading political party has
expressed full support to President Jose Sarney's decision
suspending interest payment of 68 billion dollars owed to
private foreign banks.
    Besides expressing its support, the government's Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) urged Sarney to keep on with
his decision "up to the last consequences."
    Conducted by veteran party leader Ulysses Guimaraes, head
of Brazil's Constituent Assembly, the PMDB praised Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro for his courage to propose suspension of
interest payment of the debt for an indefinite period.
    The Brazilian government announced suspension of interest
payment on part of its 109-billion dlrs foreign debt on
February 20.
    "The road to dignity has no return," said a document issued
by the PMDB.
    The party said the government's decision also had the
support of all sectors of society, including the governors of
22 Brazilian states.
    The statement said Brazil had two ways to take: "A return,
by way of submission to manoeuvres and outside pressure... Or
the way which leads the country to its independence."

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quarter-point prime rate increases to
7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
    "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
no rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
rate increase in April of that year.
    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston and Co.
    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
well foster higher interest rates soon.
    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph
Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."
    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. 
    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
increase.
    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
"may have been less a response to interest rates than an
attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."
    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
to one another could help determine how many banks match the
higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
and 6-3/4 pct.
    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>AUDITORS GIVE FIRST CITY &lt;FBT> QUALIFIED OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost
a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it
expected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeable
future" as it continues to search for additional capital or a
merger partner.
    The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received
a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.
The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City
eventually obtaining additional capital.
    "The company believes that in order to address its
long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of
operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million
dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more
strongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to its
financial statements included in the annual report.
    "Management believes that sufficient resources should be
available to cover interim capital concerns while additional
capital is being sought," the bank said.
    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell
or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions
to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of
its member banks.
    "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less
than in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter
included in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return to
satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the
successful resolution of the related problems of credit
quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial
additional capital."
    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a
credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of
First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would
be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid
default.
    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants
last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120
mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.
    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios
exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,
First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First
City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of
5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.
    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate
prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs
last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than
doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of
1986.
    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total
energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion
dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "should
be more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City's
total loans.
    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets
nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.
Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine
pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount
could go higher.
    "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate
market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio
so long as the regional recession persists," First City said.
"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is
collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of
the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of
real estate-related chargeoffs."

<TITLE>U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The complex task of wielding control
over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global
economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the
newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.
    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the
making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much
greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert
Heller, who joined the board last August.
    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but
argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were
adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the
volatility of exchange rates.
    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of
commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.
    His idea, which many conservative economists find
appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in
recent years by President Reagan.
    It would complement the present system of opening or
closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,
key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of
the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to
changes in interest rates and affect economic activity
directly.
    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept
is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary
policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid
base.
    "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can
serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary
purposes," says Heller.
    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States
went off the gold standard because the global economy had
vastly outstripped gold supplies.
    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of
hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest
producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.
    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early
1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.
    But the current system of floating currencies in which
currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the
monetary system, is also being widely questioned.
    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a
formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when
currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are
major problems with this also.
    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries
might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be
detrimental to their own domestic economy.
    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can
make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree
with the fundamental judgement.
    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference
to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them
cope with their overpowering debt problems.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's
chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called
Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a
forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other
economic matters.
   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,
France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind
closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public
posturing.
   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a
profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and
international exchange rates.
    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major
commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together
and prices would be measured on a regular basis.
    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary
policy might be eased," he says.
    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction
markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a
virtually continuous basis.
    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and
traded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevance
for the entire world," he says.
    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the
production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all
production processes.
    "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive
indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,
the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in
making their monetary policy decisions," he says.
    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity
such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by
the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.
    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow
monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity
to the rest of the system and to other commodities.

<TITLE>EMERY AIR &lt;EAF> TO BID FOR PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WILTON, Conn., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emery Air Freight Corp said it
plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
    The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
Purolator share outstanding.
    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
management-led buyout offer.
    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
tender offer of its own.
    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
April 28, unless extended.
    The company said conditions of the offer include the
receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
share purchase rights plan.
    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
the tender offer.
    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
payable twice a year.
    For the first three years after the notes are issued,
interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
additional notes, Emery said.
    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
for one year after they are issued.
    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
management would continue with the company.
    "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
of the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.
    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
the stock market had closed.
    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.
    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.

<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian farmers, angry about high
interest rates, staged fresh protests yesterday in the southern
state of Rio Grande do Sul and three people died when a lorry
careered into one of the farmers' roadblocks, police said.
    A series of protests involving hundreds of thousands of
farmers has disrupted rural towns since January as the growers
blockade roads and bank offices with farm machinery.
    The Estado de Sao Paulo news agency said about 300,000 of
the 500,000 small farmers in Rio Grande do Sul took part in
yesterday's protests. The state is a leading producer of grains
and soybeans.
    The Estado de Sao Paulo agency quoted Finance Minister
Dilson Funaro as saying the government was very concerned about
the farmers' situation and particularly about their credit
problems.
    The government provides limited cheap credits at 10 pct
annual interest, but farmers are repaying bank loans at more
than 400 pct since the recent surge in inflation.
    Brazilian press reports say financial pressures have driven
some farmers to suicide in recent weeks.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FENGBANG COUNTY, China, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>"If we go on using up
farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
20 years to grow grain on."
    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
but only one seventh of its land is arable.
    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
1986.
    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
the two years.
    "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
industrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearly
all the families in the county have built new homes and many
factories have gone up."
    "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. But
land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
already have new houses, she added.
    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
for the first time this year.
    "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," said
an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
    "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," it
said. "China has a large population and its land resources are
badly deficient."
    An official of the Shanghai city government said county
authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
be approved by the city government.
   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
much to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise city
grain prices without any problem.
    But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising the
price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
stability," said a China Daily editorial this month.
    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
long term. "We must be very careful. We have a very large
population which is used to price stability and will object to
price rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it."
    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
grain and consumed by city residents.
    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
    "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at
the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the
future," the China Daily said in an editorial last month.
    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to
use the land but not own it. For most of the period of
Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where
there was little room for individual initiative.
    "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency
of government policies and make them interested in long-term
investment," the newspaper said.

<TITLE>CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The grain output of a major Chinese
grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers
lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage
facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in
grain, the province's vice-governor said.
    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,
as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as
they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash
crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct
of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment
had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.
    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct
of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.
    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was
hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a
further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.
    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt
with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more
investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use
of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the
tendency to rely on grain imports.
    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to
the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said
the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four
pct from 11 pct.
    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few
years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention
to grain and cotton production," he said.
    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be
self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the
northeast, but it imports wheat.
    "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach
the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered
adequate," Tian said.

<TITLE>REAGAN SETS FIRM RULES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan made public a
detailed set of orders to his national security staff designed
to prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.
    In a message to Congress accompanying National Security
Decision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: "(The reforms) are
evidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,
including consultation with the Congress."
    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was the
first time the duties of the national security staff had been
spelled out in such a document since the National Security
Council (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.
    The orders implement the recommendations of the Tower
Commission, named by the president to investigate the secret
U.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.
    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted the
conduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for being
unaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.
    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech on
March 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covert
operations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which calls
for a "small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experienced
in the making of national security policy."
    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose "clear vertical
lines of control and accountability."
    The eight page document said the NSC's use of private
individuals and organisations as intermediaries to conduct
covert activities would be "appropriately limited and subject to
close observation."
    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser who
would have access to all information. The national security
adviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies and
operations and ensure that consultations and presidential
decisions are adequately recorded, it said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN'S SECOND QUARTER IMPORTS SEEN RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of
1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82
billion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the first
quarter of this year, the statistics department said.
    A department official attributed the increase to growing
domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is
expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a
year earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.
    Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to
rise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year
earlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.
    The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to
climb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987
from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the
first quarter of this year.
    Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the
U.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly
50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.
    He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains,
machinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise
sharply because of government efforts to balance trade with
Washington. He declined to give figures.

<TITLE>COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present
viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be
lower than in 1986.
    In the first two months of the year, partial operating
profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -
declined, he said, without giving details.
    The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of
1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the
quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.
By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.
    German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp
said last year the figure for the first time had topped one
billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was
around 50 pct higher than this.
    Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the
full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of
1985 because own account profits increased slightly."
    He gave no concrete details but added that in January and
February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop
in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the
partial operating figure.
    The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in
future, developing, for example, more into investment banking,
keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening
expenditures on fixed assets.
    Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had
been a strong growth in business volume.
    Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2
billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.
    Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15
billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher
still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.
    In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in
the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56
pct despite pressure on credit rates.
    The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a
quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost
exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.
    Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more
than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct
to more than 650 mln.
    As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose
by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.
    Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year
from 233 mln in 1985.
    Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high
two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG
&lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's
majority stake purchase booked last year.
    The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in
credit business against profits from securities trading and
earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior
years, to its full extent.
    Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the
largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual
write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of
problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of
credit exposure to provisions improved further.
    Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to
problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into
dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.
    "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer
on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual
default," he added.
    Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the
last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is
better armed than it was against payment problems.
    All banks had significantly strengthened their capital
base, most European banks had made considerable provisions
against bad debts while goverments and central banks were
better prepared for unforseen difficulties.
    He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new
approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of
interest in direct investment via an equity participation in
Latin America, particularly from West German firms.

<TITLE>SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank should take further
steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from
further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring
long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said.
    But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not
mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in
money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down
for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.
    "Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates," he said.
"The money market rates are the important ones."
    Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating
money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent
tender allocations.
    An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of
credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary
growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of
the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital
formation, braking the expansion of money supply.
    "Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of
monetary growth both at the same time," he added.
    Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a
picture of the German economy, since company profitability had
improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were
profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.
    Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,
describing the downturn in production in the first months as a
false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.
    After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the
economy should show an uptrend in the last three. "We don't
believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a
'growth dip,'" Seipp said.
    But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal
policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should
be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.
    The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January
were no substitute for support for growth.
    Seipp added the federal government should make "further
courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the
German economy and to increase its flexibility."

<TITLE>COMMERZBANK TO FOUND NEW YORK INVESTMENT BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said he hoped the bank would this
year found a 100 pct investment bank subsidiary in New York.
    He told the annual news conference that the move would be
an important and necessary widening of business activities in
the U.S.. This is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake in
EuroPartners Securities Corp, New York, owned along with other
European banks in a consortium.
    It would also be a further step in Commerzbank's full entry
into global investment banking around the clock.
    Seipp also said securities trading activities had been
considerably strengthened in London. The founding of Commerz
Securities (Japan) Co. Ltd, which would begin business in the
first half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in Tokyo.
    In 1987 also, Commerzbank planned to open a representative
office in Istanbul. Currency trading had begun in the Los
Angeles branch, he added.
    At home, Commerzbank would probably bring the automotive
supply group Boge and clothing manufacturer Ahlers to a stock
exchange flotation in the first half of this year.
    But the placement of shares in the print communications
technology group &lt;Linotype GmbH>, to be bought from Allied
Signal Inc &lt;ALD.N> would likely come later since several parts
of the business had to be consolidated first.
    Seipp said the purchase price had been "several hundred
million dollars." But he gave no further details.

<TITLE>HAWKE DECIDES AGAINST EARLY AUSTRALIAN ELECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Bob Hawke has decided
against an early election despite a leadership crisis in the
opposition coalition, Australian government officials said.
    They said Hawke made the decision after meeting senior
advisers and high-ranking members of the ruling Labour Party in
Canberra last night.
    An expected improvement in the economy predicted by an
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report
was a major factor in Hawke's deciding against calling an
election now, they said.
    The officials picked March 5 next year as the most likely
election date, which would allow the government to complete its
full five-year term of office and ensure that Hawke becomes the
longest-serving Labour Prime Minister in Australian history.
    Hawke, however, has not withdrawn his earlier threat to
consider dissolving both houses of parliament if the opposition
National-Liberal Party coalition blocked legislation to
introduce identity cards for Australians.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai stocks have broken all expectations
and brokers and securities analysts said the nine-month bull
market on the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) should last
through 1987.
    Most had earlier dismissed a forecast by a local newspaper
last December that the SET Index would rise 50 points to 250 by
mid-1987. They said the figure is now within easy reach.
    The index, an average of the 93 registered stocks listed on
the market, gained 9.7 pct this month to finish the first
quarter at 228.97.
    The index has gained 74 pct since last July after declines
of two pct in the first half of 1986 and five pct in 1985.
    Yothin Aree, assistant managing director of Bangkok First
Investment and Trust Ltd (BFIT) echoed most analysts in saying
that, barring dramatic increases in oil prices and world
interest rates, the market will sustain its rally for the rest
of the year, punctuated by periodic corrections.
    Securities analysts said stocks are the best investment
because of excess liquidity, which has forced interest rates to
10-year lows. Bankers expect deposit rates, which have fallen
six times since January 1986, to stabilise this year.
    Central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul told commercial
banks last week they should spur loan demand by cutting lending
rates without a matching reduction in deposit rates.
    SET statistics show daily trading in listed corporate
stocks and government bonds averaged 217 mln baht during the
first quarter, about 4.5 times higher than a year ago.
    Robert Chan, deputy managing director of Wardley Thailand
Ltd, said foreign interest in Thai equities is strong and a few
Japanese fund managers recently approached him for the first
time to seek advice on investing in the market.
    Wardley Thailand, affiliated with The Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp, handles stocks acquired by many foreign fund
managers investing in SET.
    "We thought six months ago that Thai stocks might have been
overpriced after a significant 23.5 pct rise of the SET Index
during the third quarter," Chan said, adding it has since gained
41 pct.
    He forecast the index could advance 30 to 40 points more by
year-end given the improving Thai economy, foreign interest in
Thai stocks and SET's average 12 pct price/earnings ratio,
which is relatively low by world standards.
    Foreign investment accounted for 1.22 billion baht, or 7.8
pct of total turnover, in the January/February period, up from
347 mln baht, or 5.8 pct, for the whole first quarter of 1986.
    Foreigners can invest in the market directly, or through
the Bangkok Fund or Thailand Fund, unit trusts set up as a
portfolio investment vehicles for foreigners.
    Bangkok Fund was set up by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
and Cazenove and Co in 1985, while the Thailand Fund was set up
last December by Vickers da Costa International Ltd, Morgan
Stanley and Co Inc, Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, BIL
(Asia) Ltd and the World Bank's International Finance Corp.
    Each trust is capitalised at 30 mln dlrs and has invested
more than 70 pct of its funds in equities.
    Brokers said demand for Thai stocks has strengthened
criticism the market, with 2.9 billion dlrs capitalisation, is
too small and its trading narrowly based.
    Although an average 50 issues are now traded a session,
against 30 a year ago, most foreign fund managers focus on less
than 10 easily tradeable blue chips. Yothin said investors do
not seem interested in smaller or speculative issues.
    Long-term investment in SET is also restricted by laws
limiting foreign-held equity in most listed companies.
    Foreign equity is limited to a maximum 25 pct in banks and
is also the self-imposed limit in popular Siam Cement. Most
other businesses have a 49 pct limit.
    SET officials said foreign investment in blue chips has
reached a limit and the barrier will likely slow investment as
fund managers are reluctant to buy smaller issues.
    SET President Maruay Phadungsith said his priority is to
list more stocks this year and is waiting for government
approval to launch a second trading board, where less
diversified companies with short track records can be listed.
    SET hopes to list 10 new issues this year against only one
in 1986.
    SET officials added state enterprises that have delayed
plans to go public are missing a golden opportunity to attract
capital through the exchange as their shares would be popular.
    A plan for state-owned Thai Airways International Ltd and
Bangchak Petroleum Co Ltd to go public this year appears less
certain because of opposition from their administrations.
    The privatisation of Krung Thai Bank Ltd has also been put
in doubt by a Finance Ministry decision this month to merge it
with ailing government-owned Sayam Bank Ltd.

<TITLE>H.K. INVESTORS UNLOAD HOLDINGS AFTER STOCK ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Joshua So, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investors are unloading holdings of
Hong Kong stocks following a spate of new share issues by
leading local firms, analysts said.
    The Hang Seng index fell 61.07 to 2,713.81 yesterday on
speculation that Hutchison Whampoa Ltd planned a bonus issue of
new "B" shares.
    After yesterday's market close Hutchison and its parent
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd both announced one-for-two bonus
issues of "B" shares. The news sent the index down 63.51 points
to 2,650.30 in today's morning session.
    The Cheung Kong companies' issues  followed Jardine
Matheson Holdings Ltd's announcement on Friday of a
four-for-one bonus issue of new "B" shares.
    There is also market speculation that Evergo Industrial
Enterprise Ltd will make a similar move, following a request
for suspension in share trading by the firm today.
    Analysts said these new issues will have an adverse impact
on trading.
    James Miller-Day, director of County Securities Asia Ltd,
said: "I don't like the concept of "B" shares because it will
create inequality among equities."
    He said the issue of "B" shares could create a conflict of
interest with holders of other classes of shares, noting most "B"
shares are issued at a par value equivalent to one-tenth of the
"A" shares, but enjoy similar voting rights.
    Other analysts said the new issues also renewed concern
over local corporate attitudes towards political changes in
Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to China in 1997.
    Controlling shareholders can maintain control of local
firms by issuing cheaper shares, with much of the new stock
being distributed to themselves, analysts said.
    Those shareholders can reduce their investment exposure
here by selling some of their "A" shares and using the funds for
new investment, possibly overseas.
    An analyst at a major brokerage house said Li Ka-shing,
chairman of both Cheung Kong and Hutchison, might be planning
to fund future expansion by switching "A" shares for "B" shares.
    Other analysts noted that the Cheung Kong group has already
taken a major stake in Husky Oil Ltd of Canada and a minority
share in Pearson Plc of Britain.
    Hutchison has begun a major project to expand berthing
facilities at its Hong Kong International Terminal Ltd and
Cheung Kong will bid for a big land reclamation development at
Hong Kong harbour.
    The analysts said timing of the new issues was wrong
because the local market had already been hit by declines on
Wall Street and London since the beginning of the week.
    "(The issues) came at a time when world stock markets are
reeling from tensions between the U.S. And Japan over their
trade relations," said Barry Yates, director of Hoare Govett
Asia Ltd.    Jardine Matheson's shares enjoyed a brief rally after the
announcement of the new issue, though they have lost 2.50 H.K.
Dlrs since last Friday to stand at 22.30 dlrs today.
    Cheung Kong was down two dlrs from yesterday's close at
41.25 dlrs and Hutchison fell 3.25 dlrs to 49.75 dlrs.

    He told reporters the major currency nations are determined

    Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as

<TITLE>H.K. STOCK EXCHANGE BARS NEW 'B' SHARE ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hong Kong Stock Exchange said it
will not accept further proposals by listed firms to issue new
shares with reduced par value but equal voting rights.
    It said in a statement the exchange will review the
previously announced proposals of bonus issues of "B" shares by
Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd &lt;JARD.HK>, Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK> and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>.
    It added the exchange's Listing Committee will meet later
today to consider these proposals.
    The Exchange statement said: "Any such proposals (other than
the three) will not be considered until a general principle has
been established by the Stock Exchange after consultation with
the Securities Commission."
    An official of the Securities Commissioner's office told
Reuters the decision to bar the new share issues was made by
the Exchange, adding the Commissioner is closely watching
developments.
    The Hong Kong market fell sharply yesterday and today as
both Cheung Kong and Hutchison announced a one-for-two bonus
issue of "B" shares.
    The Cheung Kong companies' move followed Friday's
announcement by Jardine Matheson of a four-for-one bonus issue
of similar "B" shares with a reduced par value and equal voting
rights.
    Brokers also noted market speculation that &lt;Evergo
Industrial Enterprise Ltd> will make a similar move after the
firm requested to suspend share trading this morning. Evergo
officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Analysts said controlling shareholders might use the "B"
shares to retain corporate control while selling some of their
existing holdings to finance new investments.

told reporters in Canberra: "I am confident that Labour would
win an early election. I have decided, however, that the
election will be held towards the end of this year or early
next year.

    A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just under
three pct for 1986-1990.
    The 1987 report said gross national product would only
expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations
-- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later,
however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the
five-year period.

blocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc &lt;DAL.N>
and &lt;Western Airlines> just hours before it was to go into
effect because of a dispute over union representation.
    The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport
Employees union said Western's management should fulfil a
promise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials
could not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the
merger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
forecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the money
market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for
repurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg while
bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury
bills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. A rise in note
circulation will take out a further 105 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers' balances above
target some 185 mln stg.

estimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with
5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said.
    Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic
Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier
estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth
both at 7.9 pct.
    The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct,
the same level it had set for 1986.
    The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6
dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.
    Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in
domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled
municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.
    Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared
with 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Stock
 Exchange Ltd (ASX)
today took up the responsibility for administering a new
coordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,
now operating as subsidiary trading floors.
    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and
non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of
Australia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers
exposed to greater deregulation.
    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover
to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.
    Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> was one of the first to take
advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double
its stake in the Sydney firm &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.
    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over
the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end
restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships
to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside
institutions, and eventually to full ownership.
    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and
offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger
stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.
    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now
acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from
non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.
    "Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital
and a broader base of products," ASX chairman Ian Roach told
Reuters.
    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose
a restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamic
sharebroking industry were unfounded.
    "So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of
preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.
    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that
the expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners to
their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a
massive talent drain.
    Several leading brokers have already announced plans to
leave their firms and establish new private client businesses,
while others plan public floats.
    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking
during Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they
could find themselves without the expertise they need during
more difficult times, some brokers said.
    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house &lt;Rivkin James
Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that
restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and
this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.
    "If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone into
broking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these golden
handcuffs come to an end?" Rivkin said.
    "Only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.
    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> unit &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a
public float of between 25 and 30 pct.
    "My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They
leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if
we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but
that hasn't happened," he said.
    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could
find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull
market ends.
    In the last two years, the value of the Australian
sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to
31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.
    That growth put existing trading systems and clearing
houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign
exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based
trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.
    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a
pilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on
its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors
over the next four years, industry sources said.

<TITLE>MALAYSIAN MINERS SAY U.S. SELLING TOO MUCH TIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian miners criticised the
U.S. For violating an agreement with Southeast Asian producers
by selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.
    The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes
of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000
tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.
    In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised
to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed
with the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in December 1983.
    "The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN
Memorandum of Understanding," the Chamber said.
    The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held
180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes in
excess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.
    The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia and
Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin.

<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The balance sheet total of all
Luxembourg-based banks fell in January to 7,888 billion
luxembourg francs, a decline of 1.49 pct on the previous month,
the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois (IML) said.
    The IML, Luxembourg's monetary authority, said this was
partly due to the seasonal decline following the closure of
bank accounts in December and partly to the dollar's fall.
    But the end-January total represented a 5.10 pct rise on
end-January 1986, the IML said.
    The balance sheet total was also affected by currency
fluctuations, and allowing for this, the January total
represented a 0.3 pct rise on the previous month and a 13.6 pct
rise on January 1986, the IML said.
    There were 123 banks in Luxembourg at the end of January, a
rise of one on the month before and of five on January 1986,
the IML said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd>,
a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said it planned to
enter the U.K. Business facsimile and key telephone market, and
forecast a turnover of 100 mln stg by 1990 for its full range
of office automation equipment.
    The announcement comes in the middle of a dispute between
the U.K. And Japan over the entry of Cable and Wireless Plc
&lt;CAWL.L> into the Japanese market.
    Toshiba said the introduction of the products indicated its
commitment to the U.K. Although the market was competitive, the
facsimile segement was showing excellent growth.
    In Japan, Cable is battling against proposals to merge a
consortium in which it has a 20 pct stake with another group
seeking telecommunications contracts.
    Initial proposals would have given Cable a three pct stake.
A later suggestion increased this to five pct, but Cable said
yesterday the idea was still unacceptable.  The dispute is
being treated by the U.K. Government as a test case of the
openness of the Japanese telecommunications market.
    Analysts said the coincidence of the timing of the
announcement by Toshiba with Cable's dispute could increase
pressure from the U.K. On Japan.
    However, they noted that it was not a major move. Toshiba
already has a sizeable presence in the U.K. While other
Japanese companies, such as NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> has a presence in
the key telephone -- telephone systems for businesses --
market.
    Cable shares were quoted seven pence lower in morning
trading at 367p.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is
expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986
because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the
rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,
industry sources said.
    Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344
vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),
up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan
Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told
Reuters.
    China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while
South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.
    Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading
shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "We
expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected
decline in our steel product exports."
    Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in
scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the
U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.
    Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel
product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half
of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a
Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.
    Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel
exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.
    The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against
the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and
economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by
the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.
    In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan
remained stable during the same period, he added.
    "We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China
because foreign importers have switched their purchases," he
said.
    Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast
Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987
from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and
Iron Association official said.
    He said he expected further declines in later months but
did not give figures.

<TITLE>H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
yesterday, dealers said.
    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks.
    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2
pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on
January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,
with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against
yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,
fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of
increased liquidity for a local stock issue.

<TITLE>GERMAN CALL MONEY DROPS BACK AT MONTH START</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Call money rates fell to 3.85/95 pct
from five pct yesterday in moderate trading as month end
tightness disappeared and operators took positions for April.
    Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to
four pct range this month. A minor tax payment period on behalf
of customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension
payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.
    Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system
on the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said
they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with
a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.
    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seipp
called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect
the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities
repurchase agreements down.
    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit
policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign
pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.
    Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively
drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to
achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers
said.
    Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7
billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the
first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one
day before the end of the month.
    Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks.
    Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency
funding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to
draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet
Bundesbank needs, the data showed.

<TITLE>TURKISH BANKS ANNOUNCE HIGHER PROFITS FOR 1986</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ragip Erten, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ISTANBUL, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey's banks are reporting a strong
recovery in 1986 profits, but a government drive to liberalise
capital markets poses new challenges to a banking industry
seeking to broaden its earnings base.
    A dozen of Turkey's 55 banks have announced higher 1986
profits so far, a trend bankers in the financial capital of
Istanbul expect to be reflected through most of the industry.
    But while Ankara's policy of liberalising markets offers
new opportunites to expand operations, some bankers see dangers
attached to a related drive to push down Turkish interest
rates.
    Bankers said the government's policy of fostering lower
interest rates could lead to a consumer boom and reignite
inflation, currently running at about 30 pct. They worry that
this could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit
base.
    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build up
their capital market operations as Turkey's market-oriented
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.
    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly
from foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But a
growing volume of trading in government securities is now also
a major source of revenue for banks.
    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from
the traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,
and some have even been making a loss on these operations.
    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980
when the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in
50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an
inflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.
    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the
Bosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to
pay depositors real interest rates for the first time and
profits started to fall. Previously, rates had been below
inflation.
    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the
export drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reaped
the benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. The
number of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.
    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exports
declined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985
and bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.
    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have
started moving into capital market operations to broaden their
earnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a
year ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
    "When we saw that there was a demand and supply of money
outside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves
excluded from these transactions," said Osman Erk, deputy
general manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.
    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading
government securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the
market was revived in December 1985.
    Liberalisation went one step further last week when
parliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.
Last month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's first
commercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.
    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strong
recovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603
mln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to
30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. Bankers said both benefited
from trade finance and increased capital market operations.
    Turkey's second biggest bank, the private Turkiye Is
Bankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3
billion in 1985.
    However, bankers said some banks have been "window dressing"
their balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which are
variously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of the
industry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.
    Non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s as
industry failed to cope with higher interest rates and started
to default. Some banks continued to count loans as performing.
    "After 1984 all banks started to be more careful in giving
credits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the period
between 1980 to 1984," Erk said.
    But the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three state
banks of medium-sized Turkiye Ogretmenler Bankasi AS earlier
this year when the Treasury, which acts as a watchdog body over
banks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extent
made up of non-performing loans.
    Some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loan
portfolio was non-performing. But the bank had reported a 1986
pre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.
    Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance
sheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank
to standardise accounting.
    Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory
auditing by international accounting companies.

<TITLE>GLAVERBEL SHARE OFFER OVER 100 TIMES OVERSUBSCRIBED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The public offer by Glaverbel SA,
Europe's third biggest glassmaker, of 755,000 shares was more
than 100 times oversubscribed, a statement by banks and share
dealers responsible for the issue said.
    Glaverbel offered the shares at 1,850 francs in an
operation under which its parent company, Asahi Glass Ltd
&lt;ASGL.T> will reduce its participation to 56.7 pct from 73.6
pct previously.
    Asahi is selling 500,000 shares in Glaverbel while the
company itself is issuing 340,000 new shares. Over 10 pct of
the total available shares has been reserved for staff.
    The statement said applicants for over 5,000 shares will
receive 30. There is a sliding scale which gives relatively
modest applications a higher proportion and those who sought
between 101 and 500 shares will receive five. No shares will be
given to applicants for fewer than 100 shares.
    Glaverbel's net consolidated profit rose to 542 mln francs
last year from 137 mln in 1985 and the group is to pay a 29
franc gross dividend, its first for over 10 years.
    As a result of the offer, some 45 pct of Glaverbel's
capital, or two mln shares, will be listed on the Brussels
bourse.
    Share dealers said some of the weakness on the bourse
recently probably has been due to the amount of money tied up
in Glaverbel applications.

<TITLE>SUGAR TRADERS FORECAST LIKELY EC SUGAR REBATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>London traders say the European Community
is likely to award a maximum rebate of 46.80 European currency
units per 100 kilos at today's tender, while traders in Paris
predict a maximum award of 46.40 Ecus.
    Last week the EC awarded licences for 59,000 tonnes at a
rebate of 45.678 Ecus.
    Trade views differed on the amount of sugar likely to be
released today.
    London traders said the EC Commission will probably
endeavour to release a large tonnage, and as much as  100,000
tonnes may be authorised for export under licences up to
end-September.
    Paris traders put the likely tonnage at around 60,000.

<TITLE>BUEHRMANN-TETTERODE PLANS FURTHER EXPANSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, APRIL 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch paper, packaging and graphical
equipment group Buehrmann-Tetterode NV &lt;BVTN.AS> said its
policy in this and coming years will be aimed at further
expansion by autonomous growth and takeovers at home and
abroad.
    In the statement on its official results for 1986 it also
confirmed provisional results given on March 2, stating a 1986
net profit of 93.2 mln guilders against 57.3 mln in 1985.
Turnover rose by 4.4 pct to 3.25 billon guilders.
    Net profit per share, corrected for a share issue and stock
split, was 3.92 guilders in 1986 against 3.28, and dividend
1.55 guilders per nominal five guilder share against 1.30
guilders.
    Buehrmann-Tetterode said its international expansion will
be aimed at the United States in particular, adding that the
company was pursuing wider geographical spread of assets and
profits.
    Joint-ventures might in some cases be preferable to
starting new activities on their own, the statement said.
    The firm said its financial position enables it to achieve
its goals and it has confidence for 1987.
    Buehrmann's board chairman, Adriaan Overwater, told
reporters he expected 1987 turnover to grow more rapidly than
in 1986 when net sales posted only a 4.4 pct rise to 3.4
billion guilders while profits were up 63 pct to 93.2 mln.
    He said 1986 profits surged mainly after acquisitions and
reorganisations aimed at reducing costs and solving operational
problems, such as unsatisfactory management in the firm's
stationary, office equipment and leisure articles division.
    Overwater said he was optimistic about 1987 prospects but
said he would await first quarter results before quantifying
growth expectations.

Boliden AB &lt;BLDS ST> said it would buy the mining equipment
operations of the U.S. Allis-Chalmers Corp &lt;AH.O>, amounting to
more than 50 pct of group sales, for 600 mln crowns.
    Boliden president Kjell Nilsson told a news conference the
acquisition of the Allis-Chalmers unit, which he described as
the world's leading producer of equipment for the mineral
processing industry, would yield positive synergy effects for
Boliden mining, metals and engineering operations.
    Nilsson said the takeover also will provide opportunities
to cooperate with the mining and materials handling operations
of Boliden's parent company, &lt;Trelleborg AB>.
    He said Allis-Chalmers was selling out because it needed
new cash after suffering big losses in its farm equipment
operation.
    The deal is subject to approval by Allis-Chalmers' annual
meeting, company officials said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposed sales tax on gold transactions
could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of
trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and
Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press
conference.
    "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,
Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"
he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would
be unable to compete in the international market, he added.
    "How can the government really raise taxes if the system
they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.
    The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades
exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen
tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.
    The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading
more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,
gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as
that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.
    However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and
coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.
    Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold
turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.
    A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early
1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks
fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.
    Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the
volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.
    While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the
volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London
and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.
    Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average
just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.
    Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the
government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to
commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers
said.
    Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese
trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign
participant.
    Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one
and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while
futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers
said.
    "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo
market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three
major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal
opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper
on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"
Hofer said.
    "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an
internationalising market," he added.
    Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,
attending the press conference, said they supported Credit
Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Indian Finance Ministry's
announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's
interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture
by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.
    The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial
bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct
by one percentage point.
    New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also
include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on
deposits of two years or more but less than five.
    Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
interest have been abolished.
    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing
of 1,012.50 rupees.
    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the
Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5
pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.
    "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks
pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said.

<TITLE>PRECIOUS METALS CLIMATE IMPROVING, SAYS MONTAGU</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The climate for precious metals is
improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears
and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,
brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.
    Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due
to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative
to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In
March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.
    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,
and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is
modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.
    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to
continue in the short term.
    A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices
attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as
the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver
was positive.
    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the
other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lightning strikes hit the grain sector
of the port of Rotterdam today after employers turned down
union demands for shorter working hours in a new labour
agreement, transport union FNV spokesman Bert Duim said.
    Around 140 grain handlers stopped work, 125 of them at the
two Europoort locations of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which
handles about 95 pct of grain, oilseeds and derivatives passing
through Rotterdam.
    GEM managing director Pieter van der Vorm said the
facilities were 40 pct operational.
    The employers had invited the unions for talks later today,
but details of the labour agreement would not be on the agenda,
Van der Vorm said.
    It is barely one month since the end of an eight-week
campaign of lightning strikes against redundancies in
Rotterdam's general cargo sector, which stevedoring companies
said cost them millions of guilders.

the U.S. Allis-Chalmers Corp, amounting to more than 50 pct of
group sales, for 600 mln crowns.
    Boliden president Kjell Nilsson told a news conference the
acquisition of the Allis-Chalmers unit, which he described as
the world's leading producer of equipment for the mineral
processing industry, would yield positive synergy effects for
Boliden mining, metals and engineering operations.
    Nilsson said the takeover will provide opportunities to
cooperate with the mining and materials handling operations of
Boliden's parent company, Trelleborg AB.
    He said Allis-Chalmers was selling out because it needed
new cash after suffering big losses in its farm equipment
operation.
    The deal is subject to approval by Allis-Chalmers' annual
meeting, company officials said.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rajan Moses, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Government officials in Malaysia, a
major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join
the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock
rules were agreed in London last week.
    Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January
the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so
far a decision has not been announced. The government is said
to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers
and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because
certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.
    Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The
government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock
mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is
labouring under surpluses, officials said.
    But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's
participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for
exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.
    They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at
current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it
because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially
estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.
    Most growers and traders added they are also against a
buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires
withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.
    Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,
might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30
mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this
might affect their economic viability, they said.
    "The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it
will be a real messy business for the government and the trade
if it ever occurs," an industry source said.
    The growers and traders also said that under new buffer
stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not
a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also
allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.
    Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as
Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.
    Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to
join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need
not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries
to join the agreement even at a later date.

    He told reporters the major currency nations are determined

February 22 currency stability agreement in Paris.
    Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as
anything like a free-fall.

1986/1987 fiscal year has been revised to 3.7 billion H.K. Dlrs
from a 3.1 billion dlr estimate made in February, Financial
Secretary Piers Jacobs said.
    He told the Legislative Council that the revision for the
year ended March 31, 1987 reflected higher than anticipated
stamp tax revenues due to an active stock market.
    The surplus for the fiscal year was initially estimated at
348 mln dlrs and was revised to 3.1 billion in Jacobs' budget
presentation in February. The 1987/1988 budget surplus is
estimated at 1.8 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a
one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks
yesterday, dealers said.
    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks.
    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said
prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2
pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on
January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,
with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against
yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,
fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of
increased liquidity for a local stock issue.

special status as international banking centres, Ontario's

    He told journalists that little concrete activity had taken

cities would gain a special status, while Toronto, despite its
position as Canada's main financial centre, would not.
    "They (the federal government) have sent a confusing signal
to world financial markets," Kwinter said. "It was done for
political reasons and it's going to backfire on them."

<TITLE>PRECIOUS METALS CLIMATE IMPROVING, SAYS MONTAGU</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The climate for precious metals is
improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears
and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,
brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.
    Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due
to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative
to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In
March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.
    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,
and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is
modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.
    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to
continue in the short term.
    A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices
attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as
the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver
was positive.
    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the
other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.

<AUTHOR>    By Per Isaksson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish mining and metals group
Boliden AB &lt;BLDS.ST> said the takeover of the U.S.
Allis-Chalmers Corp's &lt;AH.O> mining machinery division made it
the world's leading maker of such equipment.
    President Kjell Nilsson, announcing the 600 mln crown deal,
told a news conference Boliden would now become a truly
international concern with operations in Brazil, Chile and
other big minerals-producing nations.
    He said the Allis-Chalmers' division, accounting for some
50 pct of the U.S. Group's sales, would fit in well into
Boliden.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The prospect that other banks will
follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising
their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit
markets today, economists said.
    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
news.
    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
    "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the
banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I
wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," said
Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

<TITLE>U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines
Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said.
    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
had been settled by arbitration.
    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
to go through as planned later today.
    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
    "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,"
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
last night. "There was really very little that remained to be
done."
    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
Delta outfits.
    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
represent Western employees after the integration of the two
airlines.
    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
"extinguished" after today.

<TITLE>THIRD MARINE ARRESTED; U.S. PRESSES SPY PROBE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A second U.S. Marine has been charged
with spying and a third arrested on suspicion of lying about
contacts with Soviet women in a growing scandal involving the
American Embassy in Moscow.
    The Pentagon made the announcements yesterday and the State
Department said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Brown had
been called home to supervise a security review of the embassy,
which is alleged to have been penetrated by Soviet KGB agents
helped by Marine guards.
    Brown is an ex-Marine who once was an economic officer at
the Moscow mission.
    Marine Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, was charged yesterday with
espionage, conspiracy and failure to follow lawful orders in a
case which U.S. officials have said involved sex with Soviet
women. Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, whose arrest triggered the
spy-sex scandal, has already been charged with espionage.
    Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims told reporters a third Marine,
Staff Sgt. Robert Stanley Stufflebeam, 24, who served in Moscow
between 1985 and 1986 at the same time as Lonetree and Bracy,
was being held on suspicion of lying to investigators about
contacts with foreign nationals.
    Stufflebeam, who was second in command of the embassy
guard, is suspected of failure to report all contacts with
foreigners and making false official statements in his
debriefing when he left the embassy.

<TITLE>ICO COFFEE PRODUCERS TO DISCUSS MARKET SITUATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Coffee Organization, ICO,
producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general
discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman
Lindenberg Sette said.
    The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the
meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive
board's regular session this week has so far been confined to
routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to
revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.
    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when
producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how
quotas should be allocated.
    Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among
producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most
countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September
council session to restart negotiations.
    Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for
today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market
situation, the producer delegates said.
    The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week
was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices
in London and New York futures, traders said.
    Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at
1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.
    The executive board session looks set to end today,
following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a
consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be
presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.

<TITLE>EIGHT CALABRIAN BANK OFFICIALS RELEASED FROM JAIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy, April l - </DATELINE><BODY>Eight banking officials
arrested on embezzlement charges nine days ago have been
released from jail on provisional liberty, pending a hearing of
charges in court, judicial sources said.
    The president, vice-president, former president,
director-general and four other managers at the southern
Italian &lt;Cassa di Risparmio di Calabria e Lucania - Carical>
had been released but were still under investigation for an
alleged embezzlement conspiracy. Three other bank officials are
still being held in custody.
    Those released include former Carical president Francesco
Del Monte, who was vice-president of one of Italy's largest
state banks &lt;BNL - Banca Nazionale del Lavoro> at the time of
his arrest. BNL said last week it had appointed another member
of the board to take on the role of vice-president temporarily.
    The arrests followed the appointment by the Bank of Italy
of three commissioners to run Carical temporarily following
investigations revealing serious irregularities at the bank.
    Police sources say the embezzlement charges relate to loans
given by the bank to the southern Italian-based food processing
firm Jonicagrumi.

<TITLE>OTTAWA SAID BACKING DOWN ON BANKING CENTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian federal government is
backing down on its plans to give Vancouver and Montreal
special status as international banking centers, Ontario's
minister of financial institutions Monte Kwinter said.
    He told journalists that little concrete activity had taken
place since the announcement in February 1986 that the two
cities would gain a special status, while Toronto, despite its
position as Canada's main financial centre, would not.
    "They (the federal government) have sent a confusing signal
to world financial markets," Kwinter said. "It was done for
political reasons and it's going to backfire on them."
    Kwinter said rules for the equity requirements for foreign
banks coming in under Ontario's financial deregulation had also
not yet been agreed between federal and provincial governments.
    While the federal government wanted to set up a regulatory
authority for banks, Ontario was pushing to regulate according
to function, arguing that those in the securities industry, no
matter if bank or broker, should be regulated in the same way.
    On June 30, Ontario is to introduce rules to allow banks,
insurances and trust companies, as well as non-securities
investors, to buy dealers. Non-residents will be allowed to own
up to 50 pct of market makers, rising to 100 pct after a year.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden announced tax increases on
petrol and heating oil from July 1, 1987 to help finance a 1.7
pct rise in defence spending over the next five years.
    A Finance Ministry statement said the increase should boost
the price of petrol by 0.13 crowns to an average of 4.21 crowns
per litre while light-grade heating oil would go up by 30
crowns per cubic metre to an average of 1,665 crowns.
    It said oil companies should absorb part of the tax rise
internally and not pass it on to consumers as compensation for
a reduction in the stocks that the industry is required to keep
for Sweden's national petroleum reserve.

<TITLE>TANZANIA OUTLINES NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tanzania will need about 1.2
billion dlrs of hard currency investment to support its
1987-1992 five-year plan which begins in July, Minister of
State for Finance Damas Mbogoro said.
    He told an economic planning seminar in the northern town
of Arusha yesterday that the new plan would concentrate on
rehabilitating Tanzania's existing infrastructure, with a
minimum of investment in new development projects.
    The aim is to boost agricultural production by five pct a
year and industrial output by 6.4 pct, he said.
    In 1985, before president Ali Hassan Mwinyi began
dismantling Tanzania's doctrinaire socialist policies to
implement his current economic recovery program, agricultural
production grew by only 0.6 pct, while industrial output
declined by 5.2 pct.
    Mbogoro said the success of the new five-year plan would
depend greatly on the ability to exercise self-discipline and
make best use of limited resources. Prime Minister Joseph
Warioba and Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya have both stressed
that government departments must exercise financial discipline
and live within their budgets.

<TITLE>KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kenya's economy will continue to expand
this year and the government will do more to encourage
investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,
Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.
    He told a news conference that the government would soon
create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment
applications by local and foreign investors.
    Praising the role of multinational companies and local
entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
1985, Ouko said.
    This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee
exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,
he added.
    "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," the
planning minister said.
    "High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade
liberalisation and disciplined financial management are
expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector," he
said.
    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
announced in February, the minister added.
    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
increased during the second half of last year.
    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
he said.
    Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its
contribution to the economy and promised to improve government
cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact
with them.
    "I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its
contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to
maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector
grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same
period the previous year," he said.
    Ouko said the "one stop" bureau was intended to stimulate
investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved
in processing applications.
    The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan
economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation
falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.
    This was owing to higher agricultural production and the
Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major
currencies, the report said.
    The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr
last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half
yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in
July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during
the period.
    This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of
780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,
compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in
the second half of 1985, it said.

<TITLE>LONDON STOCK SYSTEM BIG SUCCESS, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The restructured London Stock Exchange
has proved itself an unqualified success in less than
six months of operation, according to exchange chairman Sir
Nicholas Goodison.
    More than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floor
and is now conducted in the offices of member firms, Goodison
said in remarks prepared for delivery in New York.
    "Competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens all
over the country and business done is displayed on those same
screens," he said, reaching more investors than before.
    Goodison said the new system has helped investors by
promoting greater competition that in turn has led to reduced
commissions and spread.
    He said the exchange is now working on a small order
automated execution system and a system to transfer securities
without certificates.
    New laws to be enacted in full later this year will help
the Securities and Investments Board investigate suspected
abuses and punish wrongdoing, Goodison said. He believes it is
a misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulation
is not as good as the U.S. system.
    He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal
offense. "There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K.
inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," Goodison
said, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allows
individuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may
incriminate themselves.
    Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is to
persuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in
London. He said about 200 U.S. companies are now listed in
London, enhancing their ability to raise capital.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said
Southmark Corp and affiliate Pratt Hotels Corp have ended talks
with his MTS Acquisition Corp on a possible joint venture for
the acquisition of Caesars World Inc.
    Sosnoff said the talks had not been actively pursued since
they were announced March 20, but it had been agreed that
unless the discussions were formally terminated, Pratt and
Southmark would not initiate a competing tender offer for
Caesars World or take any other action that would hamper
Sosnoff's current offer to acquire all Caesars shares he does
not now own for 28 dlrs each.
    Sosnoff said his 28 dlr per share bid for Caesars, which is
scheduled to expire May 15, still stands, and he remains
receptive to negotiating a transaction to buy Caesars on
friendly terms.
    Pratt recently made an apparently unsuccessful bid to
acquire control of Resorts International Inc &lt;RTB>, seeming to
lose out to Donald Trump.

<TITLE>JAPAN REBUFFS BRITAIN IN TELECOMS ROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has reiterated it has no plans to
bow to pressure to give foreign telecommunications companies a
major role in a planned new firm.
    An official at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications
told Reuters the ministry's position is unchanged despite
mounting pressure from London and Washington. He declined
comment on local press reports which said the ministry would
back a plan aimed at cooling British anger on the issue.
    The press reports said Fumio Watanabe, head of the
Federation of Economic Organisations, would propose that
Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc be given a five pct stake in a
telecommunications firm and a seat on the board.
    Watanabe was unavailable for comment. He has the tacit
backing of the government in his efforts to merge two
telecommunications companies into one competitor to Kokusai
Denwa Denshin (KDD), which has a monopoly on international
telephone services here, industry analysts said.
    In London yesterday, a Cable and Wireless spokesman said
the latest reported proposals are unacceptable.
    Cable and Wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the two
companies involved in the mooted merger.
    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has personally
taken up the company's cause, charging that Japan is
discriminating against foreigners.
    The United States also has vented its anger at what it sees
as Japanese attempts to limit foreign participation.
    Watanabe originally proposed Cable and Wireless be given up
to 3.0 pct of the merged firm. The press reports said this
could be raised to 5.0 pct, equal to the largest share of any
Japanese firm. Britain opposes the proposed merger. REUTER

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN BANK STRIKE STARTS TO CRUMBLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>An eight-day-old national bank strike
started to crumble following a warning from the federally-owned
Banco do Brasil that it could dismiss employees who did not
return to work, a union spokesman said.
    Banco do Brasil's staff in several major cities, including
Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba, had decided to return to
work. Probably about half of the country's bank staff would be
working, he added.

<TITLE>CPC INTERNATIONAL &lt;CPC> TO SELL ASIAN STAKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>CPC International Inc
said said it has agreed in principle to sell interests in its
grocery products operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand to &lt;Ajinomoto Co
Inc> of Japan for 340 mln dlrs.
    The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a
substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
    It said as part of the agreement, its current direct
investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with
Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for
the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.
    The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement
will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a
continuing earnings stream and cash flow.
    The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and
government approvals.
    CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are
proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments,
including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture
to an Australian partner.
    The company said the actions being taken under its
restructuring program, including the sale of its European corn
wet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions and
other expense items and the Asian transactions, will have a
one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.
    CPC said "Although the extent cannot yet be determined, the
company expects that 1987 earnings per share will increase by
substantially more than the previously estimated 20 pct
increase over 1986."  In 1986 CPC earned 2.30 dlrs per share.

<TITLE>HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jerry Bieszk, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report
yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year
as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged
producers to step up production, analysts said.
    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as
bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply
lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in
nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.
    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"The
report shows that hog producers have responded to a very
desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10
months."
    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures
prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures
fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still
lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy
selling pressure today.
    "We have not had a period of profitability of this
magnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hog
operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been
so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back
on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog
operation alone."
    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was
negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the
slaughter increased from the previous year.
    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we
didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state
spring report, Levitt added.
    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that
could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased
profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to
increase production starting late last year.
    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog
herd resulted from a revision of the December report and
without the revision, the March report might have been very
close to average expectations.
    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major
upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding
herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more
bearish than initially indicated.
    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report
to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant
contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because
traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.
    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into
consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May
farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1
report, Fuller said.
    Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned,
if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60
lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a
tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us
to push down to the prices that the current futures show for
the July and August period."
    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that
distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than
they were last summer.
    "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs
during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper
this year because we have six pct more numbers," he said.

    The Democratic leader told reporters he could not tell them

House voted to override yesterday.
    "If the veto is sustained, it won't be because of pork, it
will be because of politics," Byrd said.
    He has contended the White House was applying pressure on

<TITLE>THYSSEN SEES UP TO 20 PCT LOWER SALES IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thyssen AG &lt;THYH.F> expects a fall of
between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87,
chief executive Dieter Spethmann said.
    He told journalists the exact decline would depend on
dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its
business outside West Germany.
    Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World
group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended
September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales
which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32
billion.
    Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen
expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected
losses in the mass steel-making operations this year.
    Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this
year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel
turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's
trading operations, he said.
    Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article
published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and
Heinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG,
over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.

<TITLE>MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - SLOW COUNTRY MOVEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cash grain dealers reported slow country
movement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with even
corn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this week
drying up.
    Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the posted
county price at the Gulf to take into account high barge
freight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but added
the current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if
it will work as hoped.
    Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on the
Illinois and MidMississippi River due to the strong barge
freight rates. Toledo and Chicago elevators were finishing
loading the first corn boats of the new shipping season,
supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.

<TITLE>COASTAL &lt;CGP> SEEKS OK OF TRANSAMERICAN PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coastal Corp said its board will be
asked to approve the company's plan to reorganize
&lt;Transamerican Natural Gas Corp> at its April 14 meeting.
    Coastal said the plan is expected to be filed with the
federal Bankruptcy Court on April 15.
    Transamerican has been operating under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code since January 1983. Owned by John R.
Stanley, it was formerly known as GHR Energy Corp. The
bankruptcy arose from the collapse of GHR's Good Hope
Refineries Inc, which operated a refinery at Good Hope, La.
    Coastal also said it will file detailed objections to the
disclosure statement filed earlier by Transamerican.
    Coastal has requested its plan and disclosure statement be
set for hearing in Bankruptcy Court Judge Manuel Leal's court
on April 28 and 29 along with the Transamerican plan.
    Coast said a ruling this week by Judge Leal freed the
company to work with Transamerican's creditors and other
interested parties in developing a reorganization plan.

<TITLE>FED BUYS ONE BILLION DLRS OF BILLS FOR CUSTOMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is buying one
billion dlrs of Treasury bills for customer account for
delivery today, a spokesman for the bank said.
    Fed funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct at the time of the
purchase, which came several hours before the Fed normally
transacts business for its customers.
    Economists said the purchase was almost certainly related
to the investment of proceeds from recent central bank
intervention in the foreign exchanges.
    The Bank of Japan alone is estimated to have bought about
six billion dlrs in March in a bid to prop up the dollar.

<TITLE>KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kenya's economy will continue to expand
this year and the government will do more to encourage
investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,
Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.
    He told a news conference that the government would soon
create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment
applications by local and foreign investors.
    Praising the role of multinational companies and local
entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the
country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and
rising real incomes, he added.
    "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," the
planning minister said.
    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
announced in February, the minister added.
    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
increased during the second half of last year.
    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
he said.

<TITLE>MILLER SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES U.S. EXCISE TAX HIKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Office of Management and Budget
director James Miller said President Reagan opposes increases
in the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol to
help reduce the federal budget deficit.
    In an address before a group of House Republicans, Miller
reiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. "I think
also he would opose an increase in the gas tax."
    He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed his
opposition to a cigarette tax hike. "In the case of the
cigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax is
higher than now, and the same on wine and spirits."
    Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a tax
hike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the
1988 financial year.
    House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommend
an 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988
budget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left to
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.
    Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenue
increases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrak
railroad, higher federal fees for services and larger
individual payments for social programs.
    "It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no tax
increase," Miller said.
    He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set a
new tax on security transactions was "a nonstarter" with the
White House. The tax would be a tax on capital which would
discourage all but the most profitable short-term transactions
and could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.
    "Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any tax
increase," Miller urged the Republicans.
    Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for
1988.

May 1991 and had taken an option to buy on two more.
    Finnair chief Gunnar Korhonen would not discuss the price
further than telling reporters the planes were "inexpensive,"
though market sources said the airline could expect a price cut
as an earlier customer.
   Korhonen said Finnair had not opted for Europe's A-340 plane
because of uncertainty about the manufacturing of its engines,
which may have delayed production of the jet.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATOR HITS PROPOSED FARM BUDGET CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said it would be impossible to
cut two billion dlrs from the fiscal 1988 agriculture budget as
proposed by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles
(D-Fla.)
    "I don't know how we could possibly absorb two billion dlrs
of cuts without enormous disruptions," Leahy told the National
Cattlemen's Association.
    Chiles has proposed making unspecified policy changes that
would trim two billion dlrs from farm income and price support
programs in the fiscal year beginning next October.
    Leahy said such cuts would be impossible, that one billion
dlrs in cuts would be "darn near impossible" and that a spending
freeze would be difficult.
    Leahy said Congress would have to provide "some money" for
the Farm Credit System, but that a "wholesale bailout" would not
be forthcoming.
    "We may need changes in (the system's) procedures but we
will not let the system go belly up or simply become another
bank," he said.
    A task force composed of Leahy and Sens. David Boren
(D-Okla.), Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)
is working on a proposal for assisting the Farm Credit System
that Leahy said should be ready shortly after Congress's Easter
recess, set for April 13 through 20.
    Leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheat
and feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal to
establish mandatory production controls.
    However, he said a bill offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)
and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would probably not pass
Congress as presently written.
    A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance to
midwestern grain producers, already passed by the House, may
not be considered by the Senate for another 10 days because
members have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costing
billions of dollars, he said.

Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) charged Japan with lying and

     "The Japanese, not to put too fine a point on it, have

     Leahy said the Reagan administration's plan to raise

Tokyo's violation of a bilateral semiconducter pact was "long

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>French farmers are planning to cut their
maize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year
from the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French Maize
Producers' Association, AGPM, said.
    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated
cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of
Picardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last
year.
    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings
were estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested
244,000 ha.
    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine
pct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In the
south-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar
area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water
supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the
last two years of drought.
    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,
said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at
between 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last
year, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against
last year's harvested 48,000.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPORT CREDIT AGENCY CHANGES PREMIUMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Export Credit Guarantee
Department (ECGD) said it would change the system of premiums
it levies from British exporters, reducing their costs when
they tender for a contract abroad.
    It said in a statement that the changes involved halving
the rate of non-refundable premiums levied by the ECGD from
exporters before the contract they tender for is allocated. The
rates of additional premium paid by successful tenderers will
rise.
 The last overhaul in premiums was in 1984 when charges for
cover rose sharply after several years of heavy losses.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole said she was cautiously optimistic the Senate would
sustain President Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway
bill today.
    "I believe that there will be the votes to sustain the
president's veto," she said on NBC's "Today" program.
    But she added, "Whether or not the president wins on this
particular issue he is a winner because he has stood up for
fiscal responsibility."
    The House voted 350-73 yesterday to override Reagan's veto
but the bill dies unless the Senate also votes by more than
two-thirds to override the veto and enact the bill into law.

<TITLE>JARDINE DECLINES COMMENT ON HONGKONG LAND REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Jardine Matheson Holdings
Ltd &lt;JARD.HK> said he could neither confirm nor deny a
newspaper report which said Jardine was thinking of moving its
listed property subsidiary &lt;Hongkong Land Ltd> to Bermuda.
    "I don't know how the report was originated ... I cannot
comment," the spokesman at Jardine's London office said when
asked to react to a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
    The report said Jardine, which moved its place of domicile
from Hong Kong to Bermuda in the wake of the agreement to
transfer the British colony back to China in 1997, was
contemplating a similar move for Hongkong Land.
    The Daily Telegraph quoted Jardine chairman Simon Keswick
as saying Hongkong Land was at a crossroads now that all its
non-property assets as well as its major residential properties
in Hong Kong are being sold off.
    This left the company to focus its attention on prime site
commercial property in Hong Kong's city centre only, it said.
    "If we can't find any opportunities here we may have to look
abroad ... If we look abroad the structure of the company
becomes very important," Keswick was quoted as saying.

<TITLE>U.S., ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a 
case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging
unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.
    Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late
yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with
Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a
trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.
    Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,
Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and
products, U.S. and Argentine officials said.
    The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean
Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential
export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.
    The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section
301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on
soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and
represented an unfair trade practice.
    Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.
government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina
took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would
consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine
officials said.
    An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for
removal of the Argentine export taxes.

<TITLE>M/A-COM &lt;MAI> EXPANDS BUYBACK, NAMES PRESIDENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BURLINGTON, Mass., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>M/A-Com Inc said its board
authorized the repurchase of up to five mln of the company's
common shares from time to time in the open market or private 
transactions.
    The company also said its board named Thomas Burke
president and chief executive officer.
    The buyback authorization is in addition to a previous
approval last September to repurchase 12 mln shares.
    The company currently has about 32.2 mln shares
outstanding, after completion of the buyback of nearly all of
the 12 mln shares, a spokesman said.
    The repurchase of the additional five mln shares will
depend on market conditions, the telecommunications and
microwave components company said.
    Burke, 57, has been chief operating officer of M/A-Com
since last November. Before that he was executive vice
president, finance and administration.
    In February 1986, M/A-Com's former chairman, president and
chief executive, Richard DiBona, suffered a stroke. After that,
director Frank Brand, who had been executive vice president,
was named acting chief executive and director Irving Hellman
was named acting chairman.
    Brand and Hellman gave up their interim posts yesterday,
the spokesman said, adding the company will have no chairman
for the time being.
    In a statement, Burke said he plans to announce a major
change in the company's organization in the next few days. The
spokesman declined to elaborate.

<TITLE>CIBA-GEIGY UNIT SPINS OFF INTO OPERATING GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Ciba-Geigy Ltd> announced the
formation of its Ciba Vision Group, becoming the first group
within the corporate structure to carry the Ciba name.
    The Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant said the new group,
which formerly operated under its U.S. pharmaceutical division,
represents the first time Ciba has developed an operating group
from within its corporate structure.
    It said other operating groups have been established
through acquisitions.
    Ciba's Vision Group will be headed by James MacDonald,
president and chief operating officer.
    MacDonald said the group will be based outside of
Frankfurt, W. Germany, near its research and development
facility.
    Sales from the group in 1986 were approximately 160 mln
dlrs, the company said.
    "The designation of Ciba Vision as an independent operating
group underscores Ciba-Geigy's anticipation of continued
growth," MacDonald told a group of reporters. 
    Silvano Ghirardi, head of the group's international
marketing operations, said he expects Ciba Vision to become
possibly the second leading vision care products company in the
industry by the end of the year. Bausch and Lomb &lt;BOL>, he
said, was the industry leader.
    "Right now we are trying to solidify the group and bring it
together under one group," Ghirardi said.
    Ghiirardi told Reuters the group considered Japan one of
the prime markets in which it intends to expand.
    MacDonald told reporters the group planned to expand
through acquisition and internal growth.
    He said Ciba Vision's sales have grown an average of more
than 200 pct a year since 1981, the year after the group was
formed.

<TITLE>GERMAN BOURSE TURNOVER FOR FIRST QUARTER DETAILED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share and bond turnover on all eight
West German bourses in the first 1987 quarter was valued at
483.4 billion marks, according to the new method of calculating
turnover, the Association of German bourses said in a
statement.
    The statement, however, did not give figures on the total
number of share and bond units transacted.
    While shares posted a turnover worth 187.9 billion marks,
bond turnover was 295.4 billion marks. No comparative figures
were available because of the new method of calculation.
    In March, share and bond turnover rose 28 pct to 181.1
billion marks from the previous month, reversing the sharp
turnover drop in February. Average daily turnover rose to 8.2
billion marks against 7.0 billion in February.
    Bond turnover jumped 33 pct to 113.3 billion marks in
March, giving an average transaction value of 455,000 marks
each on the total 249,000 transactions. More than 90 pct of the
turnover was in public authority bonds.
    Share turnover rose 22 pct to 67.8 billion marks. With 1.5
mln deals, share transactions averaged 45,000 marks each.
    German shares accounted for Nearly 80 pct of share
turnover. Foreign shares took up over eight pct and domestic
and foreign options, about 12 pct. Deutsche Bank &lt;DBKG.F> was
the most traded share in March, with 4.7 billion marks worth
changing hands. Siemens &lt;SIEG.F> was next with 4.5 billion
marks, Bayer &lt;BAYG.F> 4.0 billion, Volkswagen &lt;VOWG.F> 3.4
billion, Daimler-Benz &lt;DAIG.F> 3.4 billion, Veba &lt;VEBG.F> 2.4

2.0 billion, BASF &lt;BASF.F> 1.8 billion and AEG AG &lt;AEGG.F> 1.5
