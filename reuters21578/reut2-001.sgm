<TITLE>TAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKERS EXCHANGE RATE PLEA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing
orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for
the Taiwan Textile Federation said.
    He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last Saturday the government could not fix the
Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to
U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    The federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro - BNL> said it would issue 120 mln dlrs of five-year
convertible eurobonds, an operation to be lead-managed by
&lt;Credit Suisse-First Boston Ltd>.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the
issue, to be placed on the main international markets and
listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by
an Italian bank on the Euromarket.
    BNL officials said the issue is scheduled for mid-March and
additional financial details were not immediately available.
    They said the operation would be through the issue of
depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds
would carry warrants issued by its &lt;Efibanca> subsidiary and
convertible into BNL saving shares within five years.
    The officials said a banking consortium led by Credit
Suisse-First Boston would at the same time arrange for the
private placing of an unspecified number of BNL savings shares
with foreign institutional investors.
    The operation was to further its aim of obtaining a listing
on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital
increases through ordinary share issues, they said.

has revised downward its previously reported fourth quarter and
year, ended October 31, results to reflect compensation expense
for employee stock options.
    The company said resolution of this disagreement with its
auditors came as a result of Securities and Exchange Commission
involvement. The company will amend its option-granting
procedure to conform to the SEC decision which will eliminate
future charges, it added.
    Transform said its fourth quarter profit was revised to
305,082 dlrs, or two cts a share, from the previously reported
580,955 dlrs, which left the company with a fiscal 1986 loss of
249,814 dlrs, or two cts a share, instead of the reported
26,195 dlrs profit.

<TITLE>UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
    The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.
    The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.

said after the release of a sharply lower January leading
indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.
    "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net
exports," he said in a statement after the department reported
the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest
drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984.
    The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct
December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for
plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kenyan economy is heading for
difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
1985, he added.
    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
reserves during the year," he said.
    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
capital for the first time in its history, he added.
    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
sources to finance our development," he said.
    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of new single-family homes in
the United States fell 6.8 pct in January from December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 716,000 units, the Commerce
Department said.
    The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1

    Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually
sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down
from 59,000 in January, 1986.
    The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct
below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted

94,000 dlrs in January a year ago.
    New homes available on the market in January totaled a
seasonally adjusted 362,000 units, unchanged from December and
equal to a 6.3 months' supply.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing
four information technology systems that will be led by today's
highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.
    The company said information management products will be
the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of
Kodak."
    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those
sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.
    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications
campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
commitment to the business and industrial sector.
    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
information management systems unveilded today --
    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information
management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system
that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
information management systems.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,
computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.
    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a
write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will
market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
1988.
    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed
out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000
in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system 
allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
2.6 gigabytes.
    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of
the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually
loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
the more powerful KIMS system 5000.
    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and
software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987
and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.

<TITLE>BANGOR HYDRO &lt;BANG> SEEKS RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGOR, Maine, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it
has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for
a two-stage base rate reduction.
    Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect
on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a
final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln
dlrs, or 9.7 pct.
    The company said lower federal income taxes and lower
capital costs prompted the filing.
    The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the
MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue
reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.
    Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce
residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1.
    The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its
fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.
    Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset
much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some
customers' rates.

<TITLE>PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast
earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
at their present parities.
    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular
Inc.

William Proxmire said modified legislation to help a federal
deposit insurance fund and prohibit new limited-service banks
and thrifts could be ready for a Senate vote in two to three
weeks.
    Proxmire said he agreed to demands from committee members
for a one-year moratorium on granting new business powers
sought by commercial banks to increase the bill's chances.
    In its new form, the bill would proscribe regulators from
granting new powers to banks, Proxmire told reporters after a
speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
    A vote on the bill by the committee is scheduled for
Thursday. If approved it will go to the full Senate.
    "I have spoken to the majority leader and he has agreed to
bring it up promptly on the Senate floor in two or three weeks,"
Proxmire told the thrift executives.
    The bill would recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp fund with 7.5 billion dlrs.
    It also would prohibit establishment of new nonbank banks
and nonthrift thrifts, so-called because they provide financial
services but do not meet the regulatory definition of both
making loans and receiving deposits.

seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of

    The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate

February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in
1987.
    Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct
in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in
the third quarter.
    Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in
the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8

western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two
nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.
    Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and

    Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of

    The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow
cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two

    Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last
night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> DISCOUNTS TALK ON PAN AM &lt;PN> DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp chairman Robert Crandall,
denying industry speculation, said the company is not
interested in acquiring shuttle routes in the northeast region
of the U.S. from Pan Am Corp.
    But in remarks at a press conference announcing a major
aircraft order, he said AMR would be interested in certain
other Pan Am assets. But he noted that none had been made
available.
    Pan Am earlier today announced an order for 40 new aircraft
from Boeing Co &lt;BA> and &lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European
consortium, for an estimated 2.5 billion dlrs.
    AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has said it is not
interested in acquiring Pan Am as a whole and Crandall
reiterated that position today.
    "Assets are one thing, and companies are another," Crandall

Lavoro-BNL> said it is negotiating to buy a West German bank as
part of its foreign expansion policy.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian
bank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the
German institution.
    He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL's reply to
Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>, which entered the Italian market in
December 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica &lt;BACN>
subsidiary &lt;Banca D'America e D'Italia>.
    Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line
to the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay
for Italian imports. He gave no further details.
    BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase
its activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative
office in Moscow this month through its subsidiary &lt;Sogecred>,
which specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.

enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase

System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at

rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> HOPES FOR FIVE-FOLD RISE IN EUROPEAN SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes to
sell between 7,000 and 8,000 vehicles in Europe this year, a
five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-president
of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he said at
a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.
    Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his
projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln
and 104 mln dlrs in Europe.
    GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500
vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the
then strong dollar, Fry said.
    All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the
United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were
in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The collapse of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Treasury official C. Fred
Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

<TITLE>SYRIA SAYS ISRAEL BLOCKS CITRUS EXPORT FROM GAZA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Syria has complained to the
United Nations that Israeli occupation authorities were
blocking the export of citrus fruit from the Gaza Strip to the
countries of the European Community, EC.
    In a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
published here today, Syrian U.N. charge d'affaires Abdul
Mou'men Al-Atassi said: "These measures threaten to create a
slump in citrus production, which constitutes the primary
source of income in the Gaza Strip....They are causing heavy
losses to farmers and all those working in the field of citrus
production and threaten to bring about economic disaster."
    The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of
the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of
the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations."
    The Gaza Strip, occupied by Egypt in the 1948 Arab-Israel
war, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>There was no evidence of winterkill
in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line
running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
report.
    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
because of dry conditions.
    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
last fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
report said.
    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
under these conditions, they said.
    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the
field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it
emerged from winter.

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's current account deficit widened
to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,

was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.

a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Corp said the fresh start
provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to
1987 earnings per share.
    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln
dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.
    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the
fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening
tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes
into earnings.
    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline
gradually over the next four years, during which time
Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.
    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to
have a significant impact on earnings.

<TITLE>BELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the
European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats
and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
States.
    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration
officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference
there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
oils used in the 12 EC countries.
    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because
there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will
be a compromise."
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and
access to community markets.
    De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone
its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to
cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was
made toward resolving differences with the United States.
    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and
the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.
    He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal
with another controversial health proposal that would forbid
the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the
United States.
    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be
resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.
    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change
slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a
few months later by the hormone rule.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at
12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2,
the central bank weekly return showed.
    The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion
guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of
interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in
the form of tax payments to the state.
    Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the
public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival
or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.
    Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for
call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between
5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12
month periods, dealers said.
    The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion
guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared
with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.
    They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12
billion guilders this week.
    The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency
reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Banking committee chairman
Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., called for caution in giving
savings associations forbearance in paying their debts as part
of a bill providing three billion dlrs in new capital for the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    "We cannot let forbearance stretch to protect the
mismanaged or terminal cases that would serve to further drain
the FSLIC fund," St Germain said at the start of a hearing on
FSLIC legislation. "Forbearance must be designed to help the
well managed institution temporarily on hard times. It must not
be forgiveness for the speculators, the high flyers and the
fast buck artists."
    The use of forbearance for well-managed institutions was
endorsed at the hearing by Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner
L.L. Bowman, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and the Texas
Savings and Loan League.

its board approved plans to offer a stock option plan for its
cable television operators.
    The company said it will offer the options in exchange for
a commitment to operate the company's programs to a set number

five year extension option.
    If the operator agrees to the plan, they will receive
options to buy 10 dlrs worth of common stock for each cable
subscriber committed, or 20 dlrs per subscriber, if they agree
to run both programs, the company explained.
    The company said the option will vest over a five year
period at the rate of 20 pct per year.
    The company, which offered a similar program last year,
said the current one is directed for those who did not sign up
last year, and for new carriers of the company's home shopping
video shows.

<TITLE>U.S. SETS CORN DEFICIENCY PAYMENT HALF PIK CERTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The upcoming five-month deficiency
payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash
and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior
Agriculture Department official told Reuters.
    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or
"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,
Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state
and county operations, said.
    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs
ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be
delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer
program, von Garlem said.
get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in
certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).
    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at
signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half
of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said
this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most
farmers got advance payments.
    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300
mln dlrs," he said.
    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had
resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we
proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."

<TITLE>FORD CANADA &lt;FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OAKVILLE, Ontario, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd,
90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, said the earlier reported
decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover
costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.
    Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter
results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product
program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.
    The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell
to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter
profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior
year.
    Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian
operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth
quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in
the prior year.
    Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from
its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in
1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to
18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of
4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985,
excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.
    Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent
company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion
dlrs.
    The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln
dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter
results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies,
cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were
partially offset by lower industry volumes.
    Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas
operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased
interest costs, the company said.
    Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share
of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said.
The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in
1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.
    Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car
and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were
Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986.

<TITLE>FIRESTONE &lt;FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has
notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its
Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire
plants on or before September 15.
    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be
covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company
took in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    The company said it was notified by the union March one
that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City
tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other
plants. 
    Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of
its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers
for several months.
    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding
it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to
work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of
the three tire plants, it added.
    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants
in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being
designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master
agreement with the rubber workers.
    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the
leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans
to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits
and work rules.
    Union procedures, however, require approval by the
Firestone section of the union's International Policy
Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master
contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.
    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package
by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the
limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and
off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude
the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would
permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and
Bloomington plants.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct
of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr
foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.
    Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said
last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public
sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected
Venezuela's improved credit image.
    "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot
be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.
    Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory
committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor
from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to
1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.
    "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a
marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this
year," Lusinchi said.
    He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the
Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to
reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case,
because of the vulnerability of its economy."
    Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in
February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of
falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.
    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to
sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter,
but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.
    Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been
contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public
Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to
round up support.
    Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised
were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the
outlines of a government plan to allow public and private
sector debt capitalisation.
    He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans
to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.
    "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now
have to define more precisely what projects can be financed
from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel
and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to
materialise.

countries are considering a U.S. proposal to set up a study
group to review the world copper market, delegates said.
    The U.S. initiative was introduced last December at a
meeting held here under the auspices of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
    The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second
biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to
improve statistics and market transparency of the copper
economy, and provide a forum for discussion.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end
Friday.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>PANTERA &lt;PANT> AND PIZZA &lt;PZA> AGREE TO MERGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, MO., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pantera's Corp said it agreed in
principle to acquire Pizza Inn Inc in a cash and stock
transaction.
    Under terms of the proposed transaction, each Pizza Inn
share can be exchanged for either three dlrs in cash plus the
lesser of 1.4 shares of Pantera's common stock or 11.50 dlrs
market value of Pantera's stock, or four dlrs in cash plus a
unit consisting of one share of Pantera's stock and a
non-transferrable right to receive up to 0.55 share of
Pantera's stock under certain conditions, it said.
    Completion of the transaction is subject to arrangement of
financing, negotiation of a definitive agreement, and various
regulatory approvals, it said.
    Pantera's said Pizza Inn's largest shareholder, F.J.
Spillman, previously granted Pantera's an option to buy more
than one mln shares of Pizza Inn common stock owned by him.
    Pantera's also said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its
financial advisor, Pantera's said.
    Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ,
while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex
halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger.
    From its Dallas headquarters, Pizza Inn said completion of
the transaction is subject to certain conditions including that
the price of Pantera's stock average not less than seven dlrs
during the 20 trading days before the merger.
    Under the agreement, Pizza Inn said it will still be
permitted to complete a leveraged buyout agreement with Pizza
Inn Acquiring Corp, which has been approved by its
shareholders, but is subject to otaining financing.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new
company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old
Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.
    The communique was issued after two days of talks here
between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and
Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.
    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria
16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,
but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in
world iron ore markets.
    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be
decided after a project feasibility study. This would be
completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials
said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World
Bank, which is also expected to give financial support.
    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,
will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early
1990.
    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for
uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed
that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to
cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and
silver.

<DATELINE>    RICHARDSON, Texas, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Electrospace Systems Inc said
it was ordered by the U.S. Army to immediately proceed with the
design and production of a computer-based control system for
the army's tactical voice and data communications network, in a
contract potentially worth 101 mln dlrs.
    It said the order followed a favorable ruling by the
General Accounting Office on two protests that earlier caused a
stop work order on the 26.8 mln dlr contract, awarded last
September. It said that order covers 59 mobile shelter-based
systems and 44 remote terminals, with options for 279 mobile
units and 178 remote units for a total of 101 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TEAM ARRIVES IN UGANDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A World Bank team led by senior
economist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an
economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs
over three years.
    The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three
weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here
over the same period, a World Bank offical said.
    The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on
deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues
likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery
program.
    Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most
of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating
industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors
and other agricultural needs.
    He did not say where the money would come from, but
diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other
foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.

lowered the ratings on Loral Corp's subordinated debt to BBB

    The issue is removed from creditwatch where it was placed
with negative implications in January after Loral said it
planned to acquire Goodyear Aerospace Corp for 640 mln dlrs.
    S/P said the acquisition enhances Loral's competitive
position in the defense electronics industry by broadening its
technology and program base. But most measures of financial

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange's traded
options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year,
and will more than double the range of options available by the
end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain
said.
    He told a news conference that more options contracts were
traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's
existence.
    Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts
traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from
19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth
was expected.
    "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of
1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible
constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.
    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be
introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc
&lt;SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> from
March 19.
    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United
States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two
currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an
option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.
    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate
the London options market's leading position in Europe,
especially important with French and Swiss equity options
trading planned to start this year.
    "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are
conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting
continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least
the next year.
    He said much of the recent growth in options had come from
inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But
now the retail options market was beginning to take off.
    The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted
floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left
almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in
the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have
encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.
    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to
equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a
final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.
    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options
market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the
options market would need more than half of the available
space.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

<TITLE>BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
react was to retaliate.
    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile
imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."
    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
U.S. trading partners.
    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
weakened by the Iran scandal.
    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we
could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."
    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes
on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We
have to avoid that."
    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
shipments of Asian textiles.
    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a
conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."
    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross
the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.
    "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two
big powers," De Croo said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press

will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

7,000 and 8,000 North American-made vehicles in Europe this
year, a five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-
president of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation said.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told a
news briefing before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 North American-made vehicles in
the 1986 model year.

    Fry said at an average price of 13,000 dollars, his
projected sales figure for North American-made GM cars in
Europe would mean turnover of between 91 million and 104
million dollars.
    GM sales in Europe of North American-made cars in the 1985
model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive
prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said.
    The North American-made GM vehicles sold in Europe are
manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, with
most sales in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.

International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement
on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto
Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation,
said.
    "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to
quotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry
on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the
delegations.
    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set quotas.
    The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1
but the full council is not due to meet again until September.
"I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Credits Guarantee Department has
named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed
from the list.

<TITLE>OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee producing countries must quickly
map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
coffee exporters' association, said.
    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
plummet.
    However, he said the market should also take into account
evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
near totality of the Central American crop.
    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
10 years.
    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
as well as for industrialized countries.
    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
those debts, he said.
    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"
Cardenas said.

<DATELINE>    LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tender Loving Care Health Care
Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the
term of their merger agreement until May 31.
    Tender Loving Care also said &lt;Norrell Corp> agreed not to
acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September
30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill
arrangement. 
    Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff
Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those
outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement
continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for
each Staff Builders share outstanding.
    As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders
meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and
adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.
    Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include
1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of
eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.
    Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a
revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy
statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff
Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue
to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote
about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned
meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the
proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after
the record date for the meeting.
    In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own
about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger.
    Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the
outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger,
Tender Loving Care said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is
clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who
follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell
parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.
    But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers
whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands
of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and
replacement parts.
    Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many
opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's
intensified competition and the large volume of production in
North America planned by Japanese automakers.
    But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated
than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big
Three - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.
    Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will
decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street
financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and
somewhat less so on Chrysler.
    And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the
industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its
sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable
parts-making businesses.

<TITLE>SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or
exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,
the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce
soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.
    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the
European Community and South America in the January/March
quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported
in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it
said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding
periods of 1986.
    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of
probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed
and large scale butter imports that were expected from March
onward, it said.
    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain
area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the
recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.
    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had
been bought recently by the Soviet Union.

   Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
for special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"
he said.
    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co &lt;BA> and
&lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.
    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and
Co. "They're called walkaway leases."
    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus
but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the Caribbean and to Europe.
    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman
Robert Crandall.
    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"
Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off
balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.
Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range A300-600 planes.
    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of
Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will
give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s," he said.
    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund  said
it approved 125.9 mln SDR's to assist development in Jamaica.
    Of this total, 85 mln SDR's can be drawn over the next 15
months under a standby arrangement in support of the
government's economic and financial program.
    Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the
compensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds to
assist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said that
Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to
reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.
    After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for
Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly
as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,
and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.
    The program that the new funding supports is designed to
continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to
achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a
balance of payments viability in the medium term.

it will not establish further free-standing ovum transfer
centers and is exploring the establishment of general fertility
centers and alternative businesses.
    The company said this followed its evaluation of
unpublished technical information regarding some competing
technology which, if substantiated and replicated, could
adversely affect the company's operations.
    Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transfer
procedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertile
couples to consider among the several alternative procedures
available in advanced reproductive medicine.
    "In particular, it is medically and psychologically
superior to surrogate motherhood, because the fertilized egg is
transferred prior to the gestation process, rather than after
maternal bonding with the child has taken place," the company
explained without further reference to the unpublished
technical information.

<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hewlett Packard Co said it
unveiled the HP LaserJet Series II printer, the next generation
of its laser printer line.
    The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more
capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500
dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight
pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word
processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing.
    It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to
accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan
documents.
    The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000,
its first printer designed to be used with personal computer
networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print
20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs.
    It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device 
that scans printed images of text. The scanner works like a
photocopier storing the copied images on a hard disk, the
company said. It costs 1,495 dlrs.
    Hewlett Packard also said it brought out a new family of
plotter machines, the HP Draftmasters I and II. The new models
replace the HP 758X series of drafting-plotter line machines
used for computer aided design. The Draftmaster costs 9,900
dlrs, and the Draftsmaster II, 11,900 dlrs.
    A smaller plotter, called the DraftPro, was priced at 5,400
dlrs. It is designed for use with a personal computer.

<TITLE>PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent heavy rains have not affected the
Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative
groups said.
    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of
cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,
told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)
was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101
quintales in the year to September 1986.
    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood
waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the
crop was unaffected.
    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa
Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last
year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.
    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.
    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this
year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,
assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.
    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members
last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another
235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO
members.

<TITLE>GAO SAYS FSLIC SHOWS DEFICIT, NEEDS FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential
liability from insolvent savings associations, the General
Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing.
    "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to 
establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion
dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near
future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.
    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC
would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end
of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the
large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations
that continue to operate," Wolf said.
    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's
plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize
FSLIC.
    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC
insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were
insolvent.
    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,
earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three
quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations
lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.
    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.
    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight
billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings
associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said
are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

<TITLE>GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of General Electric Co's biggest
businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
Wall Street analysts said.
    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said
Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK> CONTINUES DRIVE INTO NEW MARKETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co, best known for its
cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost
its image as a diversified information systems company.
    The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new
electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast
computerized libraries of documents and pictures.
    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging
market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach
five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may
pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.
    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to
promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market
what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.
Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business
imaging systems division.
    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in
sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales
of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business
products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.
    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"
Greco said.
    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its
bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.
    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and
Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer
on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer
photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a
profit," he said.
     Kodak also announced the first commerically available
14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the
equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French exporters estimated that around
600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
    Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
1986 and February this year.
    Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
    France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
1985/86, according to customs figures.
    However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January
and making some purchases under the initiative.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD SEES BRAZIL LENDING PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financial
packages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,
"There is some evidence that this is already happening.
    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and there
was also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principal
payments on previously renegotiated debt.
    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussions
with Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," he
said.

Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in
aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto
salon.
    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9
sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet
aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for
Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in
Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.
     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum
structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto
making methods and plants.
    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a
car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and
performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It
said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as
present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65
pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.

<TITLE>F.W. WOOLWORTH'S &lt;Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gail Appleson, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The specialty retailing area continues
to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the United States.
    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."
    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee
on International Development Institutions.
    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.
    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

<TITLE>CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen and Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England proposed that banks
in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.
    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney magazine.
    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of
England is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of
England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...," the Bank's proposal said.
    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.
    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned
final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.
    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the
third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building
Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    However, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee
Department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    On collateral security, it said this "should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."
    "The presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. TO OFFER MISSILE TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile
reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow.
    Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the
White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max
Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for
consultations later this week. He said they will then return to
Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.
    Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday
to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces
(INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said:
"This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF
reductions."
    "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our
negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text
at Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said.
    He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to
be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet
missiles, "none is more important than verification ... Any
agreement must be effectively verifiable."
    The United States has been working closely with allies and
friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on
reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual
elimination, the president said.
     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed
upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in
Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader
insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on
long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.
    "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.
    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage
of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to
agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the
earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

<TITLE>GOODYEAR &lt;GT> CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on."
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

<TITLE>SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet winter grains could be off to
a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
for E.F. Hutton said.
    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
USDA analyst said.
    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.
    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
entire winter crop area, she said.
    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.
    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
a half," Martell said.

    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to

<TITLE>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales," Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally."
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    "The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

<TITLE>COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee prices may have to fall even lower
to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
traders said.
    The failure last night of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
close.
    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
under prices, some senior traders said.
    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
February last year following a sharp rise in international
prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed
at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it
is time to go and sell coffee."
    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
last year.
    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average
exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
Dauster said.
    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way
of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"
policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve
different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.
    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
and how much producers will sink their differences should
prices fall further and remain depressed.
    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.

the previously announced consolidation of federal supervisory
agencies into the new Office of the Superintendent of Financial

the December policy statement will be introduced later this

institutions and the new ownership policies.

high operating costs, an Alcan spokesman said.
    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about

spokesman Fernand Leclerc said.
    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to
modernize the plant.
    He said there is a possibility the company will sell the
smelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its
scheduled closing.

Reagan a bill that sets energy efficiency standards for major
household appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners,
washers and dryers and furnances.
    Final action came on a voice vote in the House. The Senate
had passed the bill, 89-6, on February 17.
    Reagan vetoed a similar bill last year after Congress had

    The standards will take effect over the next six years and
appliance manufacturers will then have five years to redesign
their appliances to meet the standards.

<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exports of American wine rose 14.9
per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons, the Wine
Institute said.
    The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent
of the exported wine was from California and the top three
markets were Canada, Japan and Britain.
    Japan, which edged out Britain as the leading importer of
American wines in 1985, continued in second place.
    Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons;
Japan, 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons, and Britain, 20.2
per cent to 962,360 gallons.
    A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of
the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the
California wine industry contributed significantly to the
increased shipments.
    The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs, up from
27.6 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> TO REPUCHASE COMMON STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp said its directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par
value common stock by the end of 1990.
    GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed
10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.
    It said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit,
will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by
reduced capital spending and anticipated performance
improvements.
    GM also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many
as five mln shares each of its class E and class H common, with
about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end.
    GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot
repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year.
    GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase
participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems
Corp &lt;GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp &lt;GMH> subsidiaries by
holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common.
    GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9
billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6
billion dlrs in 1986.
    It also said improvements in operating performance are
expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990.
    "We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that
it is producing the best products available in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace," said Chairman Roger B. Smith.
    GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common
outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of
class H outstanding at year end 1986.
    GM said that its par value holders currently participate in
the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes'
earnings.
    GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all
three classes of its common in connection with ongoing
requirements of various benefit plans.
    That buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares
of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E
and H common in 1987.
    GM said the repuchased shares of its par value common will
be held in its treasury indefinitely for possible future
business use.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the
activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected
developing countries, committee staff said.
    The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade
teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal
agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.
    The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the
U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs --
PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and
upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional
or commercial benefits to interested countries.
    The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the
U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for
International Development and private voluntary organizations
such as U.S. Wheat Associates.
    The bill would require teams within six months to visit
seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India,
Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.
    Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight
countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican
Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.
Other countries could be added to the list.
    Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting
stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by
the committee tomorrow.

    "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help
Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to
do," a senior administration official stated.
    "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"
said another official following an assessment of that country's
latest debt crisis.
    The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the
National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments
and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the
situation.
    In a related development, small regional banks that have
made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American
countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
here tomorrow.
    Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks
late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion
dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.
    Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange
has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service
its debt.
    The official said the interagency meeting was called to
discuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on
(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."
    Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political
discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt
problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from
official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker,
Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.
    Another senior administration official said he was
perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis
with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when
Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.
    "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems
bizarre, just bizarre," the official said.
    One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense,"
and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil,
for which that country was in arrears.
    Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but
wanted to avoid a confrontation.
    The consensus among administration officials seems to be
that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic
economic problems.
    "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would
not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their
economic policy," a senior official added.
    Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker
tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at
the Fed's suggestion.
    "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they
want to say something," one regional bank official said.
    But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of
which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are
dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in
the refinancing of foreign debts.
    The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is
dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest
rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors,
and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve
role in the rescheduling process.

<TITLE>FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total supply of frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department
said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown
sharp gains to date.
    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be
affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on
whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.
have caused injury.
    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year
earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.

<TITLE>SECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for
any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions,
before considering the issue, a staff member said.
    In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on
whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.
    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in
charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House
Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of
tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did
not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday
as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.
    The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and
Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax.
However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had
another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level
rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.
    Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases
of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17
billion dlrs a year, the aide said.
    The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the
proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly
opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities
transactions."
    NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement,
"Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide
and would be counter-productive, making America's securities
industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time
when financial markets are becoming increasingly
international."

<TITLE>U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.
    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

<TITLE>PENNZOIL &lt;PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     HOUSTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 
to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and
that a settlement was "in the best interests of both
companies."
    Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders,
said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent
public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling
the case.
    "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before
and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the
letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make
such clearly untrue statements."
    Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury
judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan
to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two
billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded
to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the
total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.
    Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory
proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.
    "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers,
Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter.
"In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were
proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not
accept."
    The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made
by either Pennzoil or Texaco.
    "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and
demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to
settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to
cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is
clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not
attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and
directors."
    Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and
profits from those assets that have since been sold
"approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion
dlrs for Getty.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
proposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."
    The department said the proposed change is in response to a
petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would
present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help
calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.
    Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less
marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.
    Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged
under the proposal.

<TITLE>HILTON HOTELS &lt;HLT> GIVEN RIGHT TO SUE IRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hilton Hotels Corp said it received
approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service
to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad
Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks.
    That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by
the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,
worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton
attorneys.
    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase
those 6,782,000 shares, the company said.
    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the
Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to
a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints
of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private
foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the
Hilton Corp.
    That act said that a private foundation could not own more
than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over
that figure had to be sold.
    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law
required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of
the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,
Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to the
Hilton lawyers.
    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax
law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block
of stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was
attempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving
the family in control of the corporation.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Government will likely
reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
wheat exports, the department said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ITT &lt;ITT> CONSIDERING STOCK REPURCHASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>ITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a
meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a
repurchase of some shares.
    "We are considering that as a very important way to
increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim
was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market.
    ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from
operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share
a year ago.
    Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares
being studied for repurchase.
    "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988,"
Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any
other time in our history - at least with me."
    Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then
has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired
by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Last year, the company transferred its European
telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie
Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V.
    ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture.
    Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year,
Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small
companies was recently concluded.
    "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the
company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock
transfers.
    Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the
Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany
receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March.
    Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was
considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted
that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of
the sharp appreciation in its stock price.
   
    Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said
diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial
services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in
operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln
dlrs, to 315 mln dlrs, while natural resources increased 10 mln
dlrs, to 73 mln dlrs, the company said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese traders have apparently
sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next
six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling
to sell at current low world prices.
    If the reports are confirmed, China's major export
destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could
increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.
    China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of
corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said.

<TITLE>SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

<TITLE>EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community, EC, sold
75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85
and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing
bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per
tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest
report on Export Markets for U.S grains.
    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during
1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in
the 1985/86 season, it said.
    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat
import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current
forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
domestic production, and says government plans to lower the
guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.
    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of
the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of
U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only
600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

<TITLE>U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY QUESTIONS FUJITSU DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he felt a proposed takeover by Japan's &lt;Fujitsu Ltd> of
U.S.-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, a subsidiary of
Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, should be carefully reviewed.
    He told the Semiconductor Industry Association the deal
would soon be discussed by representatives of several different
government departments.
    The Reagan administration has previously expressed concern
that the proposed takeover would make Fujitsu a powerful part
of the U.S. market for so-called supercomputers at a time when
Japan has not bought any American-made supercomputers.
    In addition, U.S. defense officials have said they were
worried semiconductor technology could be transferred out of
the United States, eventually giving Japanese-made products an
edge in American high-technology markets for defense and other
goods.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker recently told a Senate
committee the proposed takeover would be reviewed by the 
cabinet-level Economic Policy Council.

<TITLE>AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE PLANS AD CAMPAIGN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Stock Exchange (Amex),
which faces stiff competition from the New York Stock Exchange
and the over-the-counter market for listed companies, said it
is launching a 2 mln dlr advertising campaign.
    Amex will advertise on television for the first time, it
said. The campaign also includes print ads.
    "Our entry into television advertising reflects our optimism
for the future. We have proved ourselves a vigorous and
competitive marketplace and we are eager to communicate that
wherever and whenever we can," said Arthurt Levitt Jr., chairman
of the exchange, in a statement.
    The exchange said its advertising campaign, with the theme
"We Extend Your Reach,"  focuses on its role as a diversified
financial exchange trading both stocks and options.
    The television commercials will air on network, cable and
local television stations. The commercials will be broadcast
during March, May, September and November.
    The commercials, titled "The Options Pit," and "An Attractive
Investment," describe Amex's technology advances and
international ties. The print campaign consists of four ads
targeted to specific audiences: listed companies, individual
investors, institutional investors and brokers.
    The Amex currently has a two-way trading link with the
Toronto Exchange and has an agreement with the Europeaon
Options Exchange to trade XMI, the major market index of 20
blue-chip stocks, during European trading hours. The latter is
expected to begin by mid-1987.

American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds
under the legislative checkoff program are running less than
expected.
    The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds
from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm
bill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois and
chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was
collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct,
considerably less than expected.
    "We believe that this indicates good producer support for
the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets,
from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Despite earlier optimistic
indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87
(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct
from the previous year.
    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
period of severe droughts, which at one point required South
Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it
said.
    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing
increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.
    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available
supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the
department said.

<TITLE>CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from
government conservation regulations those farmers who have
rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with
row crops, committee staff said.
    Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly
erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm
program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in
later years.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said
recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less
erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced
strictly row crops.

120,000 dlrs in matching funds will be provided to the meat
board for use in the development of a better market for
processed meats.
    The Meat Export Federation was awarded 50,000 dlrs to
increase the market for chilled and processed U.S. pork in
Japan and Singapore. Retail stores in these two countries will
be providing additional funding for the program.
    A total of 5,000 dlrs for work in encouraging McDonalds to
expand its McRib sandwich to Japan and Singapore was also
awarded to the Meat export Federation.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> BUYBACK SEEN CALMING SHAREHOLDERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street analysts said a share
repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part
an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent
repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.
    "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analyst
Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm of
criticism from people on the institutional side."
    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the
shares in the near term but some had reservations about the
long term effects of the plan.
    "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by
the buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been
hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional
investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five
billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor
Co's &lt;F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis
than that of Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.
    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy
back stock on a large scale.
    The General Motors plan, announced after a board of
directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20
pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.
    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln
class E &lt;GME> and class H &lt;GMH> shares. GM shares closed at
75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's
announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which
trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was
making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.
    "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," said
Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.
    "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming
from unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating is
going to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending.
    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by
going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has
37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for
closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for
workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will be
seen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must be
challenging the union to make it the strike target."
    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM
and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think
the overall plan was "prudent."
    "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in
the stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said.
    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost
reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels
"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the
confines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been telling
clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance
"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive."

    Nippon's move was the result of current exchange rates and
the revaluation of the yen, which "have made the U.S.

Japanese corporations," according to a GTX statement.
    GTX noted that Nippon is expecting sales of 27 billion dlrs

<TITLE>ROCKWELL &lt;ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp
continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,
despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its
business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.
    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared
to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.
    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and
analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's
Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
industrial automation market.
    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
management conference, said first quarter sales for the
Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
on a quarterly basis.
    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
research and development phase of government contracts should
not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
could limit technological innovation.
    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,
we have a very serious problem."
    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage
of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

<TITLE>REAGAN SEEKS MORE AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, seeking to salvage
his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a
major U.S. economic program for the region was working but
needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.
    In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approval
of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central
American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total
economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.
    The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the
administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the
Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed
a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to
offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.
    The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.
    "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the
Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid
to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said.
    Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefed
reporters, said the administration will not try to link
approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with
the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as
some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested.
    He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra
scandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr
allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting
Managua's leftist Sandinista government.
    Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest
fight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed
a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time
in six years -- would back the military request.

<TITLE>SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Swap Dealers
Association has developed the first standard form contract for
use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap
transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's
co-chairman.
    The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected
to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,
he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce
the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said.
    Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of
all new issues eventually become part of either an interest
rate or currency swap.
    An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually
acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's
interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a
floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice
versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains
with the original borrower.
    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of
swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some
portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the
balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient
capital to cushion it.
    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president
of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of
England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later
today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital
standards for counterparties in swaps.
    The standards are part of the recently announced
convergence agreement between the two countries in which
regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements
for institutions.
    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a
"level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market.
    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more
primary capital against swap transactions than is the current
practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to
issuers.
    The issuers might then choose to do business with
lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking
rules.
    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for
swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.
    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he
said.

BellSouth Corp &lt;BLS> unit Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph
Co's decision to postpone the start up of new conversion
assignments at Geonex's Chicago Aerial Survey unit could
negatively affect its fiscal 1987 revenues.
    The company said it had expected higher revenues from the
records conversion work, but it now foresees revenues from
Southern Bell work at about eight mln dlrs, the same level as
last fiscal year.
    Geonex said Southern Bell will let CAS continue work in
progress and it expects to perform mechanized posting and
records conversion for Southern Bell through 1989.
    But, it added that the Southern Bell decision has forced it
to pursue opportunities with other telephone companies and
municipalities to replace the Southern Bell work.

<TITLE>ANDRIESSEN HAILS EC MILK PACT, PROMISES FARM AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community Farm Commissioner
Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy
output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help
farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.
    "We are now in a favourable position to improve the
situation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference.
    The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion
European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of
butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new
stocks from accruing.
    A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in
December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission
proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus
stocks into store.
    After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed
rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public
stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices
were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.
    Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what
he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for
cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming
season.
    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu
package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay
compensation to those who opt for less intensive production
methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections
had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which
he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.
    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older
farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out
of agricultural production or passing it to successors.
    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports to
hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give
full details, but member state aid would be subject to "strict
criteria to avoid distortion of competition."

<TITLE>ITALIAN TREASURY TO ISSUE NEW CERTIFICATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Italian treasury said it will issue
3,000 billion lire of a new type of indexed government paper,
discount certificates (CTS), on March 18.
    Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said at a news conference
the new certificates will be heavily discounted and aimed at
small investors rather than institutions.
    The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the
seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual
yield of 12-month treasury bills.
    Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue
will be 9.66 pct. "The launch of the new certificate has to be
viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as
a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate
issues," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be
certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers
a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and
variable-rate investments.

developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used
at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties.
    Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two
tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant.
    But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car
engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to
10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now, he said.

<TITLE>GREECE PLANS TO REDUCE 1987 FOREIGN BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing
to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986,
and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing
payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris
Halikias, said.
    He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded
immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low
international interest rates in order to make servicing
payments at a lower cost.
    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at
end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.
    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will
go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not
give figures.
    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year
austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current
account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record
3.3 billion in 1985.
    Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a
current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.
    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for
imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.
    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion
dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the
same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs
from 11.4 billion.

     The Chrysler cars are being phased out of production at

    "While we are willing to follow the governor's lead in

<TITLE>B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;British Columbia
Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
four year term.
    The company said the credit facility is extendable under
certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
and completion of formal documentation.
    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
suspended.
    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
    If future dividends are not declared after the April
exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
Columbia.
    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
    B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
company said.
    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

<TITLE>U.S. FACTORY ORDERS FELL 4.0 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>New orders for manufactured goods
fell 8.2 billion dlrs, or 4.0 pct, in January to a seasonally
adjusted 194.5 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    It was the largest one month decrease in orders since a 4.5
pct drop in May, 1980, the department said.
    Excluding defense orders, factory orders fell 5.2 pct in
January after a 4.8 pct December rise.
    The department revised December factory orders upward to an
increase of 1.6 pct from 1.2 pct.
    The new orders decline in January was concentrated in
durable goods, where orders fell 7.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct,
to 103 billion dlrs. The department had estimated on February
26 that January durable goods orders fell 7.5 pct.
    Orders for non-durables in January fell 700 mln dlrs, or
0.8 pct, to 91.5 billion dlrs.
    These figures compared with a December increase in durables
orders of 1.5 pct and a 1.7 pct rise in non-durables.
    Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 49.7 pct, in
January after falling 57.7 pct in December, the department
said.
    Orders for non-defense capital goods fell 17 pct in January
after increasing by 5.7 pct in December.
    Within major industry categories, orders declines were
widespread, the department said.
    Electrical machinery orders fell 19.8 pct, or 3.6 billion
dlrs, after a 9.5 pct increase in December.
    Primary metals orders fell 17.7 pct, or 1.9 billion dlrs,
following a 12.1 pct increase in December.
    Orders for transportation equipment were down 4.5 pct in
January after falling 0.6 pct in December.
    Orders for non-electrical machinery were down 6.1 pct in
January after falling by 7.1 pct in December.
    Manufacturers' shipments fell 3.8 pct, or 7.8 billion dlrs,
to a total 196.7 billion dlrs. The department said it was the
largest one month fall in shipments since a 5.1 pct drop in
December, 1974.
    Unfilled orders fell 0.6 pct, or 2.2 billion dlrs, to a
total 363 billion dlrs.
    Factory inventories in January rose 0.5 pct, or 1.5 billion
dlrs, to 277.0 billion dlrs, only the second rise since July
and concentrated in finished goods.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> HAS 4TH QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
    The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
    Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
    The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
    Williams said the charges in the current year were related
to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
for future stability and growth in earnings.
    Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
    Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela plans to have a public sector
foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the
present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,
public finances director Jorge Marcano said.
    He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion
dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable
amount which will assist in development plans.
    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank
advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling
accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8
pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.
    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said
he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do
with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision
to suspend interest payments.
    "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the
U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften
their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil
announcement came later," he said.
    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,
objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact
with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before
Venezuela's.
    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors
seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,
which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We
cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new
agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he
said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.
    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign
borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral
agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next
two years. According to the restructured accord, this would
work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>SENATE'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Banking Committee chairman
William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate
takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.
    "At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk
arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider
precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing
in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk
arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing
on corporate takeovers.
    "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a
complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and
investment banking," Proxmire said.
    He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts
were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives
who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have
become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial
buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman
David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to
continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion
International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added.

<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
    "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he
said.
     "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
which have a similar productive structure," he said.
    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
international trade fairs.
    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
25 billion peseta grant.
    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.
    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
turning their backs on foreign markets.
    "They have to realise their share of the home market is
going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign
companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and
it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

<TITLE>COMMISSION REPORT WARNS ON EC FINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community is close to
bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report.
    In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC
finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a
budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on
the brink of bankruptcy."
    The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a
major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign
ministers are due to start debating next month.
    The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the
"considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions
they themselves have taken.
    "Budgetary practices have emerged which fictitiously
disguise the real impact of expenditure decisions," it said.
Adding that such practices were unacceptable.
    It put the EC's accumulated liabilities at the end of last
year at 12.2 billion European Currency Units and estimated
these would rise by a further five billion Ecus this year.

<DATELINE>    MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Digital Equipment said it is
taking several initiatives designed to make it easier and more
cost effecive for customers to purchase and use its products
and services.
    The company also said it is introducing three new mid-range
VAX systems.
    Digital stated the moves "further strengthened its
leadership position in the computer industry."
    The company said it also adjusted prices acrossall product
lines to more accurately reflect performance and customer value.
    Digital said the new products -- the VAX 8250, VAX 8350 and
VZX 8530 systems -- replace earlier models and provide up to 40
pct increased performance.
    It said the new "systems reflect Digital's ability to
sustain its present leadership in integrated, networked
systems."
    Effective today, the company said, it is adopting new
business practices to remain responsive to the needs of
customers and the rapidly changing marketplace, specifically
the trend towards distributed, networked operations.

hardware, including VAX and PDP systems, all options and
peripherals. In addition, customers can select to extend their

<TITLE>VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - Vereins- </DATELINE><BODY>und Westbank AG &lt;VHBG.F> plans
to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of
financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer
Luckey said.
    He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a
branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
opening a branch in London.
    Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
    The group balance sheet, including for the first time
VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
billion marks, Luckey said.
    The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.
    Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
account contributed to record operating profits.
    Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
156.7 mln, Luckey said.
    Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in
West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.
    The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct
of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.
    The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986,
and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE CONCERNED ABOUT KOREAN/TAIWAN DEFICITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of Commerce Malcolm
Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade
deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an
adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of
improvement.
    Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry
advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under
discussion with those countries.
    "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we
probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large
surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.
    In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters,
Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover
by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.
    He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S.
companies into the giant computer business while at the same
time attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does
major computer business in the U.S. market.
    Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful
that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by
the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,
remained unresolved.

<TITLE>PS NEW MEXICO &lt;PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Public Service Co of New
Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution
system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln
dlrs.
    The utility said it advised a customer task force this is
one restructuring alternative being considered for the
company's electric business.
    The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's
overall initiative in response to several goals announced by
New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained.
    Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its
reorganization concept would be to separate the company's
electric utility operation into independent generation and
distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted
35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.
    Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a
variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes
"the concept may well have an application in the utility
business and intend to investigate it fully."
    The generation company would provide projected power needs
of the distribution entity under a 30-year "power security
agreement" which would have a federally regulated rate
structure, the company said.
    Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could
provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility
companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company
approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986.
    This holding company would be the general partner of the
limited partnership, the company said.
    The company said its limited partnership concept was
presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov.
Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.
    It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an
alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a
lower overall cost of capital.
    Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNM
critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may
administration in achieving" adding the goals include immediate
rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation
of business expansion.
    The company told the task force the new distribution
company, under the limited partnership alternative or
otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state
regulators.
    PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be
owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its
rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and
transmission services. The generation company would have no
retail customers.
    PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan
with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would
also be needed by FERC.

<TITLE>CASTLE AND COOKE &lt;CKE> TAKES FOURTH QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Castle and Cooke Inc said it would
take a fourth quarter after-tax loss of 33.9 mln dlrs from the
previously reported sale of its Flexi-Van container leasing
business to Itel Corp &lt;ITEL> for about 215 mln dlrs.
    Earlier, the company reported a loss for the fourth quarter
ended January 3 of 31.9 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, compared
with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's
fourth quarter.
    For the year, however, the diversified holding company
reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share,
versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.
    David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
"Both our food business and our real estate operations
increased their earnings during the year (1986)."
    But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by
oversupplies.
    The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly
executive vice president,  has been named president and chief
operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has
been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.

<TITLE>U.K. ONE BILLION STG BOND ISSUE EXHAUSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion stg issue of nine pct
Exchequer stock due 2002 which became available for trading
only this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on the
U.K. Government bond market, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating
as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg
pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold
out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds
started trading this morning at 20 stg pct.
    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand
throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.
    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from
both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and
the U.S.
    Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax
to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for
the market in general had generated foreign buying.
    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it
was announced and dealers said that even first thing this
morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable
existing stocks.
    However, sterling's continuing firm performance had
prompted interest in the tap right at the outset.
    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid
structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of
the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred
a substantial gearing element.
    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought
the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the
market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total
purchase price was tied up initially.

<TITLE>COMMISSION REPORT WARNS ON EC FINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community is close to
bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report.
    In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC
finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a
budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on
the brink of bankruptcy."
    The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a
major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign
ministers are due to start debating next month.
    The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the
"considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions
they themselves have taken.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC Executive Commission has backed
a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline
in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.
    It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC
states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead
at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC
ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban.
"It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.
    But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage
the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas
stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to
stock.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the
exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and
trigger inflation.
    He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that
the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to
reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained
much the same.
    But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could
be inflation in the United States.
    Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause
economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that
would not be in America's interest because it would close those
markets to U.S. goods.

<TITLE>LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Feizal Samath, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leaf disease affecting seven pct of
Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and
raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and
researchers told Reuters.
    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber
Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus
"corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the
leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.
    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the
crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000
tonnes.
    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber
clones if no immediate action is taken.
    "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees
seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use
chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.
    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at
Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the
fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State
Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber
land with the balance belonging to small private producers with
a total of 145,600 hectares.
    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research
Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for
planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these
clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older
PBX Malaysian clones.
    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided
to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be
treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.
    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week
but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there
is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman
for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.
    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about
four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe
one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this
week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same
period.
    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average
of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in
December because of wintering in early February in producing
areas.
    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with
the supply position showing improvements.
    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last
month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.
    "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,
meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of
the rubber we already had," one buyer said.
    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and
speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals
aggravated the problem.
    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter
closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would
ease further.
    They said another problem that could hit the industry is
the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains

shortages," one official said.
    "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR MAKERS HOPE TO PROFIT FROM WEAK DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Geneva Motor Show, the first major
car show of the year, opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers
hoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the
cheap dollar, automobile executives said.
    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and General Motors Corp &lt;GM> sell cars in
Europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM
also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European
export.
     Now Chrysler Corp &lt;C> is saying it will begin exporting
American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a
market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy.
    Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany
manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last
year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European
market.
    Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and
Britain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about
1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.
    James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped
for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made
vehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North
American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. "A
low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters.
    Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his
projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million
and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added.
    That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500
North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs.
    Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all
of its cars sold on the continent.  But Walter Hayes, vice
president of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a
large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. 
"We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe
is inevitably a small volume market."
    Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to
European environmental specifications cut into profit margins.
    But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said
the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. 
"After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to
re-enter the European market," he said.
    "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here
because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of
the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the
dollar."

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.
    "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be
refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann
Remsperger.
    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money
market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest
rates, he said.

<TEXT TYPE="UNPROC">&#2;
MIDLAND RIGHTS ISSUE STILL EXPECTED SAY ANALYSTS LONDON, March
4 - Midland Bank Plc's &lt;MDBL.L> 1986 results suggest its shares
show further recovery potential, although a rights issue is
still expected in the next few months, banking analysts said.
    A rights issue of the order of 400 mln stg is seen, perhaps
in June if there is no U.K. General election, they added.
Midland Chairman Sir Donald Barron would not comment on the
rights question at a news conference.
    Earlier, Midland reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 434 mln
stg, up from 351 mln the previous year, in line with market
forecasts, dealers said. Midland shares were up 14p at 633p.
    Midland said its 1986 results included Crocker National
Corp for the first five months, prior to its sale last May. If
results were restated excluding distortions stemming from the
Crocker sale they would show a 1986 pre-tax profit of 432 mln
stg compared with 366 mln, it said.
    Barron said that after the sale of Crocker and
restructuring during the last two years the group had "put the
past firmly behind us in 1986" and was now "focusing our
considerable resources on the exciting opportunities ahead."
    Chief Executive Sir Kit McMahon said U.K. Operations were
the main source of profits, with 83 pct or 434 mln stg.
    Both net interest income and non-interest income were ahead
of 1985.
    A key component in domestic asset growth was a 96 pct rise
in Midland's mortgage portfolio to 2.7 billion stg, comfortably
exceeding a 2.5 billion target, McMahon said. Overall sterling
advances rose over 18 pct to 20.2 billion stg.
    Pre-tax profits in investment banking rose 27 pct to 65 mln
stg despite the heavy start-up and integration costs. However,
this included the group's full range of activities in this area
from its treasuries operations to its merchant bank to
securities and gilts trading activities.
    No breakdown of this figure was given although McMahon said
venture capital activites contributed 17 mln stg to profit. He
said the group's gilts trading was operating at a profit
although its securities activities were not, but would give no
further details.
    International banking profits rose 80 pct to 54 mln stg,
benefitting from past restructuring and good performances from
European subsidiaries.
    Crocker and the Bracton subsidiary created by Midland to
work out Crocker's problem loans made a loss of 44 mln stg in
1986 against a 35 mln loss in 1985.
    Bracton assets now stood at 300 mln dlrs and had been fully
provisioned, McMahon said.
    Charges for bad and doubtful debts declined to 357 mln stg
against 431 mln the previous year and the bank said that
excluding Crocker, it would have been 320 mln.
    McMahon noted that total cover for bad debts had increased
to three pct of lendings in 1986 from 2.6 pct in 1985. He said
no evidence of increasing consumer credit delinquency and fewer
U.K. Corporate defaults allowed for a lower domestic debt
charge in 1986.
    McMahon said Midland's exposure in South America remained
unchanged on 1985, with 1.4 billion stg outstanding to Brazil,
1.3 billion to Mexico and 600 mln to Argentina.
    Following the lead of the other four major U.K. Banks
Midland moved charges against lending to rescheduling countries
from general to specific provisions.
    This was the key factor behind a reduction in its tax rate
to just under 40 pct in 1986 from 59 pct in 1985, McMahon said.
    One major problem still to be faced by the bank was to
further reduce its cost/income ratio, which is still well above
its competitors at 72 pct, he added.

<TITLE>GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cost of living in West Germany will
likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the
HWWA economic research institute said.
    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
first part of 1987.
    Provisional inflation figures for February released last
week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
against the same month a year earlier.
    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SAYS S. AMERICAN DEBTORS STILL TALKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin American debtor nations are
still willing to negotiate on their debts, World Bank director
for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said.
    In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily,
Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador
and Brazil to suspend some interest payments, these nations
were still willing to talk constructively about their debts.
    "These countries are still prepared to negotiate, and the
instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means
to deal with the crisis over time," Steckhan said.
    Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to
meet their debt payments, especially Latin American countries,
Steckhan said.
    Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six
pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984,
despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper.
    Mexico, hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in
world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third
in 1986, the highest growth rate in its post-war history.
    The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to
4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board voted
unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
assets.
    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
today by the Bank of England.
    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
contracts and similar financial instruments.
    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
that banks would be required to take into account in
calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
maintain.
    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
    The current exposure would be measured by the
mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
replacement cost.
    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
asset.
    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
the principal participants in these types of activities.
    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
compete in world financial markets.
    However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in
such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
profiles of some banking organizations."
    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts traded on organized exchanges.
    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
rules.

    The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out
of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month
against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to
western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously.
    Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln
tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas
dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.
    U.K./Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91

<TITLE>EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of
social and structural measures agreed early today by European
Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers
for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission
sources said.
    The ministers agreed that under this "extensification"
scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut
output of specific products by at least 20 pct.
    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and
wine, they added.
    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by
reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their
number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,
farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity
for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.
    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but
will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on
the production they forego.
    The sources said the package also contains provisions for
payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting
or improving the environment.
    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured
farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such
allowances are available only for livestock.
    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into
alternative farming techniques, the sources added.
    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen
said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports for
relatively poor farmers.
    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state
aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of
competition."
    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a
difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus
production.
    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night
proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55
or over who gave up production. Those who took their land
completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to
their heirs, would have received more generous payments.
    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised
proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme
agreed.

<TITLE>NATIONAL FUEL &lt;NFG> PROPOSES ARGO REORGANIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Fuel Gas Co said it has
proposed a plan of reorganization for &lt;Argo Petroleum Corp>.
    The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources
Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing
and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing
Argo's debt to Seneca.
    The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr
advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said.
    National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a
term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's
unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal
secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling
about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs.
    National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would
allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new
company for its existing shareholders.
    National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing
secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing
note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas
properties.
    Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct
owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly
owned properties.
    In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's
existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr
revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the
venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said.
    It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets
not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new
corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the
new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will
receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange
for their claims against the company.

<TITLE>U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.
    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
agreed in January between the two central banks to make
commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar
standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.
    "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And
U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."
     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
fluctuations until the contract matures.
    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance
sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
plans showed.
    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.
And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national
government agencies, the proposals showed.
    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot
foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and
options exchanges.
    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England
were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate
multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single
agreement to create one single payments stream.
    It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain
circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their
further development and implementation," and said some of the
current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

the island, the government announced.
    Financing from the compensatory facility is meant to offset
losses in export earnings and does not carry the same
conditions attached to other IMF loans.
    The government will also receive 85 mln SDRs under a new
stand-by agreement. The new credit agreement signed in January
was originally to last 15 months, but the government now says
it will go for one year beginning this month.

survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be
known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.
    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive
ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman
Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.
    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly
melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should
not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be
damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots
may be exposed to night frosts.

<TITLE>U.S. PRESENTS MOSCOW WITH DRAFT MISSILE TREATY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States today handed Soviet
arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all
superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slash
such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side.
    Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussing
medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a
full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table.
    The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish
"Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces
elsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday.
    The developments have been described by many disarmament
experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since
they resumed arms control talks in March 1985.
    Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half
hour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Soviet
team on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov.
    He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to be
because we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities."
    The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction
- of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over five
years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic
warheads on each side, Glitman added.
    In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20's
and 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles.

<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp
said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common
stock split.
    The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's
Great Southern Paper division operations.
    In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the
shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the
authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the
company said.
    The company said it will propose an increase in its
dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June
payment.
    The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts
per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate
of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a
dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
higher than the current rate.
    The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct
last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock
split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.
    As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN
common stock outstanding, according to the company.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc
has agreed to reduce its rates 3.1 pct next month and write-off
50 mln dlrs of deferred debits, New York Governor Mario M.
Cuomo said.
    He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in
annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel
charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will
reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs
per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases
until at least April 1990.
    Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must
be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was
negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public
Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General,
the City of New York and several other parties.
    He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric
rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years.
    As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had
a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since
March 1983," he added.
    Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal
taxes and lower interest rates.
    The utility said another factor includes improved economic
conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased
sales.
    It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an
average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984."

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Failure of talks on re-establishing
International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week
may put political pressure on the United States, particularly
the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is
unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.
    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head
of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his
return from London that the United States is willing to resume
the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.
    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in
discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,
proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the
market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.
customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
with any future coffee quotas.
    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the
coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London
talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."
    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee
policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,
to soften the consumer position.
    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will
kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
consumers," said one U.S. official.
    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said
Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
who differed with the major producers in London.
    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin
American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in
the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.
officials said.
    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee
policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.
officials said.
    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia
at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica
joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
objective criteria.
    There is a strong feeling among some in the State
Department that the United States should continue to support
the splinter group of producers who have taken the
politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective
criteria question, U.S. officials said.
    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
some pressure to reassess positions.
    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the
Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on
the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at
times qualified and there is some concern that the European
Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and
other African producers during the talks.
    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,
although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.
    While political manuevering by small producers and
consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the
key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.
    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the
failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

<TITLE>IBM &lt;IBM> DEMONSTRATES NEW CHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business
Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer
chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light
into electrical signals that translate into computer language.
    IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip
reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second.
    The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical
signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits.
    IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient
in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to
be an ideal material for the light-based computer
communications expected to be widely used in the future.
    The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination
of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector
and transistor circuitry close together.
    Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the
receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and
distortion, it said.

<TITLE>TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Torrential rains throughout
Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to
soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
May.
    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,
with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10
and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40
mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.
    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.
    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
pct of total planted area.
    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
of 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures
put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.
    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is
expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to
13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
planted.
    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
supported by the Reagan administration and would save
approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
to plant under the decoupling scheme.
    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
deficiency payments.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
further before deciding how he would vote on it.

met his Swiss counterpart Otto Stich, Swiss Economics Minister
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and National Bank President Pierre
Languetin on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country's
debt problems.
    Funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken him
to London, Paris and Bonn, was aimed at explaining his
country's stance to governments. Talks with commercial banks
will take place at a later date.
    Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end
Brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.
    Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to
its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest
recession in his country's history, he added.
    He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more
flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and
it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.
    A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made no
demands.
    Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was
unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazil
first.

<TITLE>GATT TO RULE ON U.S. CUSTOMS USER FEE DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world trade body GATT has decided to
set up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada and
the European Community to a customs user fee imposed by the
U.S. Government, a GATT spokesman said.
    Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax on
an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is
illegal under GATT rules.
    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by
the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does
not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many
other countries.
    Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine
the dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it.
    In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a large
number of developing countries, attacked the "textile and
apparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress last
February 19.
    Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is
"blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing about
the bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent with
either the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)."
    If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "it
would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of
world trade in textiles."
    GATT's council also decided to set up a working party to
study China's application for full GATT membership. The group
is due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15.

regime agreed last night is too complicated and may destabilise
prices, Abele Kuypers, secretary of the dairy section of the
Dutch farmers' organisation Landbouwschap said.
    He welcomed the decision to write off existing stocks of
butter and skimmed milk powder and agreed there should be some
reduction of pressure on stores but said the Landbouwschap was
unhappy at the mechanism for limiting sales to intervention
except when prices fall too far.
    But Harm Schelhaas, chairman of the Milk Commodity Board,
was less worried by the new dairy regime. Dutch milk output
will fall by up to six pct this year due to the new regime, but
cheese output should rise, he said.

<TITLE>INDIA BUYS UP TO 10 CARGOES SUGAR - TRADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>India bought up to 10 cargoes of white
sugar at a buying tender today which originally called for just
two to three cargoes of March/April shipment, traders said.
    London trader E D and F Man said it sold two cargoes at 233
dlrs a tonne CIF for March/April shipment with an option to
sell an additional two cargoes at the same price.
    Traders said at least one other international trader made a
similar contract while a French house sold two cargoes at an
outright price of 233 dlrs CIF without the option. This brought
total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders
having options to sell another four.

<TITLE>TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
Organisation said.
    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
wholesale index last year.
    This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the
economic management will have to be careful," he said.
    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
which is central to the government's economic planning, said
Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
    "We must alleviate the current account substantially to
sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
over the last five years," he added.
    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
would look better if inflation were lower and the current
account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
    "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
improvement in the current account deficit," he said.
    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
also to blame for the high deficits.
    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
    "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he
said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
5.6 pct in 1986.
    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
exports, and production incentives were being considered.
    "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
local private capital come more into play as far as
manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.
    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
currency is only partially convertible.

<TITLE>ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MICHAEL FITZPATRICK, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year," Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"
Guerard said.

<TITLE>REAGAN DENOUNCES REPORTS OF WIFE'S ROLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan angrily denounced
press reports that his wife, Nancy, is running the government
as "despicable fiction."
    He said the reports had "touched a nerve."
    Reagan made the comments at a photo session with William
Webster, his nominee as head of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
    The president and Mrs Reagan celebrate their 35th wedding
anniversary today as Reagan prepares to make an address to the
nation on the Iran-contra scandal tonight.
    When a reporter asked about Mrs Reagan's role in
government, Reagan replied: "I think this is being bandied by
the press. That is fiction and I think it is despicable
fiction.  And a lot of people ought to be ashamed of
themselves."
    Pressed for further comment, Reagan said, "The idea that she
is involved in governmental decisions and so forth... and being
a kind of a dragon lady, there is nothing to that."
    Reagan flatly denied that that his wife had had a role in
the departure from the White House last Friday of Reagan's
chief of staff, Donald Regan, as has been widely reported.
    Regan's successor, former senator Howard Baker, was in the
room as Reagan made his comments.

<TITLE>IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government daily Izvestia said a
considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded
and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will
not be easy to fulfil.
    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable
part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates
extra effort in the fields in spring."
    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of
winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.
    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has
said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct
of the total winter crop and would be the second highest
winterkill in 10 years.
    "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes
of grain is not simple," Izvestia said.
    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large
parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the
Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as
minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA'S CREDITORS SAID DIVIDED OVER DEBT ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank director Daniel Marx
said Argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country's
request for rescheduling its foreign debt.
    "There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an
agreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a local
radio station in a telephone interview from New York.
    Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its
50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in
interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.
    Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating team
holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.
    Marx said the talks should not drag on. "If Venezuela and
Mexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours)
in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said.
    Economy ministry sources said the steering committee was
expected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that made
by Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn at the start of the
talks between the two parties.
    Argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four
pct growth targets in 1987. It also wants lower interest rates
on its foreign debt. The United States said last week it would
support a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for Argentina.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted
alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and
1985 from a federal conservation requirement.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore
equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm
program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without
interrupting the plantings with a row crop.
    An official from a leading conservation group, who asked
not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate
first action" because it could lead to the exemption of
potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,
established under the 1985 farm bill.

<DATELINE>    GREAT NECK, N.Y., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>AVX Corp said it has entered a
two mln dlr settlement with the U.S. government and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to pay for damage claims against
the company for contaminating the New Bedford, Mass., harbor
with polychloride biphenyls (PCBs).
    As part of the agreement, AVX said the government and
Massachusetts have agreed to release it from further
liabilities for polluting the harbor.
    AVX said it has fully provided for the settlement's cost in
its 1986 financial statements.
    AVX, a multilayer ceramic capacitor producer, said the
government had estimated damages to the harbor at about 50 mln
dlrs.
    But, it added, the government, the state and the
Environmental Protection Agency are still awaiting the
completion of studies to determine whether they will recommend
a cleanup and what it will cost.
    The studies will be completed next year, AVX added.
    AVX said it is one of five defendents involved in the
pollution litigation.
    AVX said it is also engaged in litigation with its insurers
to determine the applicability and the amount of coverage
available to indemnify the company for payment of the the two
mln dlr settlement or its share of the cleanup, if any.

<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street traders said the stock of
Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.
    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans," he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

<TITLE>FRENCH WHEAT EXPORTS TO EC FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French soft wheat exports to other
European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in
the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January
compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French
Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.
    According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were
Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86
period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the
Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes
(919,337).
    British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this
period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and
January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800
tonnes, ONIC figures showed.
    But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes
against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal
bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.
    ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community
countries was due to British competition.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

<TITLE>S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4, - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs
trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the
country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.
companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.
     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and
denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.
    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year
South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a
record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr
deficit with Japan.
    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission
is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.
companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred
purchases from Japanese sources."
    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are
"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."
    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.
agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in
that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of
cotton" from the U.S.
    He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American
market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"
considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and
spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.

<DATELINE>    Detroit, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Range Rover of North America Inc, a
subsidiary of the British Land Rover Group, said it would begin
selling the luxury utility vehicles in the United States March
16 at a suggested retail price of 30,825 dlrs.
    Range Rover executives told Reuters after a press
conference they expect to generate 80 mln dlrs in revenues this
year, but that the U.S. venture is not expected to become
profitable until 1989.
    The executives said they expect to sell 3,000 of the
vehicles this year from an initial network of 37 dealers, which
will be gradually expanded to 65 within a year.
    Range Rover's project, aimed at buyers with household
incomes above 100,000 dlrs annually, is the culmination of a
four-year effort by Land Rover Group to introduce the
British-build vehicle in the U.S. market.
    The executives said the only option to be offered with the
vehicles will be a leather upholstery package priced at 1,025
dlrs.

<TITLE>CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    But federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling GATT Council deferred a
decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
officially known as semiconductors.
    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,
Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC
complaint during the heated Council debate.
    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael
Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were
unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp staged an explosive
rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value."
    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February
sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. The numbers include imports.
    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
transition year for GM," he said.
    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
important."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Healthy growth in corporate profits and in
consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its
hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the
core, economists polled by Reuters said.
    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace
exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between
corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative
economic model promises little but slower growth, they said.
    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn
will cut sales and further reduce profits.
    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved
terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic
demand grow steadily.
    However, this would happen only if household spending
increased in line with the value of real financial assets due
to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as
profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from
exports.
    "No clear sign of such developments has so far been
evidenced," the central bank said.
    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth
will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved
sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips
and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct
while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price
margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies
did not pass that advantage on to the consumer.
    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the
fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in
consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of
trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.
    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will
protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek
more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic
competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.
Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.
    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren
confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.
    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost
80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production
volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,
said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.
    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting
unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors
(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down
wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears
unemployment could soon double from three pct now.
    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt
sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual
financial security could be even more damaging.
    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what
amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to
buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.
    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied
bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.
    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than
the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a
poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the
resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,
and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.
    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80
pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly
ageing population and minimal social security and its workers
fear poverty in their old age.
    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's
reflationary strategies are severely limited.
    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small
supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive
without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less
than excited at the results.
    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.
    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically
impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate
at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.
    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some
kind of deposit, official figures show.
    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while
firms are planning cuts in capital investment.
    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land
prices are the only current results of high liquidity.
    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political
analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big
election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price
inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a
sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Offshore oil industry has
suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not
sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy
Alick Buchanan-Smith said.
    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been
most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy
committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still
spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.
    He added that a report by the manpower services committee
which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should
be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.
    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of
8.50
dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the
previous November.
    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last
December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15
dlrs.
    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting
OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as
well as an oil-producing nation.

<TITLE>TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told
journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
subsidiary before stock depreciation.
    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
billion loss in 1985.
    But its net loss last year, taking account of that
depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent
distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud
said.
    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
francs, he said.
    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a
good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

firms to challenge Japan's presence in the global semiconductor
market was announced by the Semiconductor Industry Association.
    The initiative will be funded by U.S. manufacturers to
develop the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing
technologies, the association said at a news conference.
    Government participation and financial support will also be
sought for the consortium called SEMATECH, for "semiconductor
manufacturing technology." 
    "We can continue to sit back and watch the Japanese target
and assualt yet another critical U.S. industry. Or we can get
in gear and do what is necessary to repell this attack," said
Irwin Federman, chief executive officer of Monolithic Memories
Inc.
    He said the objective of SEMATECH, a non profit
corporation, was to maintain leadership in an industry that was
vital to the U.S. economy and national security.
    The plan was for SEMATECH to establish a facility at
various manufacturers and equipment suppliers to pioneer
advanced manufacturing techniques for semiconductors.

<TITLE>ANALYST REITERATES BUY ON SOME DRUG STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch and Co analyst Richard
Vietor said he reiterated a buy recommendation on several drug
stocks today.
    The stocks were Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY>, which rose 2-1/4 to
101, Schering-Plough Corp &lt;SGP> 2-7/8 to 97 and Syntex Corp
&lt;SYN> 1-3/8 to 82. Vietor described these stocks as a "middle
group" of performers.
    Vietor said the prices of these stocks, "look pretty cheap
relative to the leading performers in the drug group, such as
Upjohn Co &lt;UPJ>, Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, and Squibb Corp
&lt;SQB>."
    Vietor said he also mentioned Pfizer Inc &lt;PFE> up two to
72-3/4 and Warner-Lambert Co &lt;WLA> up 1-1/2 to 74-1/2 as being
in the middle group. But he did not recommend those stocks,
which he rates as neutral.

<TITLE>TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUSTIN, Texas, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Railroad Commissioner James
Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent
said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way."
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria
blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last
week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export
quotas.
    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible
than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political
factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria
told Reuters in an interview.
    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other
for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export
quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful
outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent
attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it
impossible.
    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria
said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and
political consequences, not necessarily for a country like
Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for
some African countries.
    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively
high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.
    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500
mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which
traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export
revenue.
    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400
mln dlrs from 1986.
    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the
start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln
bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.

<TITLE>PACTEL &lt;PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
Bell operating company.
    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business."
    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"
he said.

<TITLE>SENATE COMMITTEE ISSUES REVISED BANK BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Banking Committee has
issued a revised draft bank regulation bill which would permit
so-called non-bank banks to continue all their activities in
progress as of March 5, 1987.
    The bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider
tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new
activities after March 5, increase the number of their
locations or cross-market products or services not permissible
for bank holding companies.
    The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank
securities or insurance activities.
    The bill would establish a financing corporation to raise
7.5 billion dlrs for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange
out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln
dlrs or more in assets.
    Committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, had wanted to
ban all non-bank bank activities started after July 1, 1983,
but opposition from other committee members forced him to
revise the legislation.
    The House Banking committee is also considering bank
regulation legislation, but is waiting for the Senate to act.

British and German interests to establish a shipping line that
will handle 40 pct of the country's external trade, sources
close to the deal said.
    The state-owned Kenya Ports Authority, KPA, signed an
agreement with the Hamburg-based shipping line Unimar
Seetransport to establish the Kenya National Shipping line,
with an initial capital of 100 mln shillings, sources said. KPA
will hold 70 pct of the shares in the new company.
    The line will initially charter vessels to operate services
between Mombasa and the main ports of industrial Europe, but
may eventually build or buy its own ships. The sources said it
would aim to carry a large part of Kenya's coffee and tea
exports and oil and fertiliser imports.

<TITLE>NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking
banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said
that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
reserves twice for the same risk.
    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
proposals.
    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick
de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     "One problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank
official.

<TITLE>SPEAKES SAYS HE, REAGAN MISLED PUBLIC UNWITTINGLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said he and President Reagan misled the public
unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they
themselves were misled by others.
    In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting the
defensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early
attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he
expected when the president addressed the nation tonight.
    "When we went into those press conferences and that
nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story
broke, the president did not have the proper information,"
Speakes said.
    "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, the
president and I misled the public, to a certain extent."
    "We were badly served by the people that were involved in
the Iranian crisis and running the show."
    Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter;
and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North.
    Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of
events "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts
..."
    McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter had
doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize
Reagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as part
of an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 news
conference.

<TITLE>BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive
use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

<TITLE>DYNAMICS CORP &lt;DYA> IN SETTLEMENT WITH CTS &lt;CTS></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GREENWICH, Conn., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dynamics Corp of America said
it has reached an agreement with CTS Corp resolving all
differences between the two companies.
    It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board
committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all
of CTS.
    Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding
stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more
than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the
company's 1987 annual meeting.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders
vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying
Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated
costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common
at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the
outstanding stock.
    Dynamics said the price of stock under the option,
exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price
for the stock for the five days ending March two.
    Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the
additional title of President. Former President Robert D.
Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial
Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven
members for eight with the remaining four members of the
current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new
directors.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
directors have postponed action on a membership petition
calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner
told Reuters.
    Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular
board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of
a special committee that has been studying trading conditions
in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six
months.
    "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said.
    Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings
of the special S and P committee, which is considering some
type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures.
    Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange
member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own
account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity
for traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at more
favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner
said he expects the special committee to report its findings
late next week and the board to act when those findings are
presented.
    In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a
ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already
unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P
500 futures at a prior meeting.
    The change was withheld, however, at the request of the
special committee after a study was released and the committee
felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively,
Sandner said.
    Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on
dual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to
a ban on dual trading."
    Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special
study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500
futures and options on futures.
    In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is
also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for
electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures
and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P
trading pit, Melamed said.
    Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special
committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are
usually approved by the exchange board of directors.

<TITLE>RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for renewal of the
five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this
point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.
    The current trade imbalance between the United States and
the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased
world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement
next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.
    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.
    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than
when the first agreement was signed in 1975.
    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have
indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as
attractive for both sides as it once was.
    "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,
but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with
prices," Melnikov said.
    "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future
about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will
happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.
    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet
government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal
of the agreement.
    "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or
ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp's Chrysler Motors Corp
said it will spend 367 mln dlrs at its Belvidere, Ill.,
assembly plant to modernize the facility.
    Chrysler said the plant, its sixth to undergo extensive
modernization, will be shut down for model changeover starting
March five.
    Some 2,800 workers of the plant's 3,300 hourly employees
will be temporarily laid off for 18 weeks from March five
through mid-July. The other 500 workers will remain at the
plant in maintenance, retooling and material handling jobs.
    Chrysler said the 367 mln dlr expenditure is part of a 720
mln dlr development program at Belvidere.
    The rest of the money will be spent developing Chrysler's
New York and Dodge Dynasty four-door sedans to be built at the
plant.
    Modernization of the 22-year-old facility is part of
Chrysler's five-year, 12.5 billion dlr company-wide program to
bring its manufacturing operations up to current standards.
    Chrysler said it will increase the number of robots at
Belvidere to 244 from 41. The robots will be used in welding,
material handling and sealing.
    Chrysler will also help retrain the plant's workforce. The
State of Illinois has committeed 10 mln dlrs in training funds
to the project.
    When the plant reopens in July, Chrysler workers will have
completed more than five mln classrom and on-the-job hours in
retraining, the company said.
    The July restart will be on a single-shift basis.
Second-shift production will start this fall.

acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's
shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to
be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's
offer.
    TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of
Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an
application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its
purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the
stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.
    TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for
Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> it believes that USAir's shareholders
would prefer a cash merger proposal for USAir over its proposed
acquisition of Piedmont.
    TWA said, however, it also would be interested in
discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.
    TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming
the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to
shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a
majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve
its proposed move.
    Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due
diligence review of USAir.
    TWA said it has not yet had an opportunity to obtain the
necessary financing for the deal, but added it is confident
that it will get it.

<TITLE>REAGAN IRAN SPEECH SAID TO ADMIT NEED FOR CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, fighting to recover
politically from the Iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledge
in a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to change
his ways, administration officials said.
    "It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say he
accepts the need for change," said an official who asked not to
be identified. "I think the president wants to give his side of
the story."
    The official said Reagan would tell the public what he is
doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching
Tower commission report on the origins of the scandal.
    It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of many
of his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policy
was wrong and he personally made some mistakes.
    Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say
he erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't give
you any advance on what he intends to say in that area."
    He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and
that Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalized
White House that will pursue an active foreign policy."
    "The president will discuss the Tower board report and its
recommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in the
structure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goals
for the next two years," the spokesman said.
    To date, Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms to
Iran and conceded only there were errors in implementation.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speech
might be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.
    "It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us on
another course. It's hard to do that, he probably won't be able
to do it," Dole told reporters.

assigned to Public Service Electric and Gas Company's fixed
income securities valued at a total of 3.44 billion dlrs.
    The company's 2.61 billion dlrs in first mortgage bonds
were downgraded to DP-4 (low AA) from DP-3 (middle AA). The
ratings on its debentures and preferred stock valued at 213 mln
and 619 mln dlrs, respectively, were lowered to DP-5 (high A)
from DP-4.
    Duff and Phelps said the utility's debt ratings were

    "This order included highly stringent performance standards
for the company's five nuclear plants," the ratings agency
said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The former chairman of Peoples National
Bank of Rockland County, N.Y., pleaded guilty to charges of
bribery and income tax evasion.
    Leonard Slutsky, 41, faces up to five years in prison on

bank was declared insolvent in September, 1984.
    Another former official of the bank, Samuel Yonnone, 37,
pled guilty today to conspiring to accept money from a broker
to make false entries in the bank's books. Yonnone, who was
senior vice president of the bank, faces five years in jail and
a 250,000 dlr fine.

A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action.
    A Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> spokesman said the company
had no comment on TWA's offer for USAir or on its proposal to
negotiate a three-way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont.
    "We don't have all the details," a Norfolk Southern
spokesman said. The company's 65 dlr-a-share cash offer for
Piedmont stands, he said.
    In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with
USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three-way
combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the
three-way merger would serve the best interests of the
shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers.

<TITLE>MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressmen from beef producing
states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry 
urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea
to open up their markets to imports of beef.
    Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock
issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should
push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea.
Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.
    U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied
"we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She
noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior
Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter
and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in
April for discussions on farm trade issues.
    Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400
tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned
beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S.
pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.
    In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs
for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress,
administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and
united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and
that we expect them to open their markets."

<DATELINE>   WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan formally accepted the
resignation of White House counsel Peter Wallison and named
Arthur Culvahouse, an associate of new White House chief Howard
Baker, to replace him.
    Wallison, who has handled White House legal affairs for the

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the U.S. House
subcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, Rep.
Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), said it is likely the U.S. dairy
support price will be cut next year.
    "It looks like the price cut may take place," Stenholm said
at a hearing today on dairy issues.
    Under the 1985 farm bill, the Agriculture Secretary can
lower the U.S. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt from
the current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairy
products are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department forecasts government
purchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbs
in fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987
will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.

<TITLE>MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
told Reuters.
    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
prices," he said in an interview.
    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
prevailing market prices.
    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.
    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of
commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
price prevailing for these products at the time of
purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."
    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
United States ready to supply this?" he said.
    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
offered," he said.
    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

<TITLE>LEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Key tax and budget lawmakers
Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new
securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street
and put pressure on brokerage stocks.
    Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut
federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target
of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax
be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.
    The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways
and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would
tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5
percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.
    Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early
to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities
transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by
congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.
    The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he
is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan
maintains his staunch opposition.
    "First we've got to decide whether to raise additional
revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At
this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,"
Rostenkowski said in a statement.
    He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting
Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source
said. The idea was presented only as something that might or
might not be valuable, he said.
    House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was
another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed
to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.
   The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend
specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee
will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in
1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision
on how the taxes will be raised.
    The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of
revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the
deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.
    But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive
securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and
there were uncertainties about the details of the tax.
    Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so
far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the
budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no
decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.
    At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a
general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that
are guaranteed to anger those who must pay.
    "We could just do all of them," one congressional source said
of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil
import fee and others.

<TITLE>AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of the American Farm
Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday
to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without
alterations.
    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"
said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been
in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
the legislation.
    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
advanced," Kleckner said.
    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
competitive in the world market.
    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
the new loan rate.
    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat
because of adverse weather.

<TITLE>U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR PLAN RAISES ANTITRUST ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A plan by U.S. semiconductor firms to
cooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms in
Japan could conflict with anti-monopoly law, the plan's backers
said.
    The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news
conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to
build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant.
    Asked whether U.S. antitrust regulators might object,
Charles Sporck, president of National Semiconductor Corp, said,
"That is a possibility."
    Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in
the project but he declined to estimate how much would be
sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would
require.
    Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan
ready by June 1.
    Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing
facility and an executive to head up the consortium.
    The consortium could be operating by the end of the year,
and the facility working in 18 months, he said.
    International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate
in the effort, Paul Low, an IBM executive, said.
    He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others
vital to the semiconductor industry, such as toolmakers, would
be invited to participate.
    Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be
produced, stressing that the emphasis was on developing
technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to
SEMATECH. Other aspects were still undecided, such as whether a
Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be
allowed to participate, he said.

<TITLE>VIACOM &lt;VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sumner Redstone, president of National
Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to
wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
Inc in 60 to 90 days.
    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
    "We've had counsel working for some time in every region
where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters
in a telephone interview.
    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very
closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking
approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
systems since September when its management group first
advanced a buyout plan.
    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
a defintive merger agreement with National.
    National is a family business which operates a chain of
movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion
picture on any pay channel," Redstone said.
    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will
be a company expense," Redstone said.
    He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National
but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

<TITLE>BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior British official said that
protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
global trading system.
    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
of Congress.
    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
said.
    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
avoid trade disputes.
    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
occasion."
    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
to happen to the rest of us?"

    Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee

    Asked by a committee member if he expected a further

revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the
previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of
sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline
seven pct from 1985/86.
    Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at
837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down
five pct from the previous season, while cane output is
projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously
forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

<TITLE>UAW, AMC &lt;AMO> SET NEW LABOR TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers and American
Motors Corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract for
the company's threatened Kenosha, Wisc. assembly plant despite
a breakdown in talks last weekend, UAW vice-president Marc
Stepp said.
    Stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks to
break off are being discussed between the two sides and that a
main table bargaining session has been scheduled Friday in
Milwaukee.
    France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault has a
controlling stake in American Motors.
    Stepp said the union intends "to exert full efforts" to
reach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past
1989, when AMC has said production will end unless the UAW
grants concessions on labor costs.
    The UAW leader said the company and the union agreed in
principle in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some
6,000 Kenosha workers after lower-cost UAW contracts covering
Mazda Motor Corp's new U.S. plant in Michigan and the New
United Motor plant in California operated by Toyota.
    Stepp said there is such deep hostility between the company
and union locals in Milwaukee and Kenosha that communication
between them is very difficult.
    But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new
contract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsin
operations despite the impasse.
    AMC has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours to
ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the
concessions it wants.
    The Kenosha plant builds AMC's Renault cars and a line of
Chrysler Corp &lt;C> vehicles under a contract assembly deal.

<TITLE>DOME&lt;DMP> DEBT PLAN LIKELY CIRCULATED NEXT WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to reschedule
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely be
detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesday
next week, a company spokesman said.
    Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's
debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from
discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told
Reuters in response to an inquiry.
    Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3
billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to
implement the debt plan now under negotiation.
    Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement
outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following
release of the plan to lenders.
    Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt
plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle
from creditors prior to June 30.
    The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a
substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an
interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with
cash flow generated by assets backing the loans.
    Annesley also said there was no change in the status of
legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are
seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.
    Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss
francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss
franc denominated debt in default.
    Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a
Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.
    Dome Petroleum's 1986 fourth quarter and year earnings will
likely be reported at the end of March, he also said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Confessed spy Jonathan Pollard was
sentenced today to life in prison for passing thousands of
pages of top-secret U.S. military documents to Israel.
    Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was sentenced
for his role in what prosecutors described as one of the most
serious breaches of security in U.S. history.
    Pollard, a 32-year-old American Jew, claimed he was acting
out of concern for Israel's safety and the belief that U.S.
officials were withholding intelligence from Israel.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Energy and Commerce committee
chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said the Securities and Exchange
Commission should step up its enforcement of regulations which
require companies to disclose corporate fraud and waste.
    Dingell made the comment at the start of a hearing on
alleged overcharges by TRW Inc on its defense contracts.
    He said the SEC seemed to have stopped demanding such
disclosures, which are required by securities laws.
    "In the wake of the foreign bribery cases in the 1970s, the
SEC instituted a vigorous program of self-policing, using
external auditors, investigators, and counsel. It should do so
again," Dingell said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon."
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

<TITLE>USDA TRANSMITS FARM PROPOSALS TO CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration officially
submitted to Congress its proposals to cut back U.S. farmers'
income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions from
income support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates,
Senate staff said.
    The recommendations, first outlined last January in
President Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, were
transmitted to both houses of Congress as legislative
proposals.
    It was not clear which lawmakers might introduce the
measures.
    The most controversial proposal in the package would make
10 pct annual reductions in target prices for major
commodities. A number of legislators have predicted the target
price proposal will not move in Congress.
    The package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option to
producers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissible
reduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct.
    Under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of his
deficiency payment regardless of how much he plants.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade
issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China
could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.
    "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member
of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations
subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.
    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of
China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final
touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    
The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational
group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,
would offer both potential export markets and potential
competition for U.S. industries, he said.
    "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.
business," Yeutter said.
    "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he
added.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pan Am Corp said its Pan American World
Airways unit will reduce management costs by 20 pct, or about
80 mln dlrs, through job cuts, salary freezes and other
measures.
    Pan Am also said it has asked its labor unions to help
lower costs by an additional 180 mln dlrs.
    The airline said it will eliminate 464 managment positions
and freeze all management salaries, a move that will save 30
mln dlrs a year.
    An additional 50 mln dlrs of expenses under management's
control will also be cut, it said without offering details.
    Pan Am said it is seeking a 20 pct pay cut from its unions.
    Pan Am vice chairman Martin R. Shugrue said in a statement,
"Management is leading the way, but with 40 pct of our
operating expenses represented by labor costs, we must have the
cooperation of our labor unions if we are to make additional
improvements to our 1987 operating plan."
    Shugrue asked Pan Am's unions to begin negotiations on the
pay cuts immediately.

<TITLE>RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of talks to introduce
new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee
Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil
having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President
of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon
said.
    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25
pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable
as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.
    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"
Calmon added.
    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,
Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln
bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,
leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.
    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was
better than such a quota reduction," he added.
    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green
coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe
drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under
10 mln bags.
    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of
which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest
this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.
    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last
year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe
it was higher than this.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration's
cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet
Friday to discuss, among other issues, the status of
agricultural legislation, administration officials said.
    The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture
Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on
the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought
before the council, the officials said.
    Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make
a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials
have said the matter is not under active consideration.
    USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative
proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and
speed up loan rate reductions.

<TITLE>U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A meeting among government agencies
today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to
a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European
Community, U.S. trade officials said.
    Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at
a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials
of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure
on EC member states.
    "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.
trade official.
    One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to
member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great
cost."
    U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on
which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.
    "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade
official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on
its farm price package.
    Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters
the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the
vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said
"sometimes its better not to be specific."
    U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned
another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR SALES UP 6.7 PCT IN LATE FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of new cars by the U.S. auto
industry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of
a year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> was an
exception with an eight pct drop.
    The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry
from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car
manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month
from last year.
    GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months,
took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28
period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the
entire industry were depressed from the ending of major
marketing incentive campaigns.
    At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co &lt;F> said its car
sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> was up
11.3 pct.
    The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the
full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February,
including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.
    Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold
in the seven selling days of late February represented a
seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the
556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.
    Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,
including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a
breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in
1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of
widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,
analysts said.
    GM sales vice-president C.N. "Bud" Moore said in a
statement that his company's sales "began their recovery from
the low point reached in January, and we expect the improvement
to continue in coming months."
    Anne Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber and Co,
told Reuters that GM's sales were weak, but added: "I think
sales will get better in the spring."
    "GM may make more production cuts in view of the weak
sales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build
inventories," she said.
    In a further effort to revive sales, GM said its
Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Buick divisions would offer many of
their new car lines through April 30 with discount loan
packages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts
to 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash
rebates.
    Among the smaller U.S.-based manufacturers, Japanese-owned
American Honda &lt;HMC> said its late February car sales rose 96.2
pct from last year while Japanese-owned Nissan &lt;NSANY> was up
35.9 pct.
    German-owned Volkswagen of America fell 42.5 pct, American
Motors Corp &lt;AMO> plunged 62.5 pct and Japan's Toyota &lt;TOYOY>
sold 1,082 domestic makes compared with none a year ago before
it started domestic production.
    Detroit's late February truck sales were generally positive
with GM up 10.9 pct, Ford up 48 pct, Chrysler gaining 46 pct
and AMC's jeep sales off 4.0 pct.
    Imported cars sales, released monthly, were estimated at
219,300 in February, a 0.4 pct rise from last year and 28.3 pct
of the overall car market. That was lower than January's 31.4
pct share but above the 26.3 pct share a year ago.

<TITLE>CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he
expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference
following presentation of the central bank's annual report in
the House of Commons today.
    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.
    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound
despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in
debt plagued countries such as Brazil.
    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I
think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told
reporters.

<TITLE>ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked
lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing
of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
outstanding debt with the proceeds.
    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting
dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in
a statement.
    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached."
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made "at substantially reduced levels."
    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,
or 12.27 dlrs a share.
    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4
mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was
concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given
the dollar's decline in the last 18 months.
    "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the
import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told
a House Appropriations subcommittee.
    Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not
generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods
and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating
competitive exports, he said.

<TITLE>FORMER TRW&lt;TRW> EMPLOYEE SAYS FIRM WAS UNETHICAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former TRW Inc controller told a
Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in
its defense contracts with the government.
    "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever
vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only
pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits
their financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a
House Oversight subcommittee hearing.
    Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components
division in Cleveland.
    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not
understand why the Defense Department had taken no action
against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it
had substantially overcharged the government for military
aircraft parts.
    "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department
Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books
and other problems in one of the company's divisions in
Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of
the federal government on various military aircraft parts,"
Dingell said.
    "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRW
inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three
times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial
engine blade," Dingell said in a statement.
    Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against
TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the
government. The Justice Department later joined the suit.
    "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW,
I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management,
many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and
ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's
(1984) report to the government," he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PENTAGON DELAYS PLAN TO BUY EUROPEAN MISSILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Army has delayed plans to
buy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S.
ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, Defense
Department officials said.
    The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier
missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap
partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York
Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985.
    Despite recent indications by the service that it intended
to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters a
final decision had been suspended because some Army officials
favored a more versatile gun-missile combination.
    The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide
to U.S. firms.
    "The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been
made," said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified.
    "There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see
if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an
integrated system of our own," said another official.
    Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said, however, that Ronald and
Rapier "are not out of the picture by a long shot."
    There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject a
missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun
and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle.
    Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S.
firms, including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Boeing Co &lt;BA>, FMC
Corp &lt;FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML>.
    But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an
"off-the-shelf" gun-missile combination could not be fielded
quickly enough.
     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. York
gun, made by Ford Motor Co &lt;F> Aerospace and Communications
Corp, after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on
the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack
helicopters at the proper range.
    The Army later expanded the division air defense concept,
announcing it would divide the system into five different
components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion
dlrs, including a missile and gun-system combination on a
tracked vehicle.

beginning in late 1984.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs
in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a
large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration
between national and international markets, the OECD said.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34
pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in
the relative importance of the instruments used in
international financing.
    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and
euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing
rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for
floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.
    The OECD said another striking feature of international
capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of
lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,
which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.
    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a
notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing
through the flotation of fixed-interest securities.
    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new
techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.
    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of
equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a
rapidly expanding market for euro-equities.
    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers
was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing
operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger
debt management policies. Growing integration with national
markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on
international markets.
    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market
for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten
issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to
traditional forms of bank lending.
    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a
possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and
possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.
    It said many market participants saw little scope for a
further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in
the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.
    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in
demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers
would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided
by the market for euro-commercial paper.
    "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market
will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from
lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major
advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would
require a significantly broader investor base.

<TITLE>NYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Bernice Napach, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading in energy futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next
five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing
chairman Michel Marks.
    "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous
period of transition that will last five to 10 years," Marks
said, adding that volume will soar, international participation
will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil
companies, and speculators will grow.
    Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when
board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman
of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.
    "The priority of the next 10 years is operational
efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product
development," said Marks.
    Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out
of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in
order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that
are already planned.
    Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by
the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined
products volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.
    Much of the increased activity will come from the
international sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growth
area," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign
producer countries to foreign independent operators.
     He said it would be difficult to develop a futures
contract based on an internationally traded crude although he
previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.
    "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude
besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said.
     Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on
an international product rather than an international crude
will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He
said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of
developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.
    Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the
major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and
institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,
and insurance companies, Marks said.
    "The commodities markets have become financial markets and
should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,"
Marks said.
    He said speculators will increase their share of the energy
futures markets in the coming years from the current  share of
about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70
pct share.

to submit a plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court under which it will acquire Bell Petroleum Services INc's
by paying out all of its creditors and issue one share for each
shares of Bell's stock.
    This proposal has been amended from a previously rejected
offer of .50 Regal share for each Bell share.
    Regal said its will pursue the acquisition without the
support of Bell's management.
    Bell Petroleum filed its Chapter 11 petition in November
1986 and has not, as yet, filed a plan of reorganization but
has only sought an order extending the exclusive order,
according to Regal.
    Bell Petroleum President Ed Runyan said the company is
evaluating Regal's latest offer and evaluating other
alternatives.
    Runyan said Bell is meeting tomorrow with another potential
suitor.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. oil demand as measured by
products supplied rose 2.1 pct in the four weeks ended February
27 to 16.39 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.05 mln in the
same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) said.
    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in
the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier.
    Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44
mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up
1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln
bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily
crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln
bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said.
    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd,
up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said.
    Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987

<TITLE>SECURITIES GROUP FAVORS NEW BANK POWER FREEZE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities Industry Association
endorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking
Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for
commercial banks.
    Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co,
told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment
banking firms, supported committee members who want the Federal
Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank
holding companies seeking new powers.
    "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance
pending congressional review," Gerard said.     
    The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a
federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan
associations and prohibit new nonbank banks.
    Gerard said the securities association had no position on
nonbank banks.
    The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive
study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates
commercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said.
Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on the
applications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust
New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.   
    The study was likely to show substantial benefits from
continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking,
he said.
    Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker
Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would
hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds
that invest in securities.
    "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax
on the saver and investor," Gerard said.
    In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from the
United States to other countries, he said.

<DATELINE>    Bogota, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>the sharp fall in international coffee
prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation,
finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.
    "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope the
foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"
he said.
    He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not
totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
colombia's financial state, which he described as sound.
    Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss
of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.
    The conservative party and the country's largest trade
union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following
the price drop.
    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
of 13.6 billion dlrs.

    Robert White, Canada's deputy chief of delegation, replied
the law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservations

<TITLE>EXCHANGE BANK &lt;EXCG> SEES BANK INDUSTRY SHAKEOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opportunities for medium-sized banks to
compete in the face of the increasing centralization of the
financial services industry may be dwindling, according to John
Rau, president of the Exchange National Bank of Chicago.
    "We're going to see a continued shaking-out of the banking
industry," Rau told Reuters after a speech to securities
analysts and investment advisors.
    Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated its
resources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago and
Midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market
companies, and sales and trading of financial services.    
    "Most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost
consumer deposits for their income. We decided to move our
franchise into a less susceptible niche," Rau said.
    "Nichemanship is a very difficult thing, especially in
urban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-market
oriented," Rau said. "The odds are against other banks doing
what we have done."
    Exchange National Bank is the principal subsidiary of The
Exchange International Corp. With total assets of 1.9 billion
dlrs, it is Chicago's fifth largest bank. Net income totalled
10.2 mln dlrs or 1.10 dlrs a share in 1986, up from 7.7 mln
dlrs or one dlr a share in 1985.

    The guerrillas have forced the shutdown of most of

<TITLE>IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jean-Loup Fievet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ivory Coast today predicted that the
present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the
recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in
London would not last long.
    Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer
nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an
oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis
Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be
obliged to restore their positions.
    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he
told a news conference here at his return from the failed
London talks.
    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in
London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the
lowest since 1982.
    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs
(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by
Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the
slide on the world markets continues.
    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa
producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an
African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of
next month.
    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based
Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of
the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.
    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said
without elaborating.
    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
market," he said.
    Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
    Last year, the West African nation announced that the
coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
per kilo.
    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
world market fluctuation.
    A communique read over the state-run television tonight
said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran
Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright
(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.
    The Agriculture Minister also announced the government
decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln
dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.
    Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of
Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times
following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and
coffee.
    Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to
grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,
according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.

    The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to
215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and
252 mln in January 1986.
    The smoothed deficit on invisibles fell to 226 mln from 237
mln, revised from 250 mln in December and 234 mln in the year
ago period.

<TITLE>CHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest
rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a
three month trading range which signals a bullish chart
breakout, financial analysts said.
    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign
that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may
be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts
said.
    "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state
of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.
    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory
orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth
will be slow.
    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the
Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production
figures also provided some support.
    "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of
the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be
forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative
U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First
Options of Chicago.
    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade
deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major
industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.
    "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for
bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather
than translate those into their own currencies and suffer
exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"
Michael said.
    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said
some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from
buying by Japanese interests.
    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred
after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.
    "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie
Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds
close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways
pattern we've been in for the last three months."
    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the
June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and
that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.
    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance
will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have
the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby
contract is 105-15/32.
    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June
T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106."
    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed
from other technical indicators such as relative strength
indexes and short-term momentum indicators.
    "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe
said.

Producers Board to write off 1.03 billion N.Z. Dlrs of debt
incurred on behalf of farmers under the Meat Price
Stabilisation Scheme, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.
    Douglas and Agriculture Minister Colin Moyle said in a

which removed subsidies from the farming sector.
    The write-off applies to debt occurring prior to October
1985, when stabilisation payments for sheepmeat ceased under an
industry restructuring which allowed private marketing.

<TITLE>REAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, fighting to regain
public confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal,
admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an
arms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake."
    "When it came to managing the NSC (National Security
Council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its
previous track record," Reagan said in a television address to
the American people.
    "I have already begun correcting this," he added in his
prepared remarks.
    Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes
of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to
last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret
sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed
contra rebels in Nicaragua.
    Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he
waited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid a
price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence."
    He said that a few months ago, he told the American people
he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert
operation.
    "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,
but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said.
    "There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a
mistake," he said.
    Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to
develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a
post-Khomeini government.
    "It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my
personal concern for the hostages spill over into the
geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.
    "I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that
I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,"
he said.
    The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John
Tower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans being
held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an
unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.
    It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know
or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal
activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which
hatched the operation.
    Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's
recommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact,
I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in
even better order."
    He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican
leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped
Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress,
"especially on foreign and national security policies."
    He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci,
was rebuilding the national security staff "with proper
management discipline."
    Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now
consisted of new people.
    He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee
to head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'".
    Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a
member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts
as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.
    But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC
staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs,
ands, or buts."
    Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong
defense of his Iran policy.
    In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called
charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on
terrorism "utterly false."
    As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union
speech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" but
defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.
    By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that
was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident
demeanor.
    He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "and
for those of my administration."
    "As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my
knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As
disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the
one who must answer to the American people for this behavior,"
Reagan said.
    Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had
come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies
around the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right,
even from the Soviets."
    His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet
willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS IRAN POLICY RECORDS IMPROPERLY KEPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said improper
record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms
initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved
arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact.
    In a televised address to the American people Reagan said
he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a
complaint made by the Tower commission.
    The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.
    "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when,"
Reagan said.
    Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty of
record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the
White House)."
    The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is
important because it could determine whether the sale violated
various laws, including the Arms Export Control Act.

<TITLE>REAGAN'S REMARKS HELP GOLD TO RECOVER IN HONG KONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an
ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that
the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers
said.
    Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of
408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and
New York's close of 410.00/50.
    Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some
initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet
this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,
they added.
    However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish
impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60
dlrs, dealers said.
    On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of
3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778
close.

<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian troops are fighting on two
widely separated fronts in a new offensive in the mountains of
Kurdistan in northern Iraq, Tehran's IRNA news agency said.
    Baghdad war communiques made no mention of fresh fighting
on northern or southern sectors, but a military spokesman
threatened a resumption of air raids on Iranian towns.
    IRNA, monitored by the BBC in London, said Iran had seized
several strategic heights in the northern assault, which
started on Tuesday. It said at least 2,000 Iraqi troops had
been killed, wounded or captured. The offensive is in the Haj
Omran area of Kurdistan, scene of fierce fighting in 1983.
    Tehran radio reported last night that Iranian forces were
in control of four mountain areas, bringing several Iraqi towns
with troop concentrations within artillery range.
    In the south, IRNA said, Iranian forces captured several
Iraqi defence posts east of Iraq's second city, Basra, in a
drive north along the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
    Today is the end of a two-week-long Iraqi moratorium on air
raids declared on condition that Iran stop attacking Iraqi
territory and shelling its towns.
    Iraq's war spokesman said Iran had kept up its attacks and
had made "boasts of illusory victories."

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Francesco Cossiga meets political
leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the
resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
    Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister
five times previously and whom the majority Christian
Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again.
    The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing
five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De
Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's
president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister.
    Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and
could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading
parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the
Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being
denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general
elections are likely unless agreement can be reached.
    Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding
talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists
and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and
Social Democrats.  After the consultations, Cossiga will name a
prime minister-designate who will try to form a government.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abnormally warm and dry weather over most
parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News
Agency said.
    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in
eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant
diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing
areas, it said.
    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and
other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than
seven months.
    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of
water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,
lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric
power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and
consumers.
    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels
in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making
harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.
    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.
More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340
hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with
Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim
its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.
    He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint
production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard
Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been
held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.
    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty
foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,
which would complete production.
    "We expect the successful cooperation between us and
Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other
Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.
    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of
shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese
technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to
competitors in Europe and South Korea.
    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs
since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands
at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly
three mln dlrs.
    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest
shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun
diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and
other machinery.
    "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"
he said.
    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln
U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the
previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more
than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.
    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead
weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships
of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.
    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least
until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship
repairing was bright.

<TITLE>CREDITORS SEEK SWIFT RESCUE PACKAGE FOR JAPAN LINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of creditor banks hopes to work
out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>, one of the
world's largest tanker operators, by the end of Japan's
business year on March 31, a spokesman for the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said.
    Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the
end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and
reserves totalling 63.40 billion.
    In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of
about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153
billion in loans to its subsidiaries.
    Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the
world shipping recession had hit the company hard.
    The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and
three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in
loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy
seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.
    The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line's largest creditor, said
the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and
will be worked out before long.
    Commenting on the article, he said the details of the
package have not yet been settled.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia heads for general elections in
six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20
years, economists and officials said.
    The government expects no spillover of "people power" from
the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of
President Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the
coming parliamentary elections is assured.
    However, Western diplomats said it is the country's
deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its
stability.
    Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to
Indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5
billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas
account for 70 pct of export income.
    The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections,
Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay
increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending.
    The government has also recently increased transport fares
and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the
second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8
pct.
    The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in
1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio
widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986.
    Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for
almost a third of the 1987/88 budget.
    A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross
domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when
Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered
nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in
1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year.
    In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom
years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct,
the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings.
    Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its
share of new projects being built with overseas money, because
it cannot afford even to meet local costs.
    In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans
totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37
billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the
country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors.
    A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December
was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr
loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments.
    Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr
loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which
would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are
on the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a
total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation.
    U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that
economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's
fundamental stability.
    The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so
far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem
countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting
unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless
it is tackled.
    It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that
unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach
what it termed "unacceptable levels."
    Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of
last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35
pct.
    What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute
within Suharto's government, with his Western-trained
technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported
by the international financial community.
    But another group supports a protected economy, with more
import substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said.
    The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the
dollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is
currently working on a series of measures to further encourage
foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector.
    The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's
ability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say.
    So far, despite three packages of economic measures over
the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that
are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by
business associates, diplomats and bankers say.
    Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on
monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that
Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems.

<TITLE>REAGAN SPEECH WINS MIXED REACTION FROM CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Republicans in Congress hailed
President Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid
and constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, said
Reagan would now have to match his words with action.
    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West
Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that
Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech is
not enough to rebuild trust."
    "President Reagan told the American people what they needed
to hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said.
    Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission report
criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for the
first time the Iran arms policy, and not just its
implementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility for
the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
    Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the
administration would "remain under a cloud" until several key
figures in the scandal, including fired National Security
Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John
Poindexter, have told "the whole truth."
    Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday
of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace
Donald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement of
Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC.
    Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure in
admitting mistakes without apologising for them.
    Some House Democrats, including Speaker James Wright of
Texas, said earlier they would delay their reaction until
tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its
impact.

<TITLE>OPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to
official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is
likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister
of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.
    Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,
blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and
demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third
quarter will be in better balance."
    He said the market is in a period of transition while the
impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix
prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.
    Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude
oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,
Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that."
    "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think
they'll help each other," he said.
    Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price
Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had
been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.
    "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting
because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The easing of rules governing overseas use
of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but
has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,
bond managers and traders said.
    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in
the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping
the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the
Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the
freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese
accord to internationalise the yen, they said.
    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese
interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily
with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other
currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85
pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.
    "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are
only after attractive money," one bond trader said.
    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous
year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the
total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of
Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.
    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among
Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the
prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort
to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.
    But the fever continues and the number of offerings could
double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko
Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.
    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by
Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting
period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is
strong, he added.
    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more
attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency
investments, traders said.
    "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing
(in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond
department.
    While few foreigners are interested in the secondary
market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life
insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the
bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer
little currency risk, traders said.
    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting
period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from
180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that
reflow was fairly small.
    "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the
Euroyen market," he said.
    One trader said that although demand from Japanese
investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said
many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.
Interest rates decline further.
    To encourage further international use of the yen, the
ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen
commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying
demand from potential borrowers.
    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit
non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next
few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic
participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese
banks object to the short-term paper market which they see
encroaching on their business territory.
    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more
demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift
into shorter-term securities if need be.
    "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond
manager said. If more financial instruments were available,
there might be more trades in yen, he added.
    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though
some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if
they had shorter maturities, traders said.
    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond
maturities within a few months.
    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities
are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules
governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use
of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the
Japanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raise
funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the
Japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.
    The Finance Ministry official said the government must
constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of
borrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its status
without change," he said.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's main paddy crop is expected
to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from
a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35
mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.
    It said a joint field survey late last month by the
association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is
lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.
    The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon
Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were
especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of
1986.
    It said last November that the drought reduced total
national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this
year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.
    The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy
output.

    Trading banks polled by Reuters said their ability to offer
money market services during the strike depends on whether
Databank remains open, and whether the banks have enough staff
to process transactions.
    A spokesman for the New Zealand Foreign Exchange
Association said dealers would be able to trade during the
strike.
    But the spokesman added that from March 6 to 10 the value
date of currency transactions will be March 16.
    Trading bank spokesmen told Reuters they will try to honour
transactions in which an offshore party sought payment on March
9 or 10, but they could not guarantee settlement.
    The Futures Exchange said trading members and their clients
will be able to continue trading provided they have made
suitable financial arrangements.
    The trading banks affected are the &lt;Bank of New Zealand>,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S>, Westpac
Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> and &lt;National Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.

<TITLE>BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>
(BHP) said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of
rights to float a new company, &lt;BHP Gold Mines Ltd> (BHPGM),
which will hold most of BHP's gold interests.
    In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be
priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer.
BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares, or 56 pct
of issued capital, on the same terms.
    BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP's gold interests,
excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea's &lt;Ok Tedi Mining Ltd>
and those interests held by BHP's &lt;Utah International Inc>.
    The BHP statement said the issue will be made to
shareholders registered on March 27. It opens April 4 and
closes April 29, and is underwritten by &lt;J.B. Were and Son>.
Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March
23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.
    BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger
gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It
said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by
the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several
Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and
Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development.
    The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP's 45 pct stake
in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and
its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland.
    BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality
gold stock.
    "The diversity and depth of BHP Gold's portfolio ... Give
the company a sound foundation in current gold production and
an exciting potential for growth," he said.

<TITLE>HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
&lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
share analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
one-for-five bonus issue.
    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
12 pct.
    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion
House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
pct in 1985.
    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
    The strength of the real-estate market was another major
income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
and other foreign banks," one analyst said.
    The high level of activity on the capital and equities
markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.
    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much
lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."
    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Texas, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of Hughes Tool Co
&lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500
billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a
projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a
39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420
billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money
traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill
supply at about 1,300 yen.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<TITLE>HAWKE SEES FOUR BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Treasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget
deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official
forecast of 3.5 billion.
    Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit "may turn out
at four billion." He and Keating last week warned that the
budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp
decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement.
    A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with
private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86
shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs.
    Hawke said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of
forecast Gross Domestic Product against five pct when he took
office during the 1982/83 year.
    "In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6
billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion,
it may turn out at four billion dlrs," Hawke said.
    In a separate interview Keating said: "The deficit for this
year, projected, was 3.5 billion .... It is in fact running ...
Over four billion and we will be trying to bring that in close
to target."

an early round of bill offers from the discount houses. The
Bank forecast the shortage in the system today at around 1.15
billion stg.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 732 mln stg and exchequer transactions some 245 mln. In
addition, bankers' balances below target and a rise in note

<TITLE>SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said it raised the
reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
money supply and inflation targets.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said the measure would take effect from March 13.
    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the
statement said.
    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
rate unchanged.
    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
prices were under control.
    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

    Japan, the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of

from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne, the sources said.
    "Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese creditor banks are close to a
decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they
will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable
debts owed by developing nations, international financial
sources told Reuters.
    Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the
firm set up before the end of the month, they said.
    The scheme is intended to improve financial management at
the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts
turning bad, the sources said.
    Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would
indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68
billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese
creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.
    Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid
a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.
    There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and
perhaps as many as 28, they said.
    About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans
totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about
15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.
    The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the
Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.
    The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with
participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.
    The firm will then use the funds to buy from its
stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign
loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.
    The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.
    Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to
debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.
    The financial sources said interest payments to the firm
would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have
asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss
reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.
    A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it
may encourage new lending to developing countries.
    The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up
to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled
countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting
for one pct of the loans.

<TITLE>IRAN REPORTS HEAVY FIGHTING IN IRAQI KURDISTAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqi
counter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged
mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the
northern war front.
    Iran launched the new offensive, codenamed Karbala-7, on
Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran
border area of northeast Iraq.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the
troops "continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts
into enemy positions."
    It said "remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200
of its personnel killed or wounded." One battalion of the 25th
Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today
suffered 70 pct losses, the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of
war had been taken from the front.
    IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire
were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given.
    The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz
some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983.
Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on
government positions and installations in northern Iraq.
    IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of
munitions in the latest fighting.
    The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan
fighting, or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the
southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra.
    IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited
newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the
battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and
burnt military equipment.
    They quoted an Iranian soldier, Hamid Dehqani, as saying
heavy rainfall during the past few days "had paralysed the Iraqi
enemy from embarking on any action" against the attacking
Iranians.
    IRNA referred to the "Fish Canal" -- the man-made Fish Lake
-- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern
side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
    The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the
Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the
canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops.

<TITLE>TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
earlier, the central bank said.
    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
March 4.
    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
billion, according to official statistics.
    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
of this year.
    The reserves could support imports of more than two years
for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the
U.S.

coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March
23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry
spokesman said.
    Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold
from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for
these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely
to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.
    At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of
thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will
be sold both in Belgium and abroad.
    The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,
the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's
currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.
    The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the
EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark
Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of
economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a
political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the
Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.
    The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand
is expected to come from coin collectors.

<TITLE>BANK OF CEYLON TO ADOPT NEW POLICIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sri Lanka's largest bank, the
government-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a more
aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess
liquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge the
country's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairman
Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview.
    The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is
holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to
be announced later, he said.
    Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of
Ceylon, the nation's central bank, until January.
    A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratne
declined to identify, has agreed in principal to guarantee
export credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further.
    The bank may also consider more actively participating in
the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial
non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees,
or about 70 pct of the total market, he said.
    Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd.
    The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating
here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in
MBSL, Sandaratne said.
    He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits
for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the
previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions
for bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln
allotted for general provisions, he added.

<DATELINE>    PORT MORESBY, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Papua New Guinea Government
will establish a public corporation to invest in resources
projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
    "We intend to provide a means through which less privileged
individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the
development of mining and petroleum projects," he told
Parliament.
    Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in
major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects
would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take
over the state's equity in current developments.
    Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with
exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on
about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
    "The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New
Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases
in an orderly way," he said.
    Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be
established or exactly what form it would take, but said the
government would study whether it should be directly involved
in exploration or development.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against
the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at
today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.
The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last
week.
    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,
with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.
    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for
transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last
week.
    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the
central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as
punishment for inadequate documentation in previous
transactions.
    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are
based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has
complained in the past that many are failing to produce the
right paperwork within the specified time.

<TITLE>U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic
Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to
reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
    "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we
have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he
told a press conference after three days of talks.
    "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need
visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more
imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."
    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,
Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce
its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.
    He named several areas of particular concern to Washington
-- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport,
agricultural products and car telephones.
    He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in
semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese
producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other
than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese
market has not increased, he said.

<TITLE>JAPANESE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SEEN SLUGGISH IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese private plant and equipment
investment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987, starting April 1,
from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing
sector spending, the Japan Development Bank said.
    Capital spending by manufacturing industries, hit hard by
the rise of the yen, will fall 5.6 pct, a survey said.
    Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow
four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have
benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust, it said.
    The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise
the bank projected for the current fiscal year.
    In the manufacturing sector, iron and steel companies are
the most pessimistic, with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut.
    Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will
decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively, the survey said.
    In the non-manufacturing sector, transport and leasing
service industries are expected to increase their spending by
15.7 pct and 10.6 pct, respectively.
    The bank's survey, conducted in early February, was based
on questionnaires from 1,738 corporations in all sectors having
a business relationship with the bank.

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY FIXES DATE OF BUDGET HEARING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for
1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the
opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.
    In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament
decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to
hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,
parliamentary officials said.
    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last
Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a
controversial government-proposed sales tax plan.
    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been
delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax
on which the budget plan is based.
    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again
boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push
through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely
negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would
like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."
    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is
planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual
income and corporate tax.
    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing
because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the
budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower
House plenary session, political analysts said.
    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an
unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the
sales tax.

<TITLE>GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KIEL, West Germany, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

<TITLE>CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The nine creditor banks of the
Singapore coffee trader &lt;Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd> are
thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company
themselves, a creditor bank official said.
    Since last December the banks have been allowing the
company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an
overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.
    At least one company has expressed interest and
negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.
    However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the
stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven
mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking
sources said.
    Teck Hock's financial adviser, Singapore International

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms," one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation."
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy."
    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now," said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity."
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners."
    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt."
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    "As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

<TITLE>U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain had a visible trade deficit of
2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
statistics show.
    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
said.
    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
increased by 2.1 billion.
    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

<TITLE>HONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market
was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr
certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank
of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced,
bankers said.
    Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road
to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early
February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.
    Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all
major players stopped making markets in existing issues.
    The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to
swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due
to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs
flooded the market in January.
    Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants
pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense
speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against
the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed.
    The speculation depressed local interest rates and
unleashed a flood of new issues.
    But the speculation faded in early February and interest
rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining
the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate
capital market.
    By late February the market had recovered considerably but
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since
then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until
China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the
Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with
quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.
    Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but
began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new
issue circulated.
    When the deal was launched the major players quickly
suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own
issues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market is
going," said a European banker.
    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low
of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10
basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister
banks in the Bank of China group.
    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was
launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the
market at that time.
    But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the
present market conditionS, "the timing was just not right."
    "If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues
now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer
said.
    "But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said.
"The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as
what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals."
    Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to
recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the
group has not yet been finalised.
    "Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the
deal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such as
relationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.
    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers
decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new
issue.
    "Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese
entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue," he
said.
    Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead
managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues.

billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a
projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a

    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420

<TITLE>ARGENTINA SEEKS NEW DEBT DEADLINES, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina will tell its creditors
it needs an extension of deadlines for payment of capital and
interest on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt, Industry and
Foreign Trade Secretary Roberto Lavagna told reporters.
    "We, the developing countries, are going to insist on the
application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the
payment of capital as well as interest," he said.
    He said this could bring about what he called a possible
automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that
could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the
debt.

bought 17 mln stg of bills at the same rate and for resale on

    The Bank has thus given a total of 37 mln stg so far today,
which leaves the bulk of a 1.15 billion stg shortage still in
the system. Dealers noted that money market rates again eased
this morning and the Bank may have refused bill offers from the

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> SEEKS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hughes Tool Co said its board has
appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer
in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker
International Corp &lt;BKO>.
    Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its
agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed
if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice
Department that the Hughes board had determined to be
unreasonable.
    The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at
Hughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer.
    Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the
Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on
condition that they find a buyer approved by the  Department
for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's
Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic
electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date
the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their
agreement.
    Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it
not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes
technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions.
    Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand,
Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it
would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree."
    The company said its board found the consent decree to be
unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a
substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would
be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of
the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes
Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and
its coring and diamond bit assets.
    Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent
decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of
Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to
sell Reed.
    The company said the board decision to adopt its own
divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker
did not accept was unanimous.

<TITLE>NO MINES DAMAGE REPORTED AFTER CHILE TREMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SANTIAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A tremor hit northern Chile early today
but there were no immediate reports of victims or of damage to
the country's vital mining industry, the National Bureau for
Emergencies, ONEMI, said.
    The effects of the tremor at 0620 hrs (0920 GMT) registered
four to six degrees on the 12-degree Mercalli scale in
Antofagasta, 1,000 km north of Santiago, and five to six
degrees in Chuquicamata and Calama, at the centre of Chile's
mining region.
    The tremor was followed by a milder aftershock at 0758 hrs.
    An ONEMI spokesman said windows had been broken and a
number of cornices had fallen off buildings in the worst-hit
areas. These effects are described as up to seven degrees on
the Mercalli scale. The tremor caused a partial power cut in
northern Chile, the spokesman added.
    Quoting from the latest report from the area, received at
8.37 A.M., He said the effects of the tremor registered two to
three degrees on the Mercalli scale in Arica, on the northern
border with Peru, and three to four in Copiapo, 700 km north of
Santiago.
    ONEMI could not provide a reading on the Richter scale.

<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Hill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.
    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in
mln bpd -

<TITLE>BETHLEHEM &lt;BS> HAS INVESTIGATED CHAPTER 11</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BETHLEHEM, Pa., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bethlehem Steel Corp has
investigated the ramifications of a filing for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws but has no
present plans to file, a company spokesman told Reuters.
    The spokesman said the investigation was made some time ago
and was undertaken as a precaution in the interest of prudent
management.
    He said while Bethlehem, which has been losing money for
several years, does not intend to seek protection from
creditors now, it could do so if conditions worsened,
particularly if it ran out of cash.
    But the spokesman said Bethlehem ended 1986 with over 460
mln dlrs in cash on hand, partly due to the sale of assets over
the year, and expects to maintain its cash position at around
that level through 1987.
    At the end of 1985, Bethlehem had less than 100 mln dlrs in
cash.

<TITLE>BAKER &lt;BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT> MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baker International corp said it has
filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more
burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary
damages it did not name.
    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank
deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and
bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a
ministry spokesman said.
    The measure was published today in the Official State
Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on
rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct
from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must
lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public
interest."
    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in
a 20 pct drop in profits this year.
    Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa
told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset
investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.

<TITLE>USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said its board has
rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests."
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair
price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

<TITLE>U.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy is facing several
serious problems which threaten its continued expansion,
according to a Congressional report released today.
    The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional
Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish
growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near
future.
    Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic
report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.
    Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,
which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.
    "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion
dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger
signals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairman
Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.
    "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current
recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin
ice," the Maryland Democrat said.
    He said the danger signals included a decline in
investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining
the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled
by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the
nation's farmers.
    Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood
of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around
three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration
forecasts.
    "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're
comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful
that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that
employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident
in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,"
the Republican report said.
    "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress
is reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added.
    Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but
also wanted the government to spend more on education, job
training, research and development and health care.
    They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult
for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the
economy if this becomes necessary.
    "There is now substantial concern about the inflationary
effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary
pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money
supply," the Democrat report said.
    "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources
of capital in American investment markets means that the
Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past
in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down."
    "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy
is thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said.
    The Democrats called on the Administration to be more
aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking
new initiatives to solve the international debt problem.
    The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been
caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially
the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.
    Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to
increase American productivity including incentives for saving
and investment in plant and equipment and development of a
better educated work force.
