<TITLE>JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its
new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
John Egan told a news conference.
    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director John Edwards said.
    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
but Egan said this would take at least another three years
    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
expectations, dealers said.

<TITLE>FRENCH CGE GROUP LIKELY TO BE PRIVATISED IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-owned Cie Generale
d'Electricite (CGE) is likely to be privatised during May this
year, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the group
would be privatised during the course of this year, when it
first announced the operation in early January, the May date is
earlier than the market had expected.
    As a result it will follow close on the heels of the
privatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertising
group &lt;Agence Havas>.
    Last month the government privatised the first of the state
financial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.P>, in a
floatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.
    And in December the first of the industrial groups, glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.P>, returned to the private
sector.
    CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications to
shipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck a
deal with ITT Corp &lt;ITT.N> to create the world's second largest
telecommunications group under the Alcatel name.

<TITLE>FIVE GROUPS APPLY TO BUY FRENCH TELEPHONE GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Five consortia have applied to buy the
French state-owned telephone equipment manufacturer &lt;Cie
Generale de Constructions Telephoniques (CGCT)>, which will
give the owners control of 16 pct of the French telephone
switching market, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur said.
    The French government has given itself until the end of
April to decide which applicant will be accepted, they added.
    While several foreign groups have said they want to gain a
foothold in the French market, their potential stake in CGCT is
limited to 20 pct under privatisation laws passed last year,
with 80 pct to be left in French hands.
    The Finance Ministry sources gave no details of the groups
interested in CGCT, but several have publicly announced their
candidacies.
    U.S. Telecommunications giant American Telephone and
Telegraph Co &lt;T.N> which has been at the centre of the two-year
battle for CGCT, has teamed up with the Dutch-based &lt;Philips
Telecommunications Industrie B.V.>, a subsidiary of NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabriek &lt;PGLO.AS> and &lt;Societe Anonyme de
Telecommunications> (SAT) to present a joint bid, in
association with holding company Cie du Midi SA &lt;MCDP.P> and
five French investment funds.
    A second bid has come from the West German electronics
group Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F>, which hopes to take a 20 pct stake
in CGCT, with the French telecommunications &lt;Jeumont-Schneider>
taking the remaining 80 pct.
    Sweden's &lt;AB LM Ericsson> has also submitted a bid for the
maximum 20 pct permitted, in association with French defence
electronics group &lt;Matra>, which would hold between 40 and 49
pct, and construction group &lt;Bouygues>.
    Matra has already acquired CGCT's private telephone
business.

<TITLE>SPEAKER SEEKING SUPPORT FOR U.S. TAX INCREASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbying
congressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and the
remainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said.
    He is backing a half and half plan and has made the
suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee
privately, committee sources said.
    However, a committee source told Reuters that committee
Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker's
move was seen as building support outside the committee.
    Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no
specifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax and
also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy.
    Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, and
some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax.
    The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at
reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated
by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
    Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a
budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not
reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion
dlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.

<TITLE>TANZANIAN RAILWAYS SECURE 25.6 MLN DLRS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK , March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Responsibility for the appreciation of
the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with
those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter
    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
their currencies against the dollar.
    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
with Taiwain and Korea.
    "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
concerned about how they are perceived in the international
business community," Yeutter said.
    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
country.
    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two
or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
prevails in Taiwan."
    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50
billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not
sustainable.
    "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat
of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter
said.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS STRONGLY CRITICISE EC MILK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on
reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible
situation, French farm unions said.
    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of
planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut
milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm
union, the FNSEA, said.
    The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural
Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.
    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said
repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.
    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the
level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets
for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to
Rouen.
    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the
milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement
and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,
rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.
    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission
proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.
Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork
prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in
milk output.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its forces killed or wounded
15,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards as they crushed a new
Iranian offensive near the strategic port city of Basra.
    A high command war communique said four Revolutionary
Guards divisions attacked Iraqi positions east of Basra on the
Gulf War southern front, but they were fully crushed by noon
(0900 GMT).
    Adbul-Jabbar Mohsen, chief of the defence ministry
political department, said the Iranians had 15,000 casualties.
    Iran earlier today said its forces launched fresh attacks
near Basra last night, adding that 1,200 Iraqis were killed or
wounded in fighting near Fish Lake, 10 km east of Basra.
    In its first reaction to Tehran reports of a new Iranian
offensive on the northern front, Iraq said fighting continues
around the strategic mountain peak of Kardamanend, overlooking
the Haj Omran-Rawandiz axis close to the Iranian border.
    A military spokesman said Iran launched its attack in the
north "to (turn) Iraqi attention towards that area and relax
pressure in the south."
    He added, "Iraq knows well that Iran's main goal is to
occupy Basra in the south and that was the reason why Iraq has
repelled their new offensive so decisively and firmly."
    Iran reported heavy fighting on both fronts today.

sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid
infection, the company said.
    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,
showed that two children suffering from the disease were
treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of
serious infection during that time, the company said. The
results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine
Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the
immune system.
    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme
with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to
disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,
preventing rejection.
    "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function
occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of
T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before
treatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.
    "The children are now more active and have begun to gain
weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very
poor in comparison to normal children of the same age," the
study, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca
Buckley, said.
    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of
the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow
transplants, but for most, donors are not available or
transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other
diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by
introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.

<TITLE>OCCIDENTAL &lt;OXY> OFFERS OVER 37 MLN SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Occidental Petroleum Corp said its
common stock offering has been further increased to a total of
37,950,000 shares.
    The company explained that underwriters exercised in full
their option to increase tohe offering by buying an additional
4,950,000 shares over and above the 33 mln brought to market
yesterday. Originally, Occidental had planned to offer 30 mln
shares. It had 165 mln outstanding prior to the offering.
    The underwriters are Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Kidder
Peabody and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc.
    At the public offering price of 30.50 dlrs a share,
Occidental said, the total value of the offering was nearly
1.16 billion dlrs, making it the largest underwritten common
equity offering by a U.S. natural resource company.
    The company said the significant financial improvements
from applying the net proceeds of the offering, principally to
the reduction of debt, along with its 1986 restructuring of oil
and gas operations and the acquisition of Midcon Corp have
positioned Occidental to benefit from an improving oil and gas
industry environment.

<TITLE>CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured U.S. farmers and miners.
    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing
to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, an
Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires that the United States vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a
provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared
Congress.
    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho
and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it
faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has
blocked its consideration by the House in the past.
    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

found a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.
    Mannesmann managing board chairman Werner Dieter told the
business weekly Wirtschaftswoche in an interview that
Mannesmann wanted to invest in a U.S. Company in order to
strengthen its presence on the U.S. Market.
    Dieter said Mannesmann would act quickly when and if it
found a firm in which it wanted to take a stake.
    The Mannesmann spokesman declined to say in which
industrial sector the group may make a U.S. Acquisition or how
big the acquisition might be.
    He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a
stake in car components firm &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
    Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct
stake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the
first quarter. The spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of
intent on the takeover from the heirs of the company's late
owner but completion has been delayed by legal questions
concerning the inheritance.

<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings
for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market
conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.
    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
volume.
    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading
Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a
general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
stg from 205 mln in 1985.
    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd noted.
    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
lag, analysts said.
    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third
quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in
U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes
added.
    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty
flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
massive upturn," he said.
    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If
you are not exploring you are not going to find anything," he
noted.
    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
below 20 dlrs a barrel.
    This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC
marginal production shutting down. "OPEC has done pretty
extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,"
he added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
choke off money supply growth.
    "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said.
"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."
    "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.
    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
raising interest rates.
    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
exports less competitive.
    The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
European Community, which it joined a year ago.
    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices.
    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have
become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
money market too hard.
    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
inevitably, push lending rates higher.
    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
interest rates.

<TITLE>EC DAIRY OUTPUT ACCORD PAVES WAY FOR MORE REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials and diplomats said EC farm
ministers, who earlier this week ended another marathon
negotiating session, achieved more than ever before in the
fight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are now
preparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.
    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil
"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought the
Community so much unwelcome publicity.
    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hours
of negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cut
milk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,
now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.
    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits on
farmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, could
be expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle and
pave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.
    The deal was reached despite determined attempts at
backsliding by some states as the implications of the original
outline accord reached last December began to sink in.
    "Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministers
never wavered from the main features of the deal," one senior
official said, adding the result augured well for talks later
this month on other reforms.
    The Commission is leading the fight against food surpluses
and has now proposed the most severe annual price review, at
which ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.
    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standards
enforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to intervention
curtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effective
price cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.
    EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working on
proposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushion
them from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy and
encourage ministers to swallow the reform pill.

<TITLE>MCI &lt;MCIC> SEEKS IMMEDIATE ATT &lt;T> DEREGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>MCI Communications Corp. called for
immediate federal deregulation of American Telephone and
Telegraph Co., its principal competitor.
    MCI said it will ask the Federal Communications Commission
tomarrow to deregulate ATT in order to let marketplace forces
govern the long distance telephone market.
    "It's time to let the market manage ATT," MCI president Bert
Roberts told a news briefing here.
    MCI has seen its profits shaved recently by ATT long
distance rate reductions ordered by the FCC following the
breakup of the Bell System.
    The MCI move signals its belief that ATT may raise profits
rather than cut rates if deregulated.
    To allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead to
price increases, Roberts said one alternative open to the FCC
would be adoption of a transitional "price cap" concept.
    Roberts noted that such a plan is backed by FCC
commissioner Dennis Patrick, whose is widely expected to be
named FCC chairman.
    Roberts conceded that ATT's deregulation posed risks to
MCI.
    "The greater risk, however, is continuing the artificial
market environment created by piecemeal FCC deregulation of
ATT."

<TITLE>WESTERN CANADA HURT BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Western Canada's resource-based economy
is being hurt by international market forces and there is
little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson
said.
    "If you can tell me how we can get the international energy
price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we
can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilson
told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.
    Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat
farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson
said it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of market
forces outside the boundaries of this country."
    Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the
government's spending estimates released earlier this week,
said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing
more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.
    "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on
our part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson said
in response to questions about management of the economy from
opposition party members.
    He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the
country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States,
which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.

    According to the text of a speech made in the town of

benefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected the
agreement because he preferred there to be no change in the
EC's system of intervention. However, an objective analysis of
the accord showed it contained positive elements, he said.
    No formal vote was taken on the EC accord, but a spokesman
for the Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said Kiechle had made it
clear in discussions in Brussels that he did not accept it.
Ireland and Luxembourg were also opposed.

<TITLE>CONGRESS EYES LOANS THAT AID U.S. COMPETITORS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured American farmers and miners.
    With a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year
and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing to
hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other development
banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to
produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
    "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma
Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support
for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires the United States to vote against such
loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine
loan was "really the only one you can point to and criticize."
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions
were weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing
U.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.
    This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals.
    Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the
production, marketing and export of the commodities could be
handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker
at the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, "Many say the
banks are financing competition for American jobs."
    She recommended that the United States use its
participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans
as a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morton-Thiokol Corp will be included in
Standard and Poor's 500 Stock index, effective today, Standard
and Poor's Corp said.
    Trading in Morton-Thiokol stock opened up 4-1/4 at 50 on
turnover of 122,700 shares after
a delayed opening due to an imbalance of orders.
    There are certain funds which base their portfolio on the
500 stocks listed on the index, and the imbalance of orders
reflects those managers adding shares of Morton-Thiokol,
Standard and Poor's said.
    Adding Morton-Thiokol's stock to the 500 index list is a
"minor positive development," analyst Martin Ziegler said,
noting that it brings in new buyers for the shares and gives
the company a higher profile.
    James Arenson at DLJ Securities agreed that
inclusion on the index automatically creates new buyers and
noted it also allows those portfolio managers who could not buy
the stock to purchase shares.
    While Morton-Thiokol's stock opened up much higher, it gave
back some of its gains and is currently trading at 47-3/8, up
1-5/8, a pattern termed, by one analyst, as "typical" when a
company is newly added.

a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan
or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the
government and foreign soybean production will increase, the

    "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another

    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the
soybean loan, Haggard said.
    "I don't know if USDA is really very serious about
addressing the soybean loan problem," he said.
    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA
leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan
-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.
    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,
R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a
5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.
    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed
proposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to see
the farm bill be torn apart."
    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to
a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could
change the loan without new legislation.
    Making the loan partially in certificates which would not
have to be paid back would be one option, he said.

Lyng does not intend to discuss a wheat export enhancement
initiative to the Soviet Union at a cabinet-level Economic
Policy Council meeting set for tomorrow, an aide to Lyng said.
    "He (Lyng) does not intend to bring it up," the aide said,
adding that the subsidy offer remains "dormant."
    Lyng plans to spend "about five minutes" reviewing the status
of farm legislation on Capitol Hill before the Economic Policy
Council, which is responsible for guiding the administration's
economic policy, the aide said.
    The USDA secretary met this morning with members of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, but the handful of lawmakers
present did not ask whether the administration intended to
offer Moscow a wheat export bonus, the aide said.

Bohn said the agency was adopting a new policy of increased
risk coverage and as part of it will adopt a system of
risk-related fees.
    In an address before the Ex-Im's annual bankers conference
Bohn outlined a series of measures designed to bridge the gap
between reduced export lending by commercial banks and
activities by U.S. trading partners.
    Bohn said the bank will be more selective in requiring
soverign guarantees and will consider well-conceived projects
"even if they do not earn foreign exchange."
    He said the Exim will operate four broad programs after May
1. They are short-term insurance, a direct loan program that
will be available for both medium and long-term transactions, a
guarantee program and intermediary funding program.
    For medium-term guarantees, Bohn said Exim will increase
exporter coverage for commercial risks from the 85 pct
currently to 98 pct.

<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> said it had agreed with
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T> and Nippon Gakki
Co Ltd &lt;NGAK.T> of Japan to jointly produce the components of
the newly developed laser audio-video player.
    Philips last month announced it and Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> had
developed a world standard for the new combi-player.
    The player will be able to take the three sizes of new
compact disk videos (CDV), which give near perfect sound and
image production, as well as the traditional audio laser discs.
    Yamaha will develop the laser technology, Matsushita the
video specifications and Philips will work on rendering the
player compatible with existing European 50-hertz television
standards, Philips spokeswoman Marijke van Hooren said.
    Each company will assemble and market the product under its
own label, and it is hoped other hardware companies will join
in the marketing of the new product, she said.
    She said there were around 160 companies which hold
licences for the manufacture of CD players.

<TITLE>POLAROID &lt;PRD> UP ON REAFFIRMED OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Polaroid Corp rose following
a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that
focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders
said.
    "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the
50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong
earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and
anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch
analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by
another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be
bought at a relatively bargain price today.
    Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its
weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on
weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point
early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down
over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.
    "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and
film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40
pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the
first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier.
He expects the company to earn four dlrs a share in 1987 as
compared to 3.34 dlrs a share last year.

<TITLE>FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>French official reserves fell 45.06
billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
during the month, the ministry said.
    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
result of using very short-term financing instruments.
    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
franc.
    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
billion at end December.
    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion
francs from 75.27 billion at end December.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln
francs to 19.31 billion francs.

<TITLE>BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ****RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil has no set target for
its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of
International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,
President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster
said.
    He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its
export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it
had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as
the country's export target to ICO-member countries.
    The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an
agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.
    It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of
an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be
above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.
    Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and
market analysts before taking any decision on export policy,
but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market
conditions.
    "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause
markets to panic," Dauster added.
    He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee
to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.
    "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does
not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.
    Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said
consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two
mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.
    "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss
for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to
recover," he said.
    The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving
average of exportable production surpluses would lead to
overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher
quotas, he said.
    Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility
had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its
stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.
    Close links would continue with these producers,
particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African
countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was
envisaged at present.
    He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a
system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has
been abandoned."
    Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for
May shipment coffee will be opened.
    He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy
of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as
some exporters had suggested.
    He noted export registrations for the first four months of
the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9
mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between
11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.
    He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln
bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate
until late April.

<TITLE>BRITAIN SEEMS SET FOR NEW CASH ROW WITH EC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Youssef Azmeh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain appeared set for a new cash row
with its European Community partners as evidence emerged that
it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to
radically alter the way the EC is financed.
    Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released
yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full
impact, were they in force this year, would have left Britain
worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units.
    The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member
government after a debate expected to open next month.
    The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC
from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the
current financing system as unfair and unacceptable.
    British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has
long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the
proposals could well reopen the wound.
    This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget
contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of
the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small
size of its agricultural sector.
    Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in
the system which could also substantially increase their own EC
payments, the main opposition was expected from Britain.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent
statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present
system, under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net
payments to the EC, unless a fairer system is devised.
    The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the
proposed system as fair.
    The Commission's proposals would base a state's
contribution on its gross national product, which the
commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative
wealth.
    The main element of the previous system was a share of
value added tax collected in member states.
    The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to
take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to
be paid for by the other 11 states.
    The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all
states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs
duties on behalf of the EC.

<TITLE>SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
conditions on Wall Street.
    "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
start of a hearing on SEC activities.
    "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"
Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
is particularly distressing."
    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
    "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his
statement.
    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
disclosure of takeover attempts.
    N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee
Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
five member commission to study the securities industry for a
year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.
Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.
    "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of
illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy
of existing surveillance systems and government oversight
operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what
additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed
to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,"
Rinaldo said.

<TITLE>OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC output in February was "well below"
the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries
are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency
Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.
    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
result "of member countries' firm determination to defend the
organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
refrain from selling any quantity below that price."
    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session
planned to start on June 25.
    The official gave no figure for February output. The
statement said only that "the reduction in total supplies,
namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
those supplies fell very noticeably during that month."
    "No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
financial hardship this may entail," the statement said.
    "The very recent improvement in the price structure is an
indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
the official selling price," the statement said.
    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official
levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.
    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might
have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main
markets.
    The official said in the statement that no such emergency
session was scheduled "because of member countries' firm
determination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December.
    Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna
starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no
new date set, according to an official of the United Arab
Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.
    Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya,
Nigeria and Qatar.

<TITLE>HECK'S &lt;HEX> FILES FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NITRO, W.Va., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Heck's Inc said it has filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy act.
    The company said its wholly owned wholesale subsidiaries,
its Maloney's subsidiary and its discount drug store operation
are not included in the filing.
    Heck's said it made the filing because its bank lending
group failed to renew on acceptable terms a credit agreement
that expired February 28.
    It said the 12 banks provided about 50 mln dlrs in credit
lines to Heck's, representing all its short-term borrowings.
    Heck's said some of the banks have demanded repayment.
    The company said another reason for the filing was a
developing shortage in merchandise as suppliers reacted to the
breakdown in bank support.
    Heck's said two representatives of the bank group, Charles
B. Gates Jr. and Walter B. Dial Jr., have left its board.
    Heck's said it is exploring, with its investment banker,
the possibility of selling all or parts of the company.
    It said the filing will allow it to work out arrangements
with suppliers for the delivery of merchandise while permitting
it to continue its previously-announced programs of
cost-cutting and the paring of operations.

<TITLE>U.S. OKAYS USAIR &lt;U> PACIFIC SOUTHWEST PURCHASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
said it gave final approval to USAir Group's proposed 400 mln
dlr acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines.
    The department said the acquisition is not likely to
substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public
interest.
    The department had given its tentative approval of the
acquisition in January.
    The department said it decided to make final its tentative
decision after reviewing the public response to it.
    The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North
America, which currently is not operating but plans to start
service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the
acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those
markets by other carriers.
    The agency said Air North America provided no support for
its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers
monopoly power in some markets.
    The transportation agency said Air North America also
failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new
entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from
increasing their service.
    The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates
exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West
for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and
Midwest.
    The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles,
San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.
     The transportation department also rejected a request by
the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to
require protections for PSA workers.
    The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective
benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA
workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such
protections.

Bert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to
improve in the current quarter compared to the previous
quarter.
    He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance
rate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but
added: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but
we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."
    The current quarter ends March 31.
    For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,
due mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.
    Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which
had been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have
had "A significantly negative impact on our profits."
    As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCC
to immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that an
unregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of its
revenues rather than cut rates further.

<TITLE>FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Verschoor, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 5 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Personal taxation has emerged as the
major economic issue in Finnish general elections later this
month, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards
indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more
market-oriented banking practices, economists say.
    Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's
second largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to
join a coalition government which is still likely to be
dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi
Sorsa.
    But the economists point out that Conservative economic
policies differ only slightly from the governments', and that
trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected.
    Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the
Conservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about
a shift from direct to indirect taxation.
    The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has
embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation,
which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The
opposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over
how to regain lost state revenues.
    One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax
exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.
    Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
(KOP), told Reuters "We want to be more free in setting interest
rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual
investors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a
system with taxation of real interest gains."
    Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on
interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said
this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering
tougher inter-bank competition.
    A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation
was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a
Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.
    "It would probably result in new practices that have been
seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in
Finland," he said, in a reference to money market instruments.
    All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been
careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.
Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years
ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has
now moderated its stance, political analysts say.
    Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter
system, and is balanced under long-term accords.
    In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth
30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been
declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which
accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.
    The bankers said taxation had become the major economic
theme of the campaign because there were few other issues.
    Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in
1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of
the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.
    The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign
trade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to
5.04 billion markka.
    Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the
largest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of
the vote. They currently hold 57 seats.
    The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is
also expected to hold on to its 37 seats.
    But increased Conservative support and a decline for the
Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives
into government. They currently hold 44 seats.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is not expected to
intervene in the U.S. government securities market to add or
drain reserves, economists said.
    Most economists said they did not expect the Fed to add
reserves with Federal funds trading below six pct.
    They said the funds rate's softer tone may indicate that
the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve
maintenance period is smaller than previously estimated.
    Fed funds opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained at that level.
Yesterday funds averaged 6.01 pct.

<TITLE>WRIGHT SAYS TAX RISE NEEDED TO CUT U.S. DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker James Wright said
President Reagan should realize that there will be no way to
meet the deficit reduction targets in the 1988 budget without a
tax increase.
    "In my judgment there isn't any way to achieve the commanded
reductions in the deficit without some additional revenue," the
Texas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the House
session.
    Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additional
tax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs in
additional revenues in the 1988 budget.
    "It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it's
a question of who has to pay," Wright said.
    He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included in
Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients,
tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home
purchases.
    Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but
has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers
were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.
    "There has to be a recognition of reality," he said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ogden Corp said a unit won approval
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to test a bed
combuster, a device that burns some hazardous wastes under
highly controlled conditions.
    The company said the approval will allow its Ogden
Environmental Services unit to operate a pilot scale model of
the device, test the results, and fine tune the instrument to
burn a number of wastes. Testing begins at the end of March.
    The wastes include contaminated soils, chlorinated solvents
such as carbon tetrachloride, non-chlorinated solvents like
toluene, and distillation residues, it said.

<TITLE>ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study of salmonella poisoning has
uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding
antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that
can infect humans and resist medicines.
    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control
tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is
resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the
resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of
antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have
been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs
is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.
    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases
that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect
humans.
    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.
    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number
of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant
infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to
298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the
victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized
for their illness.
    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always
prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating
raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "the
majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating
hamburger that was at least partially cooked."
    The researchers said the results show that "food animals are
a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
in humans, and that these infections are associated with
(antibiotic) use on farms."

<TITLE>NATIONAL CONVENIENCE &lt;NCS> TO HAVE 3RD QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Convenience Stores Inc said it
expects to report a loss for the third quarter ending March 31
due to continued poor sales in Texas, especially in Houston.
    In last year's third quarter, National Convenience earned
1,788,000 dlrs or eight cts per share, including a gain of
2,883,000 dlrs from the sale of 186 stores to another operator.
 It said the results also included earnings from gasoline
operations of 2,500,000 dlrs or 11 cts per share caused by
unusually high gross margins on gasoline sales of 12.7 cts per
gallon that were caused by rapidly falling oil prices.
    National Convenience said its third quarter is usually weak
due to winter weather.

with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the previous year.
    The 1986 losses were after taking into account net interest

<TITLE>U.S. COMMERCE'S ORTNER SAYS YEN UNDERVALUED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Dept. undersecretary of
economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar
at  current levels was fairly priced against most European
currencies.
    In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import
Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed
that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.
    "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point
against the yen," he said.
    On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yen
is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10
or 15 pct."
    In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally,
said he thought that the dollar against most European
currencies was "fairly priced."
    Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate
values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate
differentiations.
    Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade
deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the
Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the
first 15 pct decline had little impact.
    He said there were indications now that the trade deficit
was beginning to level off.
    Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it
would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough
foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said
the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined
in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative.

<TITLE>FARMERS CONCERNED ABOUT BRITISH SUGAR OWNERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains
concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite
last week's decision by the government to block bids from
Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.
    The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider
the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger
Commission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are still
concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of
British Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford as
providing the long-term stability we want."
    The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation
last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S
and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority
of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.
    Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet
processor is now likely. "We are looking again at the
undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and
which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.
The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,
is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC
report which it says need further explanation.

<TITLE>DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Raymond Gijsen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaks of a major Dutch official
economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate
reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this
year, political and market sources say.
    Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness
this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage
increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some
calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.
    But whatever the government's response, the central bank
will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.
    The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)
publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will
also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and
the economy.
    Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate
reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch
economic growth was now seen around one pct.
    Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the
decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West
Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,
Pierson said in its February economic outlook.
    The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct
growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of
2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.
    The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the
government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of
reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.
    Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central
bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if
necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.
    Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised
the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in
last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and
expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.
    But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy
had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the
dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.
    Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not
to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead
lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.
    Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move
saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on
the money market, noting "the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the
moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already
far below the market rates."
    Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of
the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest
rate policies serve that goal.
    Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands
recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold
to take profits.
    Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would
reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more
dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch
interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued
completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.
    Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision
not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson
warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.
    Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry
and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having
said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower
Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.
    One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down
to reduce the government debt burden.
    A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were
needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between
the ministry and the central bank. "The cabinet's policy is
steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark," he said.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp said its board declared a
three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50 pct stock
dividend and raised the quarterly dividend by seven pct.
    The company said the dividend was raised to 37.5 cts a
share from 35 cts on a pre-split basis, equal to a 25 ct
dividend on a post-split basis.
    Chrysler said the stock dividend is payable April 13 to
holders of record March 23 while the cash dividend is payable
April 15 to holders of record March 23. It said cash will be
paid in lieu of fractional shares.
    With the split, Chrysler said 13.2 mln shares remain to be
purchased in its stock repurchase program that began in late
1984. That program now has a target of 56.3 mln shares with the
latest stock split.
    Chrysler said in a statement the actions "reflect not only
our outstanding performance over the past few years but also
our optimism about the company's future."

<TITLE>CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
calculating first quarter results.
    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
government's Inspector General of Banks.
    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
non-interest expenses and income taxes.
    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
fiscal 1986 year-end.
    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.
    The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World grain trade could be turning
the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a
Cargill, Inc. analyst said.
    Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David
Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a
gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow
rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.
    He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in
many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and
could lead to more activity in other grain markets.
    Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest
level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has
begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their
expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

<TITLE>NPPC DELEGATES APPROVE DISEASE AND DRUG PROGRAMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delegates from the National Pork
Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for
control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a
national safe drug use program.
    The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in
Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication
program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's
PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.
    The PRV committee received results of a three year, five
state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in
eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project
was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.
    "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to
deal with their own problems according to a timetable that
suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV
oversight committee said.
    In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan
asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug
use program.
    The program would establish better relationships between
producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality
assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.
    "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are
concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs
safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in
effect," Wehler said.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
to.
    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said
Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."
    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist
at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, Fellner said.
    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in Washington.
    The Bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
England," he added.
    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    This was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

Japan if the Japanese do not permit U.S. construction firms to
participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport.
    But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that U.S. firms would have a
chance at the work.
    "I think he will honor that commitment," Baldrige told the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs."
    He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese
firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States.

(about 295 mln barrels) of crude in 1986 against 44.3 mln

figures released today by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.

    Officials say Egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day,
but production was cut when world prices plunged last year.
    In an attempt to help OPEC stabilize the world market,
Egypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its
current output of 870,000 bpd.
    Egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells
its top Suez and Ras Bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Overseas Capital Corp said it
authorized redemption on April 17 of its 4-3/4 pct and five pct
convertible debentures due 1988.
    The Chrysler Corp unit said the move is prompted by the
parent company's three-for-two stock split, which requires a
recalculation of the debentures' conversion prices that will
adversely affect those prices by at least five pct.

<TITLE>POLISH TRADE OFFICIAL CALLS FOR FREER MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Janusz
Kaczurba told Reuters that Poland would have to diverge from
traditional Communist bloc centrally-planned economic policies
if it wanted to bring about economic renewal and compete in
world markets.
    Stressing his commitment to a series of reforms recently
introduced to streamline the economy and boost export-oriented
industry, he also called for an expansion in the role of the
private sector.
    Asked whether the policies the government was advocating
did not represent a departure from the strictly controlled
economic model within the Soviet bloc, he said in an interview
with Reuters "I don't see any alternative but to try to proceed
along the lines of economic reasoning."
    He referred specifically to bankruptcies, which he said
would be "the logical outcome of a more stringent economic
policy," once the state stopped propping up enterprises to
guarantee jobs, regardless of how inefficient they were.
    He added, "We should follow the policy of creating a system
whereby managers will be really responsible for the overall
economic effect of enterprises. This can be done in one way
only, through the reduction of subsidies."
    But he also noted the need to curtail bureaucracy of branch
ministries, allow domestic prices to reflect the world market,
make foreign exchange rates more realistic, provide incentives
to export-oriented industry and encourage private business.
    Kaczurba was talking to Reuters about the effect on the
economy of U.S. Sanctions imposed in 1982 in response to the
suppression of the Solidarity trade union under martial law.
    He acknowledged that Poland's economic decline would add to
its problems in trying to regain markets and support from
Western creditors even after Washington lifted remaining
restrictions and restored Most Favoured Nation trading status
last month.
     Western officials say Polish goods have to be more
competitive and of better quality in the face of trade wars and
protectionism amongst U.S., Japanese and European competitors.
    Reaffirming the government's view that the key to solving
some of those problems and meeting payments on a 33.5 billion
dlr foreign debt lay in increasing hard currency exports,
Kaczura said private enterprise could play a greater role.
    "I think we could have some 20,000 small private enterprises
active in export-oriented business if such operators are
successfully convinced that the policy towards the (private)
sector is stabilised," he said.
    Poland already has a more developed private sector than
most other East European countries.
    Among economic reforms already under way, Kaczurba listed
easier access to hard currency profits, tax incentives, access
to investment credits and two devaluations of the zloty to
increase competitivity of prices.
    He said such policies had been welcomed by the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, through which Poland is hoping
to gain new credits, but Poles were caught in a "vicious circle."
    Creditors wanted proof that the policies were directed
towards improving exports, but in order to fulfil their
expectations Poland first needed fresh inputs, he said.

<TITLE>TURKEY SEEKING 100,000 TONNES SUGAR - TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey is holding a buying tender for
100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.
    The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will
probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.
    Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement
from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes
of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease
the amount.
    Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported
between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and
between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.
    Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts
said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue
filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.
    Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish
1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln
in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three
seasons.
    The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish
Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey
would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the
same amount.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman John Shad said the SEC favors shortening the current
10-day period for disclosing takeover attempts but opposes
putting restrictions on the use of so-called junk bonds.
    "We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,"
Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance
subcommittee when asked for his recommendation.
    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full
disclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to
make decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some
value because of their liquidity.
    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting
takeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would
have on the communities involved.
    "We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investor
protection," Shad said.
    He said he had no comment on a proposal by House Speaker
Jim Wright, D- Texas, to tax securities transactions.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL &lt;HT> SAYS BAKER &lt;BKO> MERGER ALIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. "We're working very hard on this merger."
    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal."
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not
a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    Baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

<TITLE>FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government is to
sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe
Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale
Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
officials said.
    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, Geronimus said.
    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said.
    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its
Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.
    The government's banking adviser for the operation was
&lt;Banque Privee de Gestion Financiere>, BPGF, owned by French
financier Pierre Moussa's &lt;Pallas> group, assisted by Britain's
&lt;Hambros Bank Ltd>.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     BY SUSAN ZEIDLER, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retailers posted stronger than
expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
first half of 1987.
     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
Greenstein.
    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
   Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
3.6 pct increase last year.
     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
transitory month between winter and spring.
    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
by severe weather.
    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
according to retailers and analysts.
    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
high levels of consumer debt.
     May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were
among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
last month.
    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"
said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
    Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
&lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were
strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
than a year ago.
    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel

<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it has
acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a
pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy.
    Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three
of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity
disorders, hyperuricemia and gout.
    The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15
mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of
30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price.
    Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in
initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval process.  It said the investment should provide the
necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and
provide a marketing outlet for the drugs.
    The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,
for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the
often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ
transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for
treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of
high levels of uric acid in the body.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was
critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the
world and said that progress was being made.
    "It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's
promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
for growth," he told the Eastern Economic Association.
    Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
fronts. "Federal Reserve monetary policy, the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the
Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
right direction," he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,
France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.
    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise
numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National
Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
interest rates stable.
    "This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
federal spending," he said.
    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.
    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against "quick fix"
solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
or protectionist trade legislation.
    "What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine
economic growth," he said.
    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow
for its gradual resolution over time.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY SAYS NO COMMENT ON YEN VALUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Treasury Department spokesman
refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary
of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the
Japanese yen was undervalued.
    Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told
an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit
undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."
    Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials
were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making
any comment on them.
    Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said
he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced"
against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the
dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.
    But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner
said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.
    The United States and major trade allies West Germany,
France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to
discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Trustco Ltd> said it does not
plan to enter the brokerage business when ownership of Ontario
investment dealers is opened to other financial institutions on
June 30.
    "The short answer is no, we do not intend to get directly
into the brokerage business, but we will compete with it,"
chief executive Michael Cornelissen told the annual meeting in
reply to a shareholder's inquiry.
    Cornelissen said Royal Trust, Canada's second biggest trust
company, was concerned about a possible conflict of interest
between its current asset management functions and brokerage
and stock promotion activities.
    Cornelissen also cited the heavy competition in the
Canadian securities industry as a factor in Royal Trust's
decision to avoid direct involvement in a brokerage firm.
    He told shareholders, however, that Royal Trust would
continue to compete with investment dealers through its asset
management programs and discount processing of retail stock
trades.
    Royal Trust also plans to take further advantage of
networking possibilities offered by its involvement in
financial conglomerate &lt;Trilon Financial Corp>, 50 pct-owner of
Royal Trust, Cornelissen said.
    Afterward, Cornelissen told reporters that Royal Trust's
Dow Financial Services Corp unit planned no more divestitures
after its previously reported agreement yesterday to
restructure its financial operations in Asia with joint owner
&lt;MBF Holdings Ltd>.
    Cornelissen also told reporters the company was confident
of achieving its targeted 15 pct growth in earnings per share
this year. Royal Trust's basic per share earnings rose 16 pct
in 1986 to 2.20 dlrs.
    "With two months of the year gone, we are ahead of it (the
15 pct growth target)," he said.

<TITLE>CADBURY REQUESTS STOCK EXCHANGE ENQUIRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cadbury-Schweppes Plc &lt;CADB.L> said it
had asked the London Stock Exchange to launch a formal enquiry
into dealings in the company's shares in recent months.
    It said it believed such a move was in the best interests
of shareholders following recent charges being made under U.K.
Insider dealing laws about the shares.
    Last week, former &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> executive
Geoffrey Collier was charged with insider dealing in Cadbury
shares.
    Collier resigned from the bank last year and was later
charged with offences on deals in shares of AE Plc &lt;AENG.L>.
    A Stock Exchange spokeswoman said she could give no
specific details about the request. An investigation would be
requested from the Exchange as it had access to the relevant
dealing records.
    If it appeared that some offence had been committed details
would be passed to the U.K. Trade Department, which had the
power to bring charges under the Companies' Act.
    No spokesman for Cadbury was immediately available for
comment.

LIBRA BANK EXPECTS BRAZIL TO REACH DEBT ACCORD LONDON, March 5
- London-based &lt;Libra Bank Plc> said when announcing its 1986
annual results that it expected Brazil to reach agreement with
its creditors over debt repayments.
    "In recent years Brazil has demonstrated its ability to
generate surpluses sufficient to service its debt, and I have
no doubt that, in due course, it will reach an agreement with
the banks and its other creditors," Libra managing director
Peter Belmont said in a statement.
    Earlier the bank, which specialises in providing finance to
Latin America and the Caribbean, announced pretax profits of
43.9 mln stg for calendar 1986, against 43 mln in 1985.
    Libra's net worth increased by 24 pct to 134 mln stg last
year, and Belmont said the improvement to the bank's balance
sheet was due to profits being mostly retained in the bank, and
to the issue of 10 mln stg of cumulative redeemable preference
shares during the year.
    Libra is a consortium bank --National Westminster Bank Plc
&lt;NWBL.L>, Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. &lt;CMB>, Royal Bank of Canada
&lt;RY.TO>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z>, Westdeutsche Landesbank

downgraded 225 mln dlrs of debt of Beverly Enterprises.
    Cut were the company's senior debt to BB-minus from BB and
subordinated debt to B-plus from BB-minus. The implied senior
secured debt rating is BB.
    S and P said the action reflected Beverly's aggressive
plans to repurchase stock that would increase financial risk
while earnings prospects become more clouded.
    Despite the planned use of proceeds from asset sales for a
portion of the buy back's costs, decapitalization would raise
adjusted debt leverage above the 75 pct level of recent years.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL PROMISES VACCINE AID PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration soon will
propose a program of no-fault compensation for people injured
by childhood vaccines, a senior Treasury Department counsel
told the House select revenue measures subcommittee.
    "Within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a program
that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured
persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for
vaccine manufacturers," Dennis Ross, tax legislative counsel for
treasury, said in prepared testimony.
    The Vaccine Act was signed into law last year but did not
include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.
    Ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious
long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for
diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.
    But he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like Wyeth
Laboratories and Parke, Davis and Co to stop producing
childhood vaccines.
    The administration would not favor funding compensation

a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.

<TITLE>ICI &lt;ICI> SEES GROWTH IN PHARMACEUTICALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow  
to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years
compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson
told financial analysts.
    "Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new
product each year," Henderson said.
    He also said research and development spending in this
business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales
income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.
    ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of
sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on
15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs
on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.
    Sales in the United States totaled about three billion
dlrs, ICI executives said.
    In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will
come from ICI's research and development activities, but the
company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition
program.
    ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions
during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase
of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and
coatings company, from &lt;Hanson Trust PLC>.
    ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's
borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling,
1.5 billion of which have already been used.
    While the company has no current plans for a major
acquisition, "we are ready to move quickly in the acquisition
field if the need arises," Clements said.

<TITLE>ROTTERDAM PORT SUBSIDY TO END JULY 1 - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de
Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder
labour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector
as from July 1.
    Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not
settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.
    The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,
Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and
added there was now no alternative to proceeding with
redundancy plans.
    The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19
in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from
the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.
    Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss
figures given for the port for this year.
    The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,
put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985
at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around
30 mln.
    The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and
said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their
plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.

expects a loss of about two mln dlrs in its third quarter ended

    S.A.Y said its board of directors approved the unit's sale
because Omnilab was losing about 140,000 dlrs a quarter.
    "We no longer see a near-term prospect for a reasonable
return on our investment," Romilly Humphries, S.A.Y. president

    S.A.Y. said proceeds from the sale would be used to
increase the company's market share in automotive products
packaging and diversify its packaging capabilities.

to consolidate and diversify Arab-African relations, the
Moroccan news agency MAP reported.
    N'Diaye said the ADB intends to increase its capital by 200
per cent by next June. This will allow it to invest about eight
billion dollars in the next five years, he said..

<TITLE>STRIKING BRAZILIAN SEAMEN HOLD PAY TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Striking Brazilian seamen, who say
they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,
today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister
Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.
    Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National
Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks
would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.
    Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.
    The union official said the strike had halted a total of
158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and
about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.
    Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,
Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.
    Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to
the government, which has already had to suspend interest
payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic
deterioration in the country's trade balance.
    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil
newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships
could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.
    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is
not conceivable that exports be hit," he said.
    "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are
going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,
and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbema
said.
    A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the
scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said
movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its
normal level of 12 ships a day.
    He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor
on moored in the harbour.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON WARNS U.S. BANKS ON LDC RIGIDITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that some U.S. banks have been too rigid in
talks with lesser developed countries on debt refinancings and
warned that a breakdown of the renegotiation process could be
harmful.
    "There have been some difficulties in those negotiations ...
banks have sometimes been too rigid," Johnson said in response
to a question during an address before the Eastern Economic
Association, an academic group.
    "I think there have been potential breakdowns in that
process," he said, adding that an actual breakdown "would be very
unfortunate."
    He declined to comment on the situation of specific nations
and said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in such
talks.
    However, he said it was "always a little bit risky" for a
heavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without first
negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on economic
reforms. He added that he remains optimistic that current talks
would be resolved successfully.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said the rapid recent growth in corporate and
household debt burdens posed risks to the economy but should be
kept in perspective.
    The heavy debt load "is one of our major concerns ... the
risks are significant," he said in response to questions from
the Eastern Economic Association, an academic group.
    However, he added, the recent bull market on Wall Street
had also made corporate equity levels soar, keeping corporate
debt to equity ratios about constant.
    Similarly, he said household net worth has increased at a
faster pace than household debt "so that household debt-to-asset
ratios have once again gone down."
    Nonetheless, "I think that it's something to watch
carefully, and obviously it's something we do," he said.

<TITLE>YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A reduction of the U.S. federal budget
deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly
inter-releated now.
    "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
trade deficit down."
    He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
the two deficits.
    Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.
budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser
extent, other U.S. securities as well.
    "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"
Yeutter said.
    He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary
policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and
the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.
    The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve
under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the
trade situation by getting interest rates down.
    On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is
still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough
progress toward reducing that deficit.
    In the international area, he said that "our major trading
partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."
Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is
just not doing the job on the import side."
    Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of
Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.
    In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored
meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that
the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
    "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and
other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.
trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."
    Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
    He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to
legislate a solution to the trade problem."
    Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.
    "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
essential in solving international trade problems.

<TITLE>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK HEAD SAYS BRAZIL MORATORIUM TEMPORARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank president Barber Conable
said he believed that Brazil would come up with a medium term
economic plan and that the current debt moritorium would be
temporary.
    Speaking briefly to reporters following an address before
the Export-Import Bank, Conable said that the bank had been
urging the Brazilian government to come up with a specific plan
designed to work the country out of its present economic
difficulty.
    "Brazil would like to come up with such a plan," he said,
adding: "the moritorium is likely to be a temporary affair."
    During his formal remarks, Conable made it clear that he
believed Brazil must take some specific internal action.
    He said "they have everyone's attention but it must be
followed by a construtive plan."
    He said that he expected Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who he met with last week to discuss the Brazilian debt
suspension action, to return for further discussion but did not
currently have a specific meeting arranged.
    Conable also told the gathering of mostly commericial
bankers that in order for the Baker debt initiative to work all
parties to the program must be on board.

<TITLE>TANDEM COMPUTERS &lt;TNDM> SEES HIGHER NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tandem Computers Inc said it expects
higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter
ending March 31 against a year ago.
    "We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the
quarter," James Treybig, president and and chief executive
officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.
    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned
9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln
dlrs.
    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the
quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for
the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln
dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is
traditionally slower than the first.
    L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen
estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per
share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker
to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned
1.44 dlrs a share.
    Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company,
said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United
States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions
are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said.
    The executive said Tandem will increase its research and
development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87
mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    He said the company plans to introduce several products,
including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL
programming language, an industry standard. Tandem also won a
major order from the &lt;Bank of Tokyo>.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
on agricultural trade.
    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
agriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.
    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told the
meeting.
    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
justification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. He
listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
peanuts, cotton and sugar.
    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
GATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the very
beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".
    "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
their programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.
    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay
round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,
tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as
manufactured goods.

<TITLE>VW EXPECTS FURTHER FALL IN U.S. SALES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> expects
currency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S. Sales in
1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in
1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said.
    Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S.
Market as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it would
be able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales.
    In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>,
delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outside
of West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told a
regular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce.
    Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally become
more difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and
fiercer competition in the region.
    Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales. But he said
car sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined would
probably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record
2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passed
their peak for this business cycle.
    Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growth
were becoming apparent on the VW group's most important markets
but there were no grounds for great worries.
    The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, had
entered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incoming
orders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.
    Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also said
VW currently had no plans for further increases in its
workforce.
    He told the plant's workforce that an
internationally-active company like VW must be able to adjust
to changed economic conditions and manage situations in which
unfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial
maneuver.
    Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share in
order to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of
its foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East.
    This could only be done if capital-intensive plants were
used as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were
raised through comprehensive training and if working hours were
arranged so that expensive production plants operated as
efficiently and soundly as possible.
    The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to push
for a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germany
industry this year.
    Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told the
same Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35
hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.
    He said the works council was prepared to negotiate on
making working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both
the company and the workforce.
    A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 for
a 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in a
compromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each
company in the industry to decide, in consultation with the
workforce, how the reductions should be made.

<TITLE>HAUGHEY TO SEEK EC ADVICE ON IRISH DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charles Haughey, leader of the Irish
party Fianna Fail, said if he becomes prime minister following
last month's Irish general election, he will seek the advice of
the EC Commission on management of the country's 24 billion
punt foreign debt.
    Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being
asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next
Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17
poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt
management was made to him today by Commission president
Jacques Delors.
    Haughey said:" Delors assured me we could have full recourse
to the Commission for advice, guidance and expert skills in
dealing with our overall financial problems, particularily in
the matter of debt management."
    Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion
punts a year, he added :"If we could achieve any significant
improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of
servicing, it could have significant budgetary benefits."
    He added that he would seek advice, not a Community loan.
    However, Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its
position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at
favorable interest rates, notably for onlending to its farming
sector.
    "It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before
and we would look at it again," he said.
     Haughey said he regarded as "almost paramount" the
maintenance of the punt's current position within the European
Monetary System.
    He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government
in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight
pct last August.
    "Until 1983, the policy of the Irish government was to was
to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I
believe that policy was right," Haughey said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House Agriculture Committee meeting
later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
said.
    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
the bill, committee staffers said.
    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
necessary.
    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
should be extended to other crops.
    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
changes in the farm bill.
    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
timing," a congressional staff member said.
    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
feedgrains.

takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.
    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
succeed.
    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
    "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.
    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if USAir rejected his offer.
    "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said
one arbitrager.
    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work," said one analyst.
    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    However, other analysts speculated the managements of
Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
into TWA.

<TITLE>BAKER INT'L &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baker International Corp treasurer Eric
Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed
merger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what
compromises might be acceptable to it.
    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr
oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when
Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent
decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.
    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting
called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said
it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.
    Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did
not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until
after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were
sold.
    Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.
    "The company's position is we would like to see the merger
be completed, which is in the best interests of our
shareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said.
    "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the
litigation, I can't go any further than that," he said.
    Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday
to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent
decree.
    Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors
of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the
merger.

<TITLE>TRW &lt;TRW> PROMISES TO CORRECT CONTRACT PRACTICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of TRW, inc said his
company had overcharged the government on defense contracts but
promised to prevent the improper conduct from recurring.
    "There were a number of instances of mischarging and other
irregularities in TRW's defense contracting business," TRW
chairman Ruben Mettler said in testimony to the House Oversight
subcommittee.
    "As the person ultimately responsible for the management of
TRW, I am determined to do everything in my power to prevent
any recurrence," Mettler said.
    TRW holds over 3 billion dlrs in defense contracts.
    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,
said TRW was being sued by the Justice Department and was being
investigated by federal grand juries in Colorado and Cleveland.
    Mettler said the overcharges had been uncovered by TRW's
internal procedures and all were reported to the government.
    "In every case we advised the government of our findings and
committed to make restitution. We immediately put a stop to the
practices in question and disciplined those who were culpable,"
he said.
    Mettler said TRW had hired a new chief financial officer, a
vice president of internal audit and a corporate controller. He
said the internal audit department was being strengthened and a
corporate review board had been established to monitor
compliance activities.
    He said a business ethics and conduct council had also been
created and over 15,000 managers and employees would be given
training programs on contract compliance.

<TITLE>OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman
said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been
delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec
prices.
    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from
Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in
February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were
strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"
he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they
are committed to making the accord work," he said.
    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He
said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these
figures.
    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated
that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
said; "That could well be correct."
    Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying
group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it
gave no figures.
    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output
may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around
16 mln bpd.
    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.
    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all
produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said
it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December
pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
    Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that
in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
country were coming under price pressure because they were
currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and
the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.
    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that
demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
    "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is
now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he
expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after
early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand
for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.
    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela
and Indonesia were having less problems with output than
producers like his own country because they exported oil
products.
    Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec
pricing system, he said.
    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually
have to buy Opec oil.
    "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
later on," he said.
    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being
pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
seemed weak.
    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
for Opec at the moment.
    "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said.
"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
working, not dealing with a differential of cents between
grades."
    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over
the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON SEES INTEREST RATES STABLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said he does not see increasing pressure on
interest rates but said the Fed would watch out for
developments that could push them higher.
    Johnson said that it was too early to tell if recent
indicators on the economy contradicted Fed expectations of
continued modest growth.
    "We are not anticipating any problems or see increased
interest rate pressures," Johnson told reporters after a speech
to the Eastern Economic Association.
    However, Johnson said the Fed would be alert to an
excessive depreciation in the dollar, a rise in bond yields,
increases in commodity prices, or other variables.
    "We would have to pay attention," he said.
    Recent indicators on retail sales and factory orders that
indicated weakness in the economy could be presenting an
inaccurate picture, Johnson said.
    The more recent data are too caught up in statistical
adjustment problems having to do with the end of the year and
the beginning of the year, he said.
    Asked if the Fed was continuing to be generous with
reserves, Johnson said, "We have accommodated reasonable,
non-inflationary real growth."
    He said the Fed was able to do that because of the decline
in inflation expectations and monetary velocity.
    "I don't think we can be accused of being too generous," he
added.

<TITLE>U.S HOUSE LEADER URGES FARM CREDIT RECUE CAUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Majority leader Thomas Foley
(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system a
few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a
federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.
    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, told
Reuters that while Foley believes action will be necessary
later this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not
necessarily needed immediately.
    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadership
who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under
consideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,
last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren said
his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's
regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the system
itself ask for aid.
    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has 
expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to
wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform
itself, farm credit sources said.

facility to deal with third world debt.
    He said in a statement the facility would purchase debt of

the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as collateral to
for the necessary financial banking to issue debt instruments.
    LaFalce, a member of the House Banking Committee, said the
facility was needed because most American banks were refusing
to fund more foreign debt and debtor countries were having
trouble paying the loans on schedule.

<TITLE>CUBAN CATTLE THREATENED BY DROUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAVANA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering
the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a
prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle
producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.
    The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the
island's number two province in milk production. Granma said
20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.
    The newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed and
the cattle are being rounded up.
    Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane
conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned
before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the
residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have
been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.
    Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef
rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,
each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every
18 days.
    In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no
rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are
parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of
silage projected in its annual plan.
    Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than
50 pct of normal precipitation.

<TITLE>U.S. TO SET ORANGE JUICE DUTIES MONDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commerce Department on Monday
will set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from
Brazil, department officials said.
    A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last Oct 17 on the
imports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. Commerce's
ruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of more
detailed cost information, industry officials said.
    The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis,
pending a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring the
domestic orange industry.
    The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domestic
industry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports.
    A complaint that the Brazilian imports were being dumped at
below costs on the U.S. market was filed on behalf of U.S.
growers by the Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland, Fla., group,
Alcoma Packing Co, Inc, and Barry Citrus Products.
    U.S. officials say about half of the orange juice consumed
in the United States comes from Brazil.

extension of a federal deadline for installation of "automatic
occupant protection systems" on all cars beyond the current
September, 1989, target.
    GM previously said it would offer airbags as optional

<TITLE>RADTECH &lt;RADT> BOARD REMOVES CHAIRMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Radtech Inc said its board has
removed Ronald G. Williams as chairman and chief executive
officer and has elected President Samuel A. Francis chief
exeuctive officer.
    Williams is the majority owner of &lt;Forum Cos Inc>. On
December 12, Radtech exchanged 10 mln of its shares for 20,000
Forum shares. Of the 10 mln, 7.5 mln went to Williams and 2.5
mln to Forum's other owner, &lt;Audley Inc>. In addition to the 10
mln shares involved in this transaction, Radtech has 9.9 mln
shares outstanding.
    On January 27, Radtech said, it announced an agreement to
rescind the Forum transaction.
    Radtech said six mln of its shares held by Williams and the
20,000 Forum shares were turned over to Radtech's attorney's.
Subsequent to the rescission agreement, however, Williams and
Audley have refused to recognize Radtech's position that a
recission has occurred, it said.
    On March 3, the company said, its attorneys filed an action
in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico
giving control of both blocks of stock to the court and asking
it to rule on the recission.
    Radtech said it intends to defend its position in the legal
proceeding, which names the company, Williams and Audley, that
the rescission has occurred, that all 10 mln shares it issued
should be returned, and that the 600,000 dlrs of Radtech funds
used by Forum should be returned.
    The company also said a dispute exists whether Williams
continues to serve on its board.

<TITLE>CANADA DLR DRIVEN BY FOREIGN BUYERS - WILSON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson said
large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the
country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp
recovery in the Canadian dollar.
    He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and
the United States, is the result of "confidence in the
direction this country is going in."
    "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is
higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when
it was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commons
daily question period.
    Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a
record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than
double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5
billion dlrs in the market.
    Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a
possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment
abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign
companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from
6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would
generate many new jobs in Canada.

<DATELINE>    HAMMOND, Ind., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northern Indiana Public Service Co
said its five-year construction budget for 1987-1991 will be
793 mln dlrs, almost all of which will be internally generated.
    The utility said in its 1986 annual report that this
budget, primarily for electric and gas equipment and
facilities, is some 57 mln dlrs lower than its estimate a year
ago of spending for 1986-1990. Such spending at its peak was
2.6 billion dlrs for 1980-1984.
    It said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will probably not have a
material effect on its operating results. In December it cut
59.4 mln dlrs from a 135.8 mln dlrs rate request before the
Indiana Public Service Commission because of the affect the tax
act will have on operating results.
    The rate request is still pending, a spokesman said.

<TITLE>CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top U.S. and European farm trade and
government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
imbalance.
    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for
an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
production.
    "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy
Administrator William Bailey said.
    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to
adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance
and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Jean-Claude Paye said.
    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he noted.
    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of
Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take
greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
    However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to
take account of large disparities in the situation around the
EC, he said.
    "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
Community," he said.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA WILL REPROGRAM SIX BILLION DLRS IN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's recent agreement with its
creditor banks reprograms six billion dlrs of its 21 billion
dlr public sector foreign debt rescheduling and reduces
repayments due between 1987 and 1992, Finance Minister Manuel
Azpurua said.
    Azpurua was commenting in a television interview on
Friday's agreement to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over
Libor from 1-1/8 pct and extend the period to 14 years from
12-1/2.
    He said in addition to the reduction in amortizations over
the next three years sought by the government, agreed at 1.35
billion dlrs instead of 3.335 billion, Venezuela will also pay
less in the subsequent three years. The accord runs till 1999.
    Azpurua said that in 1990, payments of restructured debt
are lowered to 1.05 billion dlrs from 1.339 mln, to 1.25
billion from 1.994 mln in 1991 and to 1.45 billion from 2.403
billion in 1992.
    He said the contingency clause implemented by Venezuela
soon after the original rescheduling was signed in February
1986 stays in effect and that the new payment schedule is based
on an assumption of oil prices varying between 15 and 18 dlrs a
barrel.
    Venezuela, hit by a 40 pct drop in oil income last year,
had sought a direct link between repayments and the level of
oil income, but banks resisted on the grounds this could create
a dangerous precedent for other Latin American debtors.
    Azpurua said the new terms have been telexed to Venezuela's
450 creditor banks for acceptance with information on
government plans to draw up debt capitalization rules and
return to the capital markets.
    Public finances director Jorge Marcano said the government
plans to issue dollar, mark and yen denominated bonds this year
for amounts varying between 100 and 150 mln dlrs.
    He noted that some existing Republic of Venezuela bond
issues are maturing, and that the government intends to replace
them with new issues to maintain its presence in the capital
markets and encourage new investments through an enhanced
credit image.

making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant
last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding.
    Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the

<TITLE>FARM CREDIT RESCUE CAUTION URGED BY HOUSE LEADER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Majority leader Thomas Foley
(D-Wash.) has urged Congress to give the farm credit system a
few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a
federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to Foley said.
    Gene Moos, agricultural aide to the Majority leader, told
Reuters while Foley believes action will be necessary later
this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not
necessarily needed immediately.
    Foley's view appears to differ with the Senate leadership
who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under
consideration before Congress breaks for Easter April 9.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,
last week pledged to consider a bill before Easter. Boren said
his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's
regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) nor the system
itself ask for aid.
    Chairman of the FCA Frank Naylor, like Foley, has 
expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to
wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform
itself, farm credit sources said.
    "He (Foley) is willing to give Mr. Naylor some time in this
regard," Moos said.
    Moos predicted Congress will begin serious action on a
rescue package sometime this summer. Any package of legislation
is unlikely to include large federal outlays of money, he said.
    "I  don't see a big infusion of federal bucks," said Moos,
adding that the more likely outcome will be federal guarantees
of borrower stock and bonds held by investors.

<TITLE>UNION CARBIDE &lt;UK> SAYS LONG TERM DEBT RISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DANBURY, Conn., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Carbide Corp said its 1986
long term debt was 3.06 billion dlrs compared to 1.71 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    The company released its audited 1986 results.
    The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
its battery products, home and automobile products and
agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
mln dlrs.
    The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
year.
    Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
also unchanged.
    Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
    In the audited results released today, the company broke
down results by business segment.
    Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
    In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
    In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the
company, adding, "While all this was going on, our continuing
businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
profit improvement over 1985."
    Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
    Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
the year.
    The company's specialties and services segment cut its
losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
    Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
mln dlrs in the year.
    The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
    Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
mln dlrs.
    By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services
to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.
    At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln
dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln
dlrs from 168 mln dlrs.
    The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at
year end from 430 mln dlrs at year end 1985, after a net
decrease of 131 mln dlrs during 1986.
    Current assets at year-end fell to 2.41 billion dlrs from
4.43 billion dlrs and current liabilities fell to 1.88 billion
dlrs from 2.38 billion.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shell Francaise &lt;SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of
&lt;Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the
first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln
francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in
1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.
    The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved
strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs
against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved
performances by its main profit centres.
    It said the results could have been even better had it not
been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in
the last quarter of the year.
    In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against
14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.
    The company said the results were in line with its targets
for the second year of its three-year recovery programme.
    Meanwhile, &lt;Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to
profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net
profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln. No
other details were available.

<TITLE>PORK DELEGATES VOTE ON FARM BILL, FARM CREDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delegates from the National Pork
Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress
in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S.
congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no
specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices
directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.
    Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said "to have
unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very
difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."
    Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but
that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for
legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.
    Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that
Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify
problems in the farm credit system.
    Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice
President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a
program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a 
resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.
    Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will
work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save
or create any one credit system.

<TITLE>CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability to
limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above
yesterday's closing prices, according to analysts.
    They also said the heating oil contract found additional
support from a short-covering rally on the close.
    April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April
heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.
    "Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from
yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that
OPEC is producing within its quota," said Simon Greenshields, a
vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.
    News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman
statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its
official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices,
traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early
March was 14.7 mln bpd.
    In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support
from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as
well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as
refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.
    Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to
51.24 cts a gallon.

<TITLE>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in
the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since
August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's
level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said
sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported
under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for
delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR
Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.
    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales
to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.
    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and
151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from
the previous week's combined sales, it said.
    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for
delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by
30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000
tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the
preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week
average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico
and Italy, it said.
    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4
times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less
than the four week average.
    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and
Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown
destinations.
    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of
increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for
unknown destinations.
    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales
-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the
1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good
showing, the department said.
    Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea,
Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia
were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins
August 1.

<TITLE>MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE DUQUESNE LIGHT &lt;DQU> DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade Duquesne Light Co's two billion dlrs of debt.
    Moody's said it would assess the likely financial
consequences of the 19 mln dlr rate reduction ordered today by
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
    The unexpected order raises significant doubts about the
quality of Duquesne's regulatory support and financial
prospects. The Commission's determination that Perry Unit 1's
power is not needed could depress Duquesne's earnings and cash
flow well into the future. Duqusne has Baa-1 senior debt and
preferred stock and Baa-2 debentures and preference stock.

<TITLE>COFFEE FALL NOT SEEN AFFECTING COLOMBIA'S DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The sharp fall in international coffee
prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation,
finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.
    He said the current depression on world coffee markets was
not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
Colombia's financial state which he described as sound.
    "Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the
foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"
he said.
    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
of 13.6 billion dlrs.
    Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week
from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade
union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower
coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs
in revenues for 1987.
    Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american
bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of
3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,
which he said was approved.

<TITLE>HUMANA &lt;HUM> DECLARES SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Humana Inc said its board
approved a shareholder rights plan, or so-called poison pill
plan, to ensure its shareholders receive fair treatment in the
event of a proposed takeover.
    Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control
of the company.
    Under the plan its board declared a dividend distribution
of one right for each outstanding common share held as of March
16. It said each right entitles holders to purchase a unit of
1/100 of a share of newly authorizes series A participating
preferred at 75 dlrs per unit.
    Humana said the rights become effective after an entity
acquires 20 pct or more of its outstanding common or tenders
for 30 pct of its stock. After such an acquisition, then each
right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or
an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's
exercise price.
    Humana said the rights expire March 4, 1997, unless
redeemed earlier. It said the rights may be redeemed by the
company for one ct per right at any time prior to 10 days
following a public announcement that a 20 pct position has been
acquired.

<TITLE>HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall
Street analysts said.
    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
it was still interested in the merger.
    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
he is not interested.
    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
target other than to rule out Hughes.
    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
going.
    "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace,
analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a
lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40
pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."
    "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"
said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
    "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll,
analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak."
Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
period of time.
    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially."
Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
is lifting.

Armstrong Rubber Co, said it signed agreements with &lt;Condere
Corp> for the sale of its Natchez, Miss. tire plant and its S
and A Truck Tire Sales and Services Corp.
    Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers
said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business.
    Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its
industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp
of Scotsdale, Ariz.
    Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce
outstanding debt.
     Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is
anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will
be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating
company, the company said.
    The closing is scheduled to be concluded by March 31, it
said.

<TITLE>FERC ISSUES TAKE-OR-PAY GAS POLICY PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the 
recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas
contracts between producers and pipelines.
    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment
period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by
Commissioner Charles Stalon.
    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy
statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general
policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be
recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."
    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines
assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the
commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the
remaining costs through their demand rates."
    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming
existing contracts to help spread the impact of these
take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.
    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal
represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the
industry through this difficult period of transition to a more

    Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will
encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay
contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's
transition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to

<TITLE>PESCH UNIT SEEKS BALANCE OF REPUBLIC HEALTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alpha Health Systems Corp, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pesch and Co, said it submitted a
merger proposal to the board of REPH Acquisition Co, the parent
company of Republic Health Corp, which is 64 pct owned by Pesch
interests.
    The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of
Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>, Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.
    Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other
facilities, in 25 states.
    Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company
representatives were not immediately available.
    The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Alpha and that the existing REPH common
stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.
    REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate
terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.
    Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged
buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal
shareholder of Pesch and Co.
    Alpha recently submitted a second offer to acquire the
stock of American Medical International Inc (AMI) at 22 dlrs a
share in cash and securities, which is still being considered
by American Medical's board, Pesch said.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Spar Aerospace Ltd>, reporting a
sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and
revenue growth during the next five years.
    "Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its
continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based
communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to
significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five
years," the company said.
    It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased
order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from
223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.
    Spar added that lower development costs in the
communications group and a return to normal operations in gears
and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious
drain on profits" this year.
    It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications
group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new
products and market development, a four-month strike at its
Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from
customers to start work on new programs.

Democratic taxwriters to a general idea of raising 18 billion
dlrs in unspecified taxes for the 1988 financial year.
    Wright met with House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan

broached by the House Budget Committee to spread 36 billion
dlrs deficit reduction through 9 billion dlrs in domestic cuts,
9 billion dlrs in defense spending and the rest in tax hikes.
"They are realists," Wright said of the tax writers after the

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Food and Commercial Workers Union
Local 222 rejected a new contract proposal from Iowa Beef
Processors Inc and remain out of work, union spokesman Allen
Zack said.
    In mid-December, Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental
Petroleum Corp, closed its beef processing plant at Dakota
City, Nebraska, because it said "it had no alternative to
threats by meatpackers to disrupt operations."
    About 2,800 UFCWU members are affected by what the union
terms as a lockout.  A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant
expired December 13.
    Zack said IBP's proposal included elimination of a two-tier
wage structure, a 60 cent an hour wage cut for slaughterers and
a 45 cent an hour wage reduction for processors.
    The new proposal also included a bonus system of 1,000 dlrs
for workers who had been at the plant for two years, Zack said.
The annual turnover rate at the facility is 100 pct, he said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>USG Corp is raising 200 mln dlrs
through an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.77 pct,
said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-3/4 pct coupon and were priced at
99.784 to yield 120 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct
Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-1 by
Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund starting
in 1998 to retire five pct of the debentures annually can be
increased by 150 pct at the company's option, giving them
estimated average lives of 20.5 or 14.5 years, Salomon said.

joint economic commission as part of efforts to promote
commercial links and industrial cooperation between the two
countries.
    The French Finance Ministry said the commission, to be
composed of businessmen, was agreed during talks between
Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir and Yugoslavian minister
without portfolio Egon Padovan.
    A ministry statement said both sides had agreed on the need
to boost trade links in keeping with an accord signed last year
calling for a 50 pct rise in commercial exchanges between the
two countries over the next six years.
    French trade with Yugoslavia has grown little over the past

advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
"poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
purchasers.
    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
other relief.
    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,
suppliers, creditors, and customers.
    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market
accumulations by Waste Management or others."
    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
common.
    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
prior to their exercise date.
    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
March 20.

<TITLE>GARN FEARS RUN ON SAVINGS AND LOAN DEPOSITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said a delay
in rescuing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp risked
a run on thrift deposits by nervous customers.
    Garn told a Georgetown University conference on financial
institutions that news reports that the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp was technically in deficit were true and
urged swift congressional action to strengthen the fund.
    Garn said his office received calls from individuals
worried about the safety of their money. "The runs have started,"
Garn, a member of the Banking Committee, said.
    Legislation to infuse more money into the fund which
insures savings deposits was to be voted on today by the
committee but was postponed because of last-minute differences.
    FSLIC has reserves of two billion dlrs but faces potential
claims of 15 billion dlrs, Garn said.
    He said the claims would not come all at once, however, and
dismissed any real danger to deposits at federally insured
thrifts up to the insurance level of 100,000 dlrs.
    "People's money is safe," Garn said, but he added, "We need to
quiet down the situation and put their fear to bed."
    Garn said he and Committee Chairman William Proxmire
(D-Wis) agree on the need for legislation but they differed
over strategy.
    Garn opposes including other issues in the legislation and
would prefer a bill that was limited to restoring FSLIC and
giving regulators more power to cope with failing banks and
thrifts.
    Proxmire's bill also would prohibit new so-called nonbank
banks and thrifts which use a regulatory loophole to operate
outside the usual legal limits on traditional banks.
    William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp, told the conference that if that fund were
combined with FSLIC they could have 29 billion dlrs and cover
contingencies for both the bank and thrift industries.
    However, political differences make a merger of the two
federal funds unlikely, Isaac, now president of the Secura
Group, a consulting firm, said.
    By the 1990's the financial industry will include a handful
of nationwide institutions offering every type of financial
service which evolved from today's banks, nontraditional
financial firms and industrial companies.

Funaro will extend his international tour, flying to Japan for
talks with government officials and representatives of banks to

109-billion dlrs foreign debt, Finance Ministry sources said.
    Funaro, who is in Rome today, will fly to Tokyo on Sunday,

France, England, Italy, West Germany and Switzerland.
    Brazil halted payment of interest rates on 68 billion dlrs

    Funaro, who is accompanied by Central Bank governor

    In Tokyo, however, he is due to meet private bankers, to

<TITLE>CONAGRA &lt;CAG> TO ACQUIRE MONFORT &lt;MMFT></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GREELEY, Colo., March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>ConAgra Inc agreed to acquire
Monfort of Colorado Inc in a stock transaction, both companies
said.
    According to the letter of intent signed by the companies,
ConAgra will acquire all of Monfort's 4.3 mln outstanding
shares for 10.75 mln of its own shares.
    Based on ConAgra's closing price of 34 dlrs today, the
transaction is worth about 356.5 mln dlrs. The merger is
expected to be completed in June, they said.
    The companies said the acquisition will result in a
restatement of ConAgra's earnings for the fiscal year ending
May 31, but the restatement is not expected to materially
change the previously reported, or upcoming, fiscal year-end
earnings. In fiscal 1986, ConAgra had net income of 105.3 mln
dlrs on sales of 5.9 billion dlrs.
    For its fiscal year ending August 1986, Monfort reported
25.1 mln dlrs in earnings on sales of 1.6 billion dlrs. The
company is one of the largest lamb and beef producers in the
U.S., producing, transporting and selling the products
domestically and internationally.

<TITLE>HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Key members of the House Agriculture
committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a
pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a
broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,
Congressional sources said.
    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn
English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support
an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm
(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop
winter and spring wheat.
    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original
proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987
wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the
subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed
until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
and 0/92.
    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program
follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,
and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
to study the implications of a broad 0/92.
    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a
House Agriculture committee member.
    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a
broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House
Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
of an overall deficit reduction package.
    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may
exceed one billion dlrs.
    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the
Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
estimate it would result in significant budget savings.
    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all
1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5
billion dlrs over five years.
    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the
approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
    Some officials said it already is late for implementation
of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
wheat and feedgrains.
    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either
would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.

<TITLE>FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration wants to
encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not
believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.
    "It seems to me that more trade between us is better than
less trade," he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.
    To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign
policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the
Soviet Union to lapse, he said.
    Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining
export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited
items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.
    Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that
comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.
    U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries
that restrict emigration and other rights.
    "What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet
Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends," he said.
    But, he added: "We don't know if they will continue, we
don't know how significant they will be."

<TITLE>PARADYNE &lt;PDN> PLEADS GUILTY TO CRIMINAL CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LARGO, Fla, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paradyne Corp said it pleaded guilty
to criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the Social
Security Administration and agreed to pay 1.2 mln dlrs in fines
and costs to the U.S. Government.
    The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1
mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.
    About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
said.
     The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
    The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
    Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
derivative lawsuit.
    For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
    Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
settlement of the indictment.
    Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
    The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
optimistic about the outlook for the year.
    For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
    Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
Administration.
    The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.
 
   Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.
    The charges would then be dropped if the defendants
successfully complete the probation period. Details of the
requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.

to federal income and price supports.
    Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that the
government could get out of guaranteeing minimum support prices
if farmers systematically used options contracts to protect
themselves against vacillating market prices.
    "With agricultural options now available, there is less need
for government price support programs to provide price
stability for farmers," the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank, said in a recent position paper.
    "Washington no longer needs to restrict the level and
variability of commodity market prices. Farmers and others in
agribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by
trading in option markets," the paper, written by Clemson
University professor Kandice Kahl, said.
    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the
benefits of price support programs without entailing the cost
to taxpayers.
    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy "put" options in order to
obtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private
seller of the option contract.
    "This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows
him to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,
by foregoing his option," Kahl said.
    Interest in promoting understanding of options trading
among farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed
change in agricultural policy that would have the effect of
exposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations
in income subsidies.
    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and
a cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive
at least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how
much they planted.
    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price
stabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency
payments, equal to the difference between a set target price
and the higher of the support price or market price.
    The so-called decoupling plan, or "0/92", would aim to
curtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that
farmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.
    Critics of "0/92" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded
in curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and
deficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to
plant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the
forefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage
plantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment
with a fixed and gradually declining payment.
    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of
offering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.
    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by
the notion of having the federal government subsidize the
purchase of "call" options to help farmers hedge their income
risk.
    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right
to buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price
rose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the
option and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up
most of the reduction in the deficiency payment.
    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer
legislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might
have to await the results of a pilot project on futures and
options trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.
    The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at
least 40 counties which produce major program crops.
    The program, only recently launched, was designed to
encourage producers to participate in futures and options
markets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not
fall below the county loan level for the crops in question.

    The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce

    The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger
plan is midnight tonight.
    Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and
holds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while
awaiting federal approval of the merger plan.
    The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or
the other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on
the request for reconsideration.
    If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it is
expected to reinstate the divestiture order.

<TITLE>BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's recent announcement of a
suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
among many international economists and commodities analysts
that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
    The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo
Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
Econometrics, said.
    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
foreign exchange markets more profitable.
    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
rates," Roldan said.
    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
billion dlrs.
    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they
have good foreign marketing channels."
    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
market this year with a vengeance.
    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
each other of intransigence.
    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.
    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
would suffer.
    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
dealer said.
    "If they do come into the market at this level it will go
lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"
he said.
    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
the ICO talks on export quotas.
    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They
will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"
according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
they can't afford to store the crops," he said.
    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
about large South American crops developing under near ideal
conditions towards record yields.
    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.
    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
loan.
    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But
he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
as it can this year because of its economic situation.
    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The
Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
storage," he added.
    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
it would not make a big difference.
    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
muted no matter its need to generate capital.
    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
find many more markets for it," one analyst said.
    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels
per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the
previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter
1986, the International Energy Agency said.
    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings
were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest
monthly oil market report.
    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to
fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for
fixed volumes over an extended period.

    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to
Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been
signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required
liftings.
    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2
mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices
apparently cut February production.
    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the
Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and
0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal
consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.
    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in
February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and
47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.
    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd
OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other
developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd
with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of
non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)
and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.
    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record
1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected
in February in accordance with government curtailments of
approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

<TITLE>ICN &lt;ICN> SUBJECT OF CLASS ACTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two separate class action lawsuits
were filed against ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc and its Viratek Inc
&lt;VIRA> subsidiary, charging the companies with disseminating
allegedly false and misleading information regarding the
company's drug Virazole, which is being tested as a possible
treatment for AIDS.
    The suit, filed in Federal Court here on behalf of ICN
shareholders, charges that disclosures made by ICN over about
the past year encouraged the investing public to believe that
Virazole was a promising drug of major importance and did not
disclose serious adverse side effects, court documents said.
    An ICN spokesman declined comment on the lawsuits.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for
comment.
    Virazole, also known as ribavirin, is undergoing extensive
testing as a possible treatment for AIDS-related illnesses.
    The drug, which is available in a number of countries
outside the United States, has been approved by the FDA for use
domestically in aerosol form as a treatment for an infection
that strikes young children, called respiratory syncytial
virus.
    The FDA and a house subcommittee are conducting their own
separate probes into whether ICN withheld data from the FDA on
adverse reactions to the antiviral drug.
    The Securities and Exchange Commission is also
investigating the company.

<TITLE>ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO FREE REST OF CONTRA AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration issued a
formal statement to Congress designed to free the remaining 40
mln dlrs in 1987 aid for the U.S.-backed "Contra" rebels in
Nicaragua.
    The aid is the last instalment of 100 mln dlrs voted by
Congress for the Contras, and is to be spent on major military
equipment. Congress now has 15 days to disapprove of the 40 mln
dlrs.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We think the
prospects for approval are very good."
    The long-awaited administration move followed by one day
President Reagan's speech to the nation on a report on the
secret Iran arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the
contras.
    In the House of Representatives earlier today, Rep. David
Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters Democratic leaders
in the House had decided to push for a 180-day moratorium on
further aid. He said the House would vote next Wednesday.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Holiday Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday
Corp, is raising 1.4 billion dlrs through offerings of notes
and debentures, said bookrunner Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Junk bond traders said they thought this to be the
second-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market. They said
the biggest was BCI Holdings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on
April 10, 1986.
    Via sole manager Drexel, Holiday Inns is selling 900 mln
dlrs of senior notes due 1994 with a 10-1/2 pct coupon and par
pricing. Non-callable for five years, the notes are rated B-1
by Moody's and B-plus by Standard and Poor's.
    Holiday Inns is also offering 500 mln dlrs of subordinated
debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par pricing. The
debentures are non-callable for three years and non-refundable
for five years, Drexel said as lead manager.
    A sinking fund starts in 1997 to retire 60 pct of the
debentures by maturity. This issue is rated B-2 by Moody's and
B-minus by Standard and Poor's. Goldman Sachs co-managed the
debenture deal.

<TITLE>HUNT GROUP HAS COMDATA STAKE, SEEKS INFLUENCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>An investor group led by members of
the Hunt family of Dallas, Texas, told the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has acquired a 6.2 pct stake in Comdata
Network Inc &lt;CDN> and may try to influence company policy.
    The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it
opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between
Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last
reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company's stock.
    The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire
5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14
dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.
    Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate,
whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has
notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy
between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata's common stock.
    Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of
Comdata's stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over,
unless the FTC gives it early approval.
    Under the proposed Comdata recapitalization plan, the
company would buy up to 10 mln of its common shares at 13.25
dlrs each.
    Mason Best, which belongs to CNI Parnters, a Texas
partnership, would not tender any of its stake under the plan,
but would instead buy another one mln Comdata common shares and
would get representation on the company's board.
    The Hunt group said it has told Comdata that it considers
required payments under the plan, such as a 1.5 mln dlr fee and
the issuance of a warrant to buy 500,000 common shares to be a
waste of the company's assets.
    The Hunt group, which also includes securities Texas firms
Cypress Partners L.P and Driftwood Ltd, said it spent 15.2 mln
dlrs on its 1,197,700 Comdata common shares.

Caputo said.
    Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling in
trade showed the "tangible and immediate results" of a wide-
ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of
both countries last July.
    He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus
700 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two
countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.
    Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from
1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord
said.

<TITLE>SIA TO APPEAL FED RULING ON COMMERCIAL PAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities Industry Association,
SIA, has asked the U.S. supreme court to overturn a lower-court
ruling that would allow banks to sell commercial paper, SIA
general counsel William Fitzpatrick said.
    In a petition, the SIA said the court of appeals erred in
upholding the decision of the Federal Reserve board of
governors to permit Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT> to
underwrite and distribute commercial paper.
    The SIA charged that the Fed's ruling violates the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act barring banks from underwriting most types
of securities.
    The court of appeals decision, issued last December,
reversed an earlier district court ruling that selling
commercial paper is an improper bank activity and that private
placements by banks is also improper.
    In an earlier round of the case, decided in 1984, the
Supreme Court upheld the SIA's contention that commercial paper
is a security for the purposes of th Glass-Steagall Act.
    The SIA is a trade association representing the interests
of more than 500 U.S. investment banks and securities firms.

<TITLE>TALKS FAIL TO END BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay talks aimed at ending a
week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the
strike will continue, a union official said.
    The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships
in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of
the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.
    The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have
rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company
Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of
Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).
    Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro
with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without
resolving the dispute.
    He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands,
Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.
    Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to
the government, which has suspended interest payments on part
of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in
the country's trade balance.
    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike
continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport
Brazilian exports.
    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is
not conceivable that exports be hit," he told the Gazeta
Mercantil newspaper.

<TITLE>VINER &lt;EAVKF> VIABLE AFTER HECK'S &lt;HEX> MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier
reported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc &lt;HEX>, in
which Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect
Viner's capital position or its ability to carry on its
profitable brokerage business.
    Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co
had regulatory capital of 24.5 mln U.S. dlrs at year-end 1986.
    The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,
affect Viner's previously reported legal action to recover
costs from an aborted merger agreement with Heck's.
     It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made
the merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the
Heck's investment.
    Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000
U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.
It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.
    Full-year earnings totaled 2.9 mln dlrs against a
year-earlier loss of 1.5 mln dlrs. The full-year earnings
included a 900,000 dlr net writedown of the Heck's stake, it
said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> SUES USAIR &lt;U> OVER POISON PILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed
suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its
board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"
anti-takeover plan.
    TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said
TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its
52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way
interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE>.
    Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the
enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison
pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
expensive.
    USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid
was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.
    USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the
matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no
comment on TWA's lawsuit.
    USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the
Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct
of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending
approval of a takeover.
    USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in
order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would
allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that
would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."
    USAir called on the transportation department to reject
TWA's request.

<TITLE>COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN JOSE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Costa Rica's economy minister said he
sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee
Organisation system of export quotas.
    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of
the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because
of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-
nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain
and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.
    Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight
of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export
quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.
    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota
system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once
it has satisfied internal demand.
    "There are countries such as our own whose sales
possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current
quotas," Escalante said.
    At the same time, there are countries favoured by the
current system that have been assigned quotas far above their
export potential, he said.
    The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic,"
Escalante said.
    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee
prices over the last week to speculation rather than real
matters of supply and demand.
    "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the
world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust."

<TITLE>U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. money supply growth is slowing
down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
contracted in February.
    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
Economics Inc.
    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
at the Fed," McCarthy said.
    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We
have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
coming in a lot weaker than I thought."    
    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
slowdown in the business expansion.
    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
they were a month ago," he noted.
    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd
certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."
    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all
that optimistic about the bond market."

    The rise compared to a 1.8 pct rise in January and a 2.5

    The Institute said accumulated overall inflation for the
first two months of this year was 4.0 pct compared to 5.0 pct
for the same period last year.
    Inflation for the 12 months ending February 1987 was 25.5
pct compared to 13.0 pct for the 12 months ending February
1986.

five percentage point lead over New Zealand's Labour government
in an opinion poll, reversing the seven point lead held by
Labour in a comparable poll in February.
    In the regular Television New Zealand Heylen/Eyewitness
poll, National's support rose to 50 pct against 45 pct a month
earlier while Labour's popularity dropped to 45 pct from 52
pct. National has not been ahead in this poll since April.
    This result contrasts with a newspaper poll published
yesterday that put Labour's popularity at 50 pct and National's
at 44 pct.
    Both polls showed large numbers of voters are uncommitted.
    Approval of the government's handling of the economy also
dropped in the television poll, to 34 pct from 40 pct.
    Prime Minister David Lange remained first choice as Prime
Minister but with 25 pct against 28 pct last month. Opposition
leader Jim Bolger remained steady on nine pct in this category
but his colleague and former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon rose
two points to 18 pct.
    An election is due to be held before September this year.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN FISHMEAL IMPORTS HIGHEST IN 15 YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German gross fishmeal imports rose
60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the
highest level since 1972, trade sources said.
    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net
imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.
    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a
high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The
sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.
    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West
German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -
182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.
    The two South American countries' share of the West German
market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from
Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.
    West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in
December, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with
re-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRAZIL'S FUNARO WINS FEW PROMISES ON EUROPE TRIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
last night concluded this week's tour of European capitals
having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from
governments for his country's attempts to find a radical
solution to its debt payments crisis.
    However, banking sources noted the existence of
considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its
commercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief
that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems
while patience might pave the way for an eventual
reconciliation.
    Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest
payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks,
followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and
trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions.
    The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration
in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter
of 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation.
Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week
visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government
officials and agencies.
    This week they have sought official support in the U.K.,
France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
    They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on
Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a
possible visit to Canada before they return home.
    Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to
government representatives, believing that problems with
Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution.
    However, banking sources noted that their attempts to
enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been
met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks.
    This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for
Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme,
with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also
recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.

<TITLE>RAPID-AMERICAN CORP UNIT PURSUES FRAUD SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Rapid-American Corp> said its Faberge
Inc subsidiary was granted approval by federal court to pursue
its 11 mln dlr fraud suit against &lt;Porterfield Buying Unit> and
its partners.
    Faberge said the U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York, reinstituted the suit against Porterfield and its
partners Samuel Wyman and Grace Porterfield, vacating an
earlier court decision dismissing the suit.
    The suit, filed in 1982, charges Porterfield with
overcharging commissions and for billing commericals that were
promised but never aired, according to the company. Faberge
alleges that Porterfield used fraudulent invoices and schemes
which netted it more than 3,500,000 dlrs in illegal profits.
    The suit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), was dismissed earlier because
the court ruled it did not meet certain criteria of the RICO
Act. But an Appeals Court sent the suit back to district court
based on two related decisions involving the RICO Act, Faberge
said.

<TITLE>U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Officials are studying the possible
link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the
spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a
Ministry of Agriculture official said.
    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of
salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had
been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the
Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to
investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of
salmonella.
    "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible
effects on human and animal health," the official said. The
government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm
Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves
under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would
help reduce the spread of salmonella.

<TITLE>DOME&lt;DMP> REPEATS DOME MINES&lt;DM> STAKE FOR SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake of
gold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale "at the
right price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to an
inquiry.
    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard
Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its
stake in Dome Mines.
    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy
Corp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for
Dome, and we have no intention of selling it."
    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
    He also declined to specify at what price the company would
consider selling it shares.
    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
Dome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.
    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A
price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly
attractive," Annesley said.
    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an
opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
virtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.
    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56
major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.
    The company previously said it expects to detail the plan
to lenders early next week.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> PROPOSES NEW SIMPLIFIED REGULATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it is proposing a new simplified approach to regulating
the long-distance telecommunications market.
    In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, ATT
proposed replacing the current rate of return regulation with
simplified rules that "would eliminate many costs now imposed on
customers while freeing ATT to introduce new services and
pricing options more swiftly."
    The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp said
the firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principal
long-distance competitor, ATT.
    Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would commit
to continue providing basic long-distance services to all
customers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in all
parts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to do
otherwise.
    Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the company
to file tariffs for new interstate services and price changes
that would go into effect within 14 days.
    In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of the
voluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time it
introduces or changes long-distance services.
    The new proposal would place the burden on challengers to
demonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".
    It would also require long-distance companies to submit
periodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in the
industry.
    Lawrence Garfinkel, ATT's Vice-President of Marketing
Services, said, "With this filing, we're suggesting that
regulators replace a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a
more finely tuned, targeted approach."

eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid
money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20.
    The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between
0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current
4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.
    Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11
to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.
    They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to
6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the
Bank for the previous seven-day facility.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's director-general of
finance Chris Stals said he was optimistic about reaching a
mutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors in
debt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.
    Stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "we
are busy finding out how they (banks) feel. They all have
different opinions. There is no consensus."
    But asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debt
repayment plan, Stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview from
his Pretoria office.
    He declined to comment further before the major review of
the interim debt agreement regarding the moratorium on
principal repayments on 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's 24
billion dlr external debt.
    The agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditor
banks expires on June 30. "We have had a series of discussions
with a great number of banks both bilaterally and individually
on the foreign debt situation in preparation for April," Stals
said.
    He said no date has been set for the meeting and declined
to comment on published reports in the past few months that
banks may demand accelerated repayments.
    Banking sources here said only an escalation of South
African political unrest would increase foreign pressure on
repayments.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said last month that in
the forthcoming talks South Africa would give a fair deal to
all creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands."

subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers
and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set
earlier this year.
    The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985
by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S.
subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian
production costs.
    A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of
the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months
to determine if it should be adjusted.

<TITLE>FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Kathleen Hays</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Momentum in th U.S. economy may be
picking up given solid across-the board increases in the
February U.S. employment report, economists said.
    U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,
twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a
319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously
reported 448,000 increase.
    "Even if you look at January and February together, this is
still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in
the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.
    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
previously forecast.
    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
    "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7
pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4
pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour
in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
    "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
the wage and salary disbursement," he said.
    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
    He said the February employment gains are consistent with
his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
    "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
  "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he
said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."
    "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable
goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."
    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.
    "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman
Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,
goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.
    "The employment and production data point to a big
inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."
    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
industries returning to work.
    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
in the first quarter.
    "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
that trade is improving," Benderley said.
    "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some
reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."
    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
January, previously reported at 166,000.
    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
    "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"
Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS G-6 PACT JUST A START</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is
only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic
cooperation among leading countries.
    In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker
said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and
culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."
    He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which
we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote
more balanced international growth."
    The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to
strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget
deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their
currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic
fundamentals.
    Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for
protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for
protectionism is coming from new areas of society."
    But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that
supported free trade.

<TITLE>TORONTO DOMINION TO BUY SEAT ON STOCK EXCHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> said it agreed
to acquire a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, becoming the
first Canadian bank to do so after government proposals to
allow banks full involvement in the securities industry.
    The bank, Canada's fifth largest, said one of its
subsidiaries was already a member of the Toronto Futures
Exchange and that this further step showed the bank's
commitment to active involvement in the securities industry.
    Toronto Dominion established a discount brokerage service
in 1984 called Green Line Investors Service that now serves
more investors than any other discount broker in Canada.
    The bank previously said in January that it preferred to
establish its own securities unit rather than acquire an
existing investment dealer.
    "Full TSE access will enable us to provide an even higher
level of customer service and maintain Green Line's position as
an industry leader," said Toronto Dominion president Robert
Korthals in a statement.
    He told reporters at a news conference that the bank agreed
to purchase the seat for 195,000 dlrs from Hector M. Chisholm
and Co.
    The price represents a recent high from the 166,000 dlrs
paid for a seat in 1981, but the record price remains 200,000
dlrs paid in 1929.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's director-general of
finance Chris Stals said he was optimistic about reaching a
mutually acceptable agreement with foreign bank creditors in
debt renegotiation talks scheduled to begin next month.
    Stals, the country's chief foreign debt negotiator, said "we
are busy finding out how they (banks) feel. They all have
different opinions. There is no consensus."
    But asked if he was optimistic on agreement for a new debt
repayment plan, Stals replied "yes" in a telephone interview from
his Pretoria office.
    The agreement on the moratorium with some 330 creditor
banks expires on June 30. "We have had a series of discussions
with a great number of banks both bilaterally and individually
on the foreign debt situation in preparation for April," Stals
said.
    He said no date has been set for the meeting and declined
to comment on published reports in the past few months that
banks may demand accelerated repayments.
    Banking sources here said only an escalation of South
African political unrest would increase foreign pressure on
repayments.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said last month that in
the forthcoming talks, South Africa would give a fair deal to
all creditors but not agree to "unrealistic demands."

<TITLE>BAKER SEES BRAZIL/BANKS REACHING AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said he believes Brazil will strike an agreement with its
private creditors.
    Answering questions from the National Newspaper
Association, Baker said "Brazil is not defaulting on its debt,"
and pointed out its interest payments moratorium was called
because of dwindling foreign reserves.
    He said that based on discussions with Brazilian officials
here last week, he believed Brazil's approach to its problems
was "nonconfrontational," adding, "We fully expect Brazil will
work this out with its private creditors."
    Baker pointed out Brazil was paying in full and on time its
debts to multilateral institutions, the U.S. government and
other western creditor governments.
    The country has declared an interest payments moratorium on
68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt and frozen
some 15 billion dlrs in trade and interbank deposits by
commercial bank creditors at Brazilian institutions.

<TITLE>BAKER DENIES CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY ON DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
there has been no change in U.S. policy on the value of the
dollar.
    Baker, when asked if the policy was changed in view of
comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who
said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the
dollar by 10 to 15 pct, replied, "No."
    Yesterday Robert Ortner, Undersecretary of Commerce for
Economic Affairs, said he thought the yen was undervalued but
said that was his personal view.
    This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to
conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States
and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at
about the right level to reflect underlying economic
conditions.
    Baker, who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper
Association, declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S.
policy.

<TITLE>SOME SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ON RHINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Limited shipping restrictions due to high
water remain in force on parts of the West German stretch of
the Rhine river between the Dutch border and the city of Mainz
but most are expected to be lifted this weekend.
    water authority officials said The restrictions, caused by
high water levels, include speed limits and directives to keep
to the middle of the river to prevent damage to the river
banks. The high water was expected to recede within two days to
below levels at which the restrictions come into force.
    Traffic was halted briefly late Tuesday night, Wednesday
and parts of Thursday on stretches of the Rhine between Bonn
and Koblenz but the shipping bans were lifted, the officials
said. Shipping is now permitted on all parts of the West German
section of the Rhine, with restrictions in some areas.

<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Narragansett Capital Inc &lt;NARR>
said it and Dudley S. Taft have requested a response from Taft
Broadcasting Co by March 12.
    Earlier today, Taft Broadcasting said Taft, the company's
vice chairman, and Narragansett had offered 145 dlrs for each
of Taft's 9.2 mln outstanding shares.
    The company said the offer is conditioned on approval of
its board, but a spokesman declined comment on whether or not
the board has scheduled a meeting.
     The Narragansett/Taft group will provide the equity portion
of the offer by contributing at least 125 mln dlrs in cash and
Taft Broadcasting common, Narragansett said.
    It said the group has been advised by First Boston Inc's
&lt;FBC> First Boston Corp that the investment banker is "highly
confident that financing for the acquisition can be
consummated."
    Narragansett said the offer is subject to negotiation of a
definitive merger agreement and definitive financing agreements
as well as approval by regulators, Taft's board and Taft's
stockholders.
    The Narragansett/Taft group said its letter to Taft's board
states the group intends to return control over a significant
portion of the company's equity to the Taft family while
providing other stockholders with a means of realizing a very
attractive value for their shares.

to reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the

    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce
competition.
    Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of
pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would
preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged
railroad and the public.
    If the commission agrees that public benefits and
competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the
merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file
statements in response to the supplemental petition.

<TITLE>NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group
said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
    The statement said the sale did not represent any
withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
shareholders.
    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
&lt;Industrivarden AB>.
    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
company was in a much worse state than he thought.

    The utility's BBB-minus preferred stock was affirmed. The
company has one billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    S and P cited continuing improvement in earnings protection
measures because of a 1986 emergency rate increase.
    While various writeoffs related to the abandoned Marble
Hill nuclear facility have weakened common equity, the
retention of all common earnings until at least 1989 will help
restore capital structure balance fairly quickly, S/P said.

<TITLE>GERMAN SECURITIES PURCHASES SET RECORD IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Purchases of West German bonds in
January reached a record 13 billion marks' worth as a result of
investment from other European countries amid expectations of a
European Monetary System realignment, the Bundesbank said.
    This produced a surplus in the securities item of the
long-term capital account of 11.17 billion marks and was the
primary contributor to a 10.15 billion surplus in the total
capital account, turning round December's 6.48 billion deficit.
    In January last year, the capital account, combining long
and short-term flows, showed a surplus of 2.27 billion marks,
the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank said foreign purchase of German shares in
January was, by contrast to the massive bond investments, only
about 200 mln marks worth, while overseas purchases of
"Schuldschein" promissory notes fell by 500 mln from December.
    The long-term account in total showed a surplus of 11.17
billion marks, reversing the 2.60 billion deficit in December
and up from a surplus of 9.37 billion in January, 1986.
    Among other items, direct domestic investment abroad posted
an outflow of 2.86 billion marks after a deficit of 4.98
billion in December and a surplus of 1.13 billion in January
last year.
    The Bundesbank confirmed earlier figures from the federal
statistics office that the current account surplus in January
fell to 4.86 billion marks from 8.47 billion last year.
    The trade surplus in the month was down to 7.20 billion
from 11.57 billion in December.
    In the invisibles account, the surplus on services was 100
mln marks, turning round a deficit of 500 mln marks in
December. The balance on payments transfers narrowed to a
deficit of 2.40 billion marks from 2.70 billion.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said debt
ratings on 840 mln dlrs of debt of Baker International Corp and
Hughes Tool Co remain on creditwatch.
    S and P cited the adjournment of a special shareholder
meeting in which Hughes objected to certain conditions for the
merger of the companies set by the U.S. Justice Department.
    If the merger is consumated, S and P would rate the newly
formed Baker Hughes Inc senior debt at A-minus, subordinated
debt at BBB-plus and commercial paper at A-2. But if the merger
does not occur, Baker's senior debt would be cut to A-minus
from A and commercial paper to A-2 from A-1.
    Without the merger, Hughes Tool's current ratings of B-plus
for senior debt, B-minus for subordinated debt and C for
commercial paper would be affirmed, S and P said.
    That would reflect the continuation of dismal industry
conditions and the company's substantially weaker credit
profile, S and P explained.

said it and police authorities are investigating a possible
embezzlement by a bonded former employee that may involve
several hundred thousand dollars.
    The company said it does not expect the possible
embezzlement to materially affect 1986 earnings. It said the
release of results will be delayed for about a week by the
investigation.
    Crosby said the amount may be covered by a fidelity bond

the money.

<TITLE>GENENTECH &lt;GENE> FILES SUIT AGAINST FDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Genentech Inc said it filed
a suit against the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia over an unresolved
issue relating to genetically engineered human growth hormone.
    At issue, said Genentech, is whether Eli Lilly and Co's
&lt;ELI> recombinant human growth hormone and its new recombinant
growth hormone, are the same drug. Both drugs are under review
by the FDA.
    Since 1985, Genentech has been marketing Protropin, a
recombinant human growth hormone for treating abnormally short
children.
    The biotechnology concern said it has the right to seven
years of exclusive marketing for Protropin, granted orphan drug
status by the FDA. Orphan drugs are a special category of drugs
that are used to treat rare diseases.
    Genentech said the suit seeks clarification of what
constitutes a drug under the standards of the orphan Drug Act.
It suggested that without the "clarification," companies that
develop orphan drugs may not recover development costs during
the period of marketing exclusivity.
    It said Lilly's growth hormone and its new growth hormone
differ slightly, and are produced by different processes.

of the state's rights to a 2.5 billion franc one-for-five

    The price was based on a 12 billion franc minimum value set
on Rhone-Poulenc by the independent Privatisation Committee
established by the government to oversee its five-year
privatisation programme, the Ministry said.
    A Ministry statement said eight mln privileged investment
certificates, a form of non-voting preference share, would be
issued, equivalent to one certificate for every five existing
shares.
    It said 10 pct of the certificates would be reserved for
Rhone-Poulenc employees at a preferential price, and 1.5 mln
certificates would be placed on the U.S. Market by a public
offering.
    About four mln certificates, the remainder of the state's
rights entitlement to the issue, would be offered on the Paris
Bourse on the basis of 20 francs per lot of five rights and 315
francs per new certificate, making a total 335 francs, it said.
    Rhone-Poulenc is 88.39 pct state-owned.

barge traffic up to the Twin Cities in Minnesota after repairs
were completed and the first barges moved upstream through Lock
and Dam 20 near Quincy, Ill at 0600 CST today, an Army Corps of
Engineers spokesman said.
    About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locks
three and four on the upper Mississippi River, but other
sections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said.
    Midwestern weather has been so mild that barges probably
could have kept loading at Mid-Mississippi River terminals
through the winter, if Lock and Dam 20 had not been scheduled
for repairs, he said.
    The Peoria and La Grange locks on the Illinois River are
still scheduled to close July 13, for two months of repairs.

the product of 1.8 times LIBOR from 21.975.
    The Residential CMO package also has three fixed-rate

    Yields on these securities, to be fully paid by dates from

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Duff and Phelps said it has downgraded
fixed income securities of USX Corp and its subsidiaries and at
the same time took the issues off its watch list.
    The change affects about 6.6 billion dlrs in debt
securities.
    USX senior debt was lowered to DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9
middle BBB), Marathon oil senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9,
United States Steel senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9 and
subordinated debt to DP-13 (low BB) from DP-11, USX preferred
stock to DP-14 (high B) from DP-12 (middle BB) and preference
stock to DP-15 (middle B) from DP-13.
    The downgrades reflect substantial business risk and
increased financial risk, Duff and Phelps said.
    The steel industry remains intensely competitive and major
domestic integrated producers have lost share to imports and
minimills, D and P said. In oil and gas, profitability and cash
flows are larger, but there is still considerable volatility.
As for financial risk, USX has arranged to borrow 1 billion
dlrs through a production payment of its Marathon subsidiary.
Consequently a selected group of creditors has prior claim to
public debt holders for cash flows from this asset, D and P
said.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador today suspended its crude oil
exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that
damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy
and Mines MInistry statement said.
    It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera
Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was
declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor.
    Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day
(bpd).
    A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping
station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.
    He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached
to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed.
    The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador
volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean
seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international
Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the
volcano, he said.
    The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia,
according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.

downgraded 50 mln dlrs of debt of Allied Bancshares Inc and the
lead bank, Allied Bank of Texas.
    Cut were the parent's senior debt to Ba-3 from Baa-2 and
commercial paper to Not Prime from Prime-2. The lead bank's
long-term deposits were reduced to Ba-1 from Baa-2 and
short-term deposits were cut to Not Prime from Prime-2.
    Moody's cited the effects of a weak operating environment
on Allied's asset quality and profitability. The rating agency
expects nonperforming loans to remain high by industry
standards because of exposure to energy and real estate.

<DATELINE>    COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co>
said its property-casualty companies had a net loss of 56 mln
dlrs last year while its life insurance operations earned 66.8
mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said its property-casualty group, the
fourth-largest U.S. property-casualty insurer had a 106 mln dlr
loss in 1986. Nationwide Life Insurance Co earned 62.8 mln dlrs
in 1985, with last year's profit including record capital gains
of 14.4 mln dlrs, up from gains of 2.6 mln dlrs the previous
year.
    The company said its property-casualty group had a record
loss from insurance operations last year of 859 mln dlrs after
policyholders' dividends, up 25 pct from 1985's 710 mln dlrs.
    Nationwide said a surge in claims from personal auto
insurance and the volatile commercial liability coverages
during a period of unprecedented sales growth generated the
loss.
    The company said over 576 mln dlrs of last year's group
losses came from commercial insurance lines and 282 mln dlrs
from its personal auto insurance business.
    Partially offsetting 1986's record insurance losses,
Nationwide said, were record investment gains of 775 mln dlrs
and a 28 mln dlr federal tax credit. The investment gains were
up 39 pct from 1985's gains of 559 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pierre Suchet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French primary bond market is showing
signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
week, dealers noted.
    The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the
money markets since December has been based on a floor and
ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
seven day repurchase rates.
    For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate
cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
absorbed.
    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
focussed on the likely three next issues.
    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
Refinancement Hypothecaire.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reuters Holdings PLC's Reuters
Information Services Inc subsidiary and Real Estate Financing
Partnership of Philadelphia said they have developed RSVP, an
electronic market access system for commercial property
financing.
    The companies said the system, on completion of testing,
will use the Reuter communications network to provide a
confidential method for the purchasing, selling and financing
of commercial property. They said principal participants in
RSVP are expected to be private and institutional commercial
real estate owners, brokers, purchasers and investors.
    The companies said the system, which will operate in
domestic and international markets, is expected to be
particularly useful to mortgage brokers and loan
correspondents.
    They said Reuters will provide systems software, hardware
and telecommunications capabilities and support under a
long-term working agreement with Real Estate Financing
Partnership and will also provide sales assistance and
marketing support to Real Estate Financing.
    Real Estate Financing designed RSVP.
    The companies said RSVP will use Reuter Monitor technology
and the Reuter private communications network to provide a
global financing capability for commercial real estate
ventures. It will enable parties seeking real estate financing
to identify funding sources on a private basis.
    They said the system is scheduled for testing in August in
selected U.S. cities and is expected to be operational about 90
days after initial testing.

<TITLE>IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian government, which
introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,
has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is
scope for further cuts in 1988.
    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions
of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic
policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the
weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.
    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest
rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.
    The team's report to the government praises last year's
spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending
by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy
perform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in
the 1980s."
    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation
of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much
lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the
government has set itself for 1989.
    The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of
GNP in 1986.
    The report says "The most that can be afforded over the next
few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of
general Government."
    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax
system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax
burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the
debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.
    "Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure
growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,
we feel that your position would be stronger if you could
decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," the
report adds.
    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the
government's determination to keep its currency strong and to
curb inflation.
    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net
long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.
    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and
an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the
subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in
Belgian francs.

unit of NEC Corp &lt;NIPNY> said a U.S. District Court judge
denied NEC's motion to disqualify Judge William Ingram from
presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp &lt;INTC>.
    NEC said it sought to disqualify the judge when it learned
in October 1986 that Ingram had an ownership interest in an
investment club that owned Intel stock.
    Ingram reported that his interest in Intel through the club
amounted to about 80 dlrs worth of Intel's stock and the judge
ended his participation in the investment club after NEC moved
to have him disqualified, an NEC spokeswoman said.
    NEC said it intends to appeal the ruling.
    NEC sued Intel in December 1984 seeking a judgement
declaring that microcode, or the control function, in certain
NEC microprocessor products does not infringe on any valid
Intel copyrights.
    Intel subsequently filed a suit charging NEC with
infringing on Intel semiconductor copyrights.

<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>This week's Bank of England resistance to
strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
said.
    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action
over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
distance of that range," he said.
    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
broad target range around this area.
    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
    "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
foreign exchange market.
    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
holds around these levels.
    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they
ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.
    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being
invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
notice.
    However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
    "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,
economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
sterling, at least in the near term.
    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
about March 17, Budget Day.
    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
Budget, said Temperton.
    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
    "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
equities arm of Mercury International Group.
    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is "very disappointed" by a Canadian government
finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.
    "This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing
U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of
multilateral trade negotiations," Lyng said in a statement.
    The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to
apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.
    Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are
not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding
that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.
    "Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that
Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising
faster than consumption," Lyng said.

<TITLE>GATT STUDYING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES CEILING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world trade body GATT said its
negotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a
ceiling on agricultural subsidies.
    GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told
reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the
participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the
table.
    He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied
to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
with high subsidy spending.
    Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western
industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a
total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from
1979-81.
    Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24
billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.
    Yves Berthelot, an official for the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, said the suppression of
agricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which would
allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic
prices, would be difficult but inevitable.

<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> OFFICIALS HAWKING STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Outboard Marine Corp's top executives
are making sales presentations to portfolio managers and
analysts ahead of a planned two mln share offering expected
soon, company officials said.
    Chairman Charles Strang and Wayne Jones, vice president for
strategic planning, are meeting with portfolio managers in New
York and Boston to line up interest for the offering
underwritten solely by Morgan Stanley, the officials said.
    Outboard Marine has been the subject of recurring takeover
rumors, with one rumor this week naming Sun Chemical as the
potential suitor for 40 dlrs a share.
    Sun Chemical is said to have 4.9 pct of Outboard and is
conducting a study on whether to bid for control of the marine
engine and boatbuilding company. A Sun Chemical spokesman
declined to comment.
    Stanley Fishman, analyst at Fahnestock and Co, said it is
better for a suitor to bid for Outboard before the two mln
shares are sold. Outboard now has 17 mln shares outstanding.
    "Even though Outboard would use proceeds from the share
offering to pay down debt, and there would be less debt the
acquiring company would assume, it still means more shares the
suitor must buy to acquire the company," he said.
    Fishman, who has heard the Sun Chemical rumor, said a 40
dlrs a share would just open the bidding.
    Outboard Marine today was trading at 33-5/8, down 5/8.
    "There are only two companies that count in the marine
leisure business, Brunswick Corp &lt;BC> being the first. But you
can't play down number two," He said. "It's a growing field.
There's a lot of leisure money out there. I think 40 would be a
minimum price. It will be higher."
    A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the offering has been
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission but a
kick-off date and price have not been set.

<TITLE>BANKERS PREDICT SHAKEOUT IN SWEDISH BANKING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The central bank recommended a major
change in the traditional ownership structure of Swedish
commercial banks that bankers said would inevitably lead to the
takeover of remaining small regional banks.
    The recommendation was prompted by a recent proposal by the
&lt;Proventus> financial group to create a new holding company
that will control the third-largest commercial bank &lt;Gotabanken
and Wermlandsbanken>, a small regional bank.
    The central bank gave its approval and said financial
groups should be allowed to have banking subsidiaries as long
as the groups did not include industrial or trading companies.
    The central bank was commenting on a proposed new bill
governing Swedish financial groups.
    It recommended that insurance companies should not be
allowed to own banks until a separate inquiry into the problem
was completed. Sweden's two biggest insurance companies have
both said they would like to enter the banking business.
    Sweden's commercial banks on the other hand have long
wanted to buy up insurance companies.
    Bankers said the recommendations would mainly bring the
rules up to date with new circumstances created by the
extensive de-regulation of the Swedish financial markets since
1982.
    Bankers said it was clear that others would follow the
Proventus example and that this would lead to a shake-up in the
banking system with the remaining small regional banks being
absorbed by larger banking groups.
    The central bank also recommended banks be allowed to
operate their stockbroking departments as subsidiaries, which
bankers said would lead to banks taking over small stockbroking
firms. Banks have long complained the ban on splitting off the
broking departments forced them to operate at a disadvantage
because they could not match the partnerships and large
salaries stockbrokers could offer their staff.

Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).
    In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG
stated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.
    "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet
EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet
purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to
purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.
    "Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.
eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure
mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain
agreement," the letter said.

<TITLE>ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS>
chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase
in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was
encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.
    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release
of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign
earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,
notably in the securities business.
    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10
share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.
    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share
price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.
    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the
future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and
ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.
    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986
by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1
pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.
    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings
margins via traditional lending activities, he said.
    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk
provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly
concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor
which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank
stocks recently.
    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially
troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin
American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.
    He added that losses incurred through loans to tin
producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had
been written off.

<TITLE>ROCHESTER GAS &lt;RGS> SEES FURTHER NUCLEAR DELAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rochester Gas and Electric Co
said it now estimates Unit Two of the Nine Mile nuclear power
plant will not start commercial operation until 1988's first
quarter.
    The utility said this estimate is based on the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's advisory to the plant's operator,
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp &lt;NMK>, a more through demonstration
of the main steam isolation valve's acceptablility will be
needed before the plant's power ascension program can proceed.
    Rochester Gas disclosed the further delay in the operation
of Nine Mile Unit Two in the preliminary prospectus describing
its proposed offering of 300,000 preferred shares, par value
100 dlrs.
    A spokesman said Niagara Mohawk had been projecting
commercial operation of the plant in September, adding this
projection was scheduled for review upon completion of the main
steam isolation valve testing program which company officials
still expect next week.
    In the past, Niagara Mohawk has put the cost of delays in
Nine Mile Unit Two at two mln dlrs per day.
    Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in the nuclear power
plant, while Rochester Gas owns 14 pct.
    In a statement released today, Rochester Gas said the NRC,
based on progress of the valve testing program, had advised
Niagra Mohawk a more through demonstration of the acceptability
of the valve's and their ability to meet regulations and
technical specifications will be required before the power
ascension program can proceed.
    The Niagara Mohawk spokesman said the utility would have
not immediate response to the Rochester Gas statement.

<TITLE>FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AID TO JOBLESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government plans to go ahead with a
three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed,
with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to
everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.
    At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln
jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive
unemployment benefit.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television
interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in
a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the
right to social benefits."
    The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment
through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5
billion franc government fund set up last month to finance
spending on special areas of concern.
    Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers
hit by European Community cost-cutting measures.
    French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8
mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in
1981.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration continues
to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they
would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a
senior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.
    "I think it still is under active debate whether or not it
would be advisable" to make an the export enhancement offer to
the Soviets, Thomas Kay, administrator of the department's
Foreign Agriculture Service, told Reuters.
    "We'd need some assurances from them (the Soviets) that they
would buy if offered" the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said.
Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent "premature."
    The Reagan administration's cabinet-level Economic Policy
Council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters,
agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials
said earlier.

<TITLE>CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. corn
imports injure Canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."
    "U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is
inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any
reasonable measure," Yeutter said in a statement.
    He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could
result in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout the
world." French corn growers have recently indicated they will
challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.
    Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision
closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on
facts, "will carefully evaluate appropriate responses." Yeutter
did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.

lead-manager Lazard Freres et Cie said.
    The issue will be priced at par with a one pct coupon, and
each 10,000 franc bond will carry 18 warrants, each giving the
right to subscribe to Moet-Hennessy shares over a three-year
period at 2,720 francs each. The high equity content of the
issue accounts for the low coupon.
    Moet-Hennessy shares closed on the Paris Bourse today at
2,678 francs, up 38 from yesterday's close.
    The issue is being co-lead managed by Credit Lyonnais,
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Credit Suisse First Boston.

<TITLE>S/P SAYS CORPORATE DOWNGRADES MAY EASE THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year
from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.
    However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay
at about the same level as in the past few years.
    The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades
would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile
energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and P
said.
    In particular, S and P expects that the industrial and
banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.
    S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were
concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative
factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and
acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.
    It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.
    While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilized
after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not
mark a turnaround for this industry.
    In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hit
the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of
1986's unexpected LTV Corp &lt;LTV> bankruptcy filing.
    Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall
1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. But
like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P
said.
    The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to
outpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's
rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio
of downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.
    S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry
would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. A
detailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek.

<TITLE>CONTRA LEADER LINKS MYSTERY DLRS TO ARMS SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero
has for the first time linked payments received for his forces
to a dummy company controlled by former White House aide Oliver
North, legal sources said.
    The company, Lake Resources Inc, was established by North
and his ally, retired Air Force major General Richard Secord,
and had a Swiss bank account into which proceeds from secret
arms sales to Iran were deposited.
    Calero yesterday made public bank statements showing his
group has received 32 mln dlrs since mid-1984, but said he has
no idea who donated the money.
    Calero, head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, known by
its Spanish initials as FDN, provided the same records to a
grand jury investigating the Iran arms scandal that has shaken
the Reagan administration.
    The bank statements he showed reporters ended with March,
1985, so they shed no light on whether Iran arms profits were
diverted to contra rebels since shipments of U.S. arms to Iran
did not begin until September 1985.
    But last night, Calero told Cable News Network that he had
just discovered deposits made in late October, 1985 by Lake
Resources into a contra account in the Cayman Islands.
   
    This came at a time when proceeds from the Iran arms sales
were being funneled to the Swiss bank account.
    "I just found out," he said.
    Legal sources confirmed that Calero had turned over the
newly disclosed information, which was brought to his attention
after one of his lawyers noticed the two desposits made by Lake
Resources buried in the mass of bank records.
    They said that Calero has promised to review in more detail
the bank statements and pass along any further information on
possible deposits by the North-Secord groups.
    The Tower commission said in its report that up to 19.8 mln
dlrs from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran was unaccounted for
and may have been diverted to the contras.
    Calero's FDN is the largest of the contra rebel groups
that are fighting to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
    On the advice of his lawyer, Calero declined to go into
details about what he told the grand jury.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>India has called a fresh buying tender
for up to four 13,000 tonne cargoes of white sugar on March 11,
traders here said.
    The tender calls for one cargo of prompt sugar and two to
three with March/April shipment sugar, or the same as the eight
cargoes bought at a tender two days ago. That tender originally
only sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of
eight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twice
that amount at the same price but for April/May shipment.
    Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely for
India again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70
pct-owned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture has been granted an
additional concession of land in Ghana to look for and mine
gold.
    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an
additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,
contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier, the
company said.
    The original concession appears to have a substantial
amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or
6/100 ounces, of gold per metric ton.
    But the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of
extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the
reserves can be mined profitably, the company said.
    It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the
newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in
geological characteristics to the original land.

<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world's major copper producing and
consuming countries have reached "a degree of consensus" on
objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at
reviewing the world copper market, officials said.
    Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed
forum for copper have recommended that another session be held
in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a
spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said.
    The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to
examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    Its objectives would include increasing market
transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking
activities aimed at developing the copper market and
contributing to improvement of demand.
    UNCTAD's spokesman said, "Once they have agreed on detailed
functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to
setting up the body."

<TITLE>CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question," McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
    "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
it to be there," McKinley said.
    International oil traders said that other short-haul
crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
managers at several companies told Reuters.
    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
Management, said OPEC production was lower "because of the
Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."
     He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.
    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
    "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
being resold," one international trader said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/ PAPER STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Patrick Rizzo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The attempt by International Paper Co
&lt;IP> and Stone Container Co &lt;STO> to raise linerboard prices
could stick, industry analysts said, citing strong demand and
tight capacity. But they said rising inventories hurt the odds.
    "It remains to be seen whether the increases will be
accepted, but I think the odds are better than 50-50 they
will," Mark Rogers, paper analyst for Prudential Bache said.
    Mead Corp &lt;ME> and Union Camp Corp &lt;UCC> said they are also
considering price increases.
    Rogers, who has been aggressively recommending Stone and
International Paper for several months, said the increases
could stick because plants are running full tilt and little new
capacity is coming on stream.
    "The operating rates in linerboard are running at about 97
to 98 pct of capacity, but demand continues to climb," Gene
Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Camp
said "The industry is essentially sold out."
    Cartledge said domestic linerboard shipments in January hit
about 1.6 mln tons, six pct higher than January 1986, while
exports hit 170,000 tons, three to four pct higher.
    Nevertheless, rising inventories could nip the increase in
the bud, Lawrence Ross, forest products analyst for Paine
Webber, said.
    "Containerboard inventories have been growing for the past
three months," Ross said. "Over that time inventories rose from
4.8 weeks worth of supplies to 5.9 weeks most recently."
    Also, Ross said that the Jacksonville, Fla., paper mill, 49
pct owned by Stone, is planning to come on stream again soon,
which may help alleviate some of the supply constraints. "The
plant's capacity, by itself, is about two pct of the industry
total," Ross said.
    But, Rogers said the Jacksonville mill "won't be enough" to
significantly ease tight capacity this year. The price increase
is necessary, he said, to attract more investment.
    Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recent
years to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, adding
that he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range this
year.
    "The consensus on the Street is changing," he said, "from
whether there will be increases to when is the next increase
and how much."

<TITLE>MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)
will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn
syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.
    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange
expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has
been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in
December, 1985.
    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of
55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank
truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet
milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most
commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other
beverages.
    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production
facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated
by the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months
traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of
March, May, July, September and December.
    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a
minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation
of one dlr per CWT.
    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will be
actively involved, those producers being the large processors,
the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage
bottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for all
types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries
that utilize fructose."

<TITLE>SIEMENS WANTS TO AMEND TELECOM PLUS &lt;TELE> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Telecom Plus International Inc
said &lt;Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend
its agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus
Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.
    Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln
dlr transaction Monday.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
and warranties are true.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
    Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.
    A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of
all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
on the anniversary date of the transaction.
    He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added
to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.
    Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit
Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of
certain intercompany debt until completion of the review.
Telecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs.

additional concession of land in Ghana to seek and mine gold.
    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an
additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,
contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier.
    The original concession appears to have a substantial
amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or
6/100 ounces, of gold per tonne. But the venture has no firm
estimate on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances
can be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the
company said. It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted
tests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be
similar in geological characteristics to the original land.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A counter-proposal from creditor
banks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion
dlr foreign debt was faulty, an Argentine observer at
negotiations said.
    "The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor
banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as
it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy
Raul Baglini said.
    Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the
steering committee for Argentina's creditor banks in New York,
spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.
    Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account
Argentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four
pct growth targets in 1987.
    He said the steering committee wanted only to discuss some
aspects of the request, while Argentina's negotiators were
laying emphasis on a global pacakge.
    The United States said last week it would back a 500 mln
dlr bridge loan to Argentina.

<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Dilson Funaro,
currently on a global tour to seek governmental support for his
efforts to solve Brazil's 108 billion dlrs foreign debt crisis,
said creditors have expressed willingness to help.
    In an interview with the Globo television network,
transmitted from Rome, Funaro said he had proposed a "four-year
plan" to the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the
commitments derived from its debt.
    After visiting the U.S., England, France, West Germany,
Italy and Switzerland, Funaro is now on his way to Tokyo, where
he is to arrive on Sunday for talks with Japanese government
officials as well as private bankers.

<TITLE>LUCKY STORES &lt;LKS>, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, Calif., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lucky Stores Inc said it and
investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
restructuring plan.
    Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed
to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of
out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other
costs.
    "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders
by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and
the accompanying demands on management time," Lucky Stores
chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
should help the company's profits, analysts said.
    "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
volume users, but status quo for residential users," said
PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
constrained the company's profits in the long distance
business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
    Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
its competitors to oppose it filings.
    MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing
yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
in the telephone business.
    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
industry giant faces.
    "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"
said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't
see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "It
will give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.
    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
hearings.
    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United
Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.
    "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S.
Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
to greater competition.
    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
and in the process they may be altered by the various
constituencies affected by the move.
    "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
won't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of the
Gartner Group.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Navy last month grounded half of
its A-6E attack jets for wing inspections after a California
accident but has since returned half of the grounded planes to
service, a Navy spokesman said.
    Kevin Mukri said 186 of the Navy's 340 A-6E aircraft, built
by Grumman Corp, were grounded on Feb. 20 after a Jan. 14 A-6E
crash during a training flight near El Centro, Calif., which
killed one of two crewmen aboard.
    "A subsequent inspection of the wreckage at the Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington showed an apparent inner wing
stress problem," Mukri told Reuters.
    "Ninety-seven of the grounded planes have since undergone
visual inspections and 91 of those have been cleared to return
to service," he said.

<TITLE>IRAN INVESTIGATORS SEEK REAGAN TAPES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House and Senate committees
investigating the Iran arms scandal said they would like to
review tapes of phone conversations between President Reagan
and White House officials, if such tapes exist.
    The committees were responding to a magazine article
that quoted unidentified "sources with first-hand knowledge of
U.S. communications intelligence" as saying there is an archive
of recorded conversations among Reagan administration
officials, including the president.
    The article in Progressive magazine also said the
government had secretly monitored the home telephone of former
National Security adviser Robert McFarlane after he had left
government service in late 1985.
    "According to sources with first hand knowledge of U.S.
communications intelligence operations," the story said, "the
McFarlane intercept grew out of a program that has produced a
still-undisclosed archive of recorded conversations involving
... Reagan, Vice President George Bush, (fired National
Security Council aide) Lt Col Oliver North, (former National
Security Adviser) Adm John Poindexter, (former White House
Chief of Staff) Donald Regan and other key figures in the
Iran-contra arms scandal."
    It said the monitoring was done for security and record
purposes by the top-secret National Security Agency (NSA), and
was apparently done with the consent of those monitored.
    But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied one
premise of the article, saying, "The National Security Agency
said it did not monitor any of McFarlane's conversations."
    He did not comment on the other recorded conversations the
Progressive article said were included in the program.
    "Clearly we would be interested in taking a look if indeed
such tapes exist," a Senate Iran committee aide told Reuters in
response to the magazine article.
    A spokesman for the House Iran committee said the panel
would consider a request to the NSA for copies of the
telephone-tap archive described in the article.
    Several legislators said the tapes, if it is confirmed that
they exist, could prove invaluable to the special House and
Senate committees that were created in January to investigate
Reagan's most damaging political crisis.
    "This sort of evidence could be absolutely crucial in
getting to the bottom of the affair," said Rep. Robert
Kastenmeier, a Wisconsin Democrat and member of the House
Intelligence Committee, told Reuters.

to report a loss, without tax benefit, of about 16 mln dlrs for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1986, versus a profit of
295,000 dlrs in fiscal 1985.
    The company added, however, that about 13.6 mln dlrs of the
loss relates to discontinued operations and disposal of
subsidiaries.
    The company said the loss is part of its previously
announced restructuring that includes the sale of its foreign
and domestic units.
    Struthers added that it has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an extension to file its annual report
on form 10-K as a result of delays caused by the restructuring.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> CONFIRMS OWNERSHIP OF USAIR &lt;U> STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it owns
more than four mln USAir Group shares or about 15 pct of the
total outstanding.
    TWA said it may acquire additional shares in the open
market, in private transactions, through a tender offer or
otherwise, subject to Department of Transportation approval.
    TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir
rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last-minute attempt
to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application
for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of
Transportation, and later today it will file a response to
USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.
    TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position
in USAir in response to inquiries.
    Traders said they believed TWA Chairman Carl Icahn was the
buyer of an 855,000 share block crossed today by Salomon
Brothers.
    USAir stock was trading at 50-3/4, up 2-1/4 on heavy volume
of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3/8 to 30-5/8.
    While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn
may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the
acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take
Icahn's effort more seriously.
    "I think he's going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall
Street," said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern
Airlines and People Express Airlines.
    There was also speculation that Icahn would like to buy
USAir and then sell TWA as a merged company.

<TITLE>GROUP TO BOOST FAIRCHILD INDUSTRIES (FEN) STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>An investor group led by New York
investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild
Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its
holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation
company's outstanding stock.
    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries
shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
total outstanding stock.
    The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe
management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
shareholder values."
    It said it was considering the additional share purchases
to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the
future management and policies of the issuer."
    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
management policies, available financial resources and other
factors.
    The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other
measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.
    The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore
investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
that is advised by Soros.
    The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,
it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold
6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.
    A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told
the company he was not dissatisfied with its management.
    "Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the company
today that he is not dissatisfied with management," Fairchild's
Bill Fulwider told Reuters.
    However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to
say at this time about Soros' disclosure that he may buy up
enough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pct
of the company's outstanding stock.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Payless Cashways Inc chairman David
Stanley told analysts the company's first quarter results to be
reported March 17 will be better than the seven cts per share
reported in the year ago quarter.
    "It was not a wonderful sales quarter, but it only
represents 14 pct of the year's total results," Stanley said.
    Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be in
excess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrs
reported in 1986. He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55
dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."
    Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.
    "The economy may not get a lot better, but we expect our
advantages in the lumber industry and cost cutting measures to
keep us competitive," Larry Kunz, chief financial officer,
said.
     The company acquired Knox Lumber Co for about 24.3 mln
dlrs in October 1986.
    Stanley said the company's stronger-than-optimal balance
sheet will enable it to make further acquisitions but no
negotiations are going on at the current time.
    He said some benefits of a new management information
system will be felt in 1987 and more substantially in 1988.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER URGES OVERHAUL OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert
Heller said the U.S. legal and regulatory framework of the U.S
financial system needs a complete overhaul so American banks
can be more competitive in international markets.
    "It has become abundantly clear that our financial system
must be overhauled to bring it up to the standard that will be
required if we are to remain the leading financial power of the
world in the coming years," Heller said in a speech prepared for
delivery to a financial services industry conference.
    Heller said a patchwork approach to changing the nation's
banking and financial services laws will not work.
    "Instead, a comprehensive overhaul of the entire financial
system is called for," he said.
    Heller said he was encouraged that Congress would take a
comprehensive look at reforming the nation's banking laws after
they enact legislation now pending that would recapitalize the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal
regulators more power to deal with failing banks.
    Heller said he liked the concept of the financial services
holding company, which would allow a bank to exist side by side
with other financial services companies. He said that would end
the debate on securities powers for banks.
    "The holding company may own both a securities house and a
bank, so that both services may be provided to the same
customer, subject to safeguards against conflicts of interest,"
he said.
    Such an institution be in a better position to compete in
the financial services markets around the globe, he said.
    Heller said he expects world trade to expand more rapidly
that domestic production and that traditional trade finance
should grow with it.
    "It may be time to dust off the old letters of credit and to
prepare for an increase in traditional export financing
opportunities," Heller said.
    But he warned that protectionist sentiments could "kill the
golden goose that is about to provide new profit opportunities
for international traders and bankers alike that will benefit
consumers by providing them with cheaper goods."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Oil Corp said it is reorganizing
its U.S. exploration and producing operations into a single
affiliate, Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. Inc, to be
headquartered in Dallas, effective April one.
    The Mobil Corp subsidiary said the operations are presently
run from three affiliates located in Denver, New Orleans and
Houston.
    It said about 300 employees will be relocated to Dallas,
adding these will be primarily in management, administrative
and staff functions.
    Mobil Oil said most technical and field operating people
will remain at their current locations but some staff functions
will be reduced.
    Spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the
impact of any reductions.
    The company said the new affiliate will comprise four
producing divisions and six exploration divisions. Four of the
exploration divisions will be located with producing divisions
in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, and Midland, Texas. The
remaining two will be in Oklahoma City and Bakersfield, Calif.
    Mobil Oil said the reorganization will "enhance our
profitability" by emphasizing technology and improved
communications, adding it will be able to respond quickly to
changes in business environment.
    The company said C.E. Spruell, now vice president,
international producing operations, has been appointed
president and general manager of the new affiliate.

banks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion

    "The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor
banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as
it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy
Raul Baglini said.
    Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the

spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.
    Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government's move to pare its huge
financing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more
room for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for
treasury bills, senior market analysts said.
    The Bank of Canada, Ottawa's fiscal agent in the
marketplace, revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing
needs has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and
heavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction, issued in
terms of up to one year.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," the Bank of Canada said in its 1986
annual report released this week.
    The government has said its budget deficit financing
requirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1987, from 30 billion dlrs the prior year.
Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 21.3 billion dlrs.
    The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond
issues, nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10
years. Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new
issues with terms in the two- to five-year range.
    Meanwhile, treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled
nearly 70 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over
the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    Although the amount of money saved from moving away from
the long bonds was not disclosed, bond experts believe it was
considerable because of the much lower interest premiums paid
on short term debt.
    But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will
have on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian
bonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference
for long term financings.
    Bond traders said the Japanese, who purchased a record 9.5
billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to the
changes by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to
the medium term issues offered by Ottawa.
    "Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six
months has been very much concentrated in the medium term
maturities," noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be
identified.
    Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually
develop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years.
    Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc, "When interest rates finally seem to have stopped
going down, there is going to be a flood of people trying to
lock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in
the door."
    But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates
trending down, investors appear to welcome the change,
especially the greater treasury bill financing.
    "The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,"
said Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm,
Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd.
    The change also improves receptivity in the market for
other borrowers, including provincial governments, the big
utilities and corporations.
    "There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end
now, that also may be the result that any percieved shortage
has probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,"
commented Berry.

<TITLE>BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strikes by Brazil's 40,000
seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing
major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt
crisis.
    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25
years and union leaders say they have seriously affected
Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.
    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest
payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp
deterioration in its trade balance.
    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most
petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for
higher fuel prices.
    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages
could lead to a serious fuel shortage.
    The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the
72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.
    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today
entitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economic
point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,
with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the
country's external trade."
    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected
offers of up to 100 pct.
    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due
to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior
official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao
Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless
of the tribunal's ruling.
    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse
over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price
freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not
only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station
owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao
Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.
    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of
Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for
exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.
    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their
profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six
U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).
    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last
night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still
could.
    Political sources said the government of President Jose
Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel
supply situation.

<TITLE>DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale "at
the right price."
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years," he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very
attractive."

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES JAPAN OPEN MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The director of the Treasury
Department's office of international banking and portfolio
investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to
more U.S. firms.
    "The Treasury would like to see greater openness of
Jaspanese markets, including more U.S. firms admitted to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and an increased role for U.S. financial
firms in the Japanese Government bond market," Ammerman said in
a prepared speech for a conference on financial services
sponsored by Georgetown University.
    Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes "any
discrimination against U.S. banks wishing to set up in the
securities business in Japan in their own name will be
eliminated promptly."
    He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop
giving favored treatment to domestic banks over U.S.
competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives.
    He said the United States will "press vigorously for
liberalization" of financial services in all foreign markets. If
negotiations fail, "We will not hesitate to take vigorous
actions to promote or protect our interests," he added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Defense Department official
said he believed President Reagan has decided against an early
deployment of the controversial anti-missile defense system
known as "Star Wars."
    But the official, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard
Perle, told a luncheon Reagan could decide within a few weeks
to adopt a less restrictive interpretation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to justify a move towards
wider "Star Wars" testing and development.
    "I think the president has made a decision not to proceed
with an early deployment of SDI," said Perle, referring to the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as Reagan's anti-missile project
is formally called.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS CREDITORS WILLING TO HELP BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Dilson Funaro,
currently on an international tour to seek governmental support
for his efforts to solve Brazil's 108-billion-dlr foreign debt
crisis, said creditors have expressed willingness to help.
    In an interview with the Globo television network,
transmitted from Rome, Funaro said the reception by
representatives of creditor countries with whom he met along
the week was always to seek new ways.
    "Brazil made several adjustments in its economy in the past
which affected the goodwill of its people. We now wish to keep
the country's growth in order to be able to face the problems
of the future," Funaro said.
    The minister said that he had proposed a "four-year plan" to
the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the
commitments derived from its debt.
    "We cannot continue negotiating every year with our
creditors, having to face difficulties in the meantime, not
knowing whether a new package will or will not be approved, as
it is happening to other debtor countries," the minister said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Feedgrains Council is
surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's
decision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially
injuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.
    "At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade
in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is
incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much
from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would
threaten that process by caving in to pressures for
protectionism," council president Darwin E. Stolte said.
    Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading
relationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains 
support for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively
impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Department animal
health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird
markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an
infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.
    The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird
markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once
the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to
determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza
viruses, it said.
    In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to
control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,
it said.
    The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.

<TITLE>HOLIDAY &lt;HIA> UNIT'S NOTES DOWNGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it cut to
B from B-plus 900 mln dlrs of notes due 1994 of Holiday Inns
Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp.
    S and P said the action reflected a change in the issue's
terms to unsecured from secured. That change was made after S
and P's initial rating release on February 20, it noted.
    After the firm's recapitalization, substantially all of its
assets will be pledged to secure bank and other debt totaling
1.4 billion dlrs. S and P said it is making a rating
distinction between secured and unsecured debt because of the
significant amount of secured in Holiday's capital structure.
    However, S and P said that if the amount of secured debt
decreases meaningfully, then the secured and unsecured debt
could be rated equally.
    The 900 mln dlrs of seven-year notes were priced late
yesterday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The notes
were given a 10-1/2 pct coupon and par pricing.
    Holiday Inns also sold yesterday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of
subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par
pricing. This issue was rated B-minus by S and P.
    Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc said its initial
rating of B-1 for the notes remained appropriate.

<TITLE>U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Advocates of a 0/92 plan for
feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
sources said.
    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
be treated equally, they said.
   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
offer their proposals next week, sources said.
   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
bill, but to be fair to all crops.
    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
greater than to idle the land, economists said.
    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
impacts of such a program.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's economic crisis is forcing a
wholesale re-examination of the established strategy for
dealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.
    While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed
in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the
debt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least
some bankers that new ideas are needed.
    "The time has come to look at the alternatives," one
seasoned debt rescheduler said.
    Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating
the 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in
principle last October was prompting top bankers to examine 
the way they are managing the debt crisis.
    Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recently
of "debt fatigue" and the need to breathe new life into debt
rescheduling procedures.
    There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are
setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer
some LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,
improve financial management and get tax breaks.    
    But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role
will be gradual. "The process is such that you cannot expect
tangible progress in a short period of time," one banker said.
    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and
several European capitals in the past week when he called on
government officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a
political dialogue on debt.
    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for
instance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such
as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending
agencies.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," Mulford told
a House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any
proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks
would be a non-starter in Congress.
    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote
accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps
and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider
interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.
    Experts say the government must also make it easier for
banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.
    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks
to explore different options. "The banks should be encouraged
to look at the so-called menu approach," he said.
    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates
intact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their
exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.
    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to
receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to
new loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans
that fund the interest payments on the old debt.
    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome
negotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of "exit
bonds", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors
in exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks
would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.
    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the
commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.
    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was
challenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original
architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a
time to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.
    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. "There
does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the
bank advisory committees," a U.S. official said.
    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on
Monday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and
that U.S. banks are over-represented on them.
    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the
charge. "Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer
prepared to bail out the U.S. banks," he told reporters in New
York this week.
    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some
have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still
the right tool for the job.
    "The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity
of commercial banks alone, at least in some cases," one top New
York rescheduler said.
    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger
role, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.
    "It's the worst form of government there is apart from all
the others," one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime
minister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.

that the Congress and trade show will be divided into two parts
in 1988.
    Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business session
only and will continue to be the first week of March.
    The trade show is being changed into a new international
event called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be held
in June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said.
    Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision to
spilt the show and Congress came about because there are
producers who never get to see the trade show floor.
    "It makes sense that we divide the business session from
the trade show," Sweet said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board member Robert
Heller said the trend toward global financial markets required
that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters
as bank capital requirements.
    The recent U.S.-U.K. agreement on capital adequacy provided
a model for others, including Japan, Heller told a Georgetown
University conference on financial markets.
    "If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business in
Europe or the United States they have got to adhere to
international standards," he said.
    Heller said there were talks currently between the United
States and Japan on bank rules.
    He said the trend toward internationalization in financial
services would cause markets to move to centers with the least
regulation.
    "That is not desirable.  We want to have a sensible amount
of regulation," Heller said.

<TITLE>FORGED EXXON &lt;XON> ZERO-COUPON EURONOTES FOUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp said that forgeries of a
20-year zero-coupon Euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corp
subsidiary have been discovered in the European market.
    The issue involved was launched in 1984 and matures on
November 15, 2004. About 1,900 notes with a total face value of
19 mln dlrs and a market value of about four mln dlrs have been
identified so far, the company said.
    Exxon said that Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, the fiscal and
paying agent for the issue, Euro-clear and Cedel (the two major
European securities clearing systems), and police in London and
Brussels are investigating the case.
    Indications of forgeries came to light on Wednesday at
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co in London, which acts as Euro-clear's
depositary, and Exxon said they were confirmed today.
    Euro-clear told Exxon that it has examined to its
satisfaction all the notes at the depositary and is checking
the authenticity of new deposits of the notes as they enter the
Euro-clear System.
    Cedel is also reviewing all notes within its system, Exxon
added. At Exxon's direction, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co stands
ready to validate any notes in order to establish their
authenticity, Exxon said.
    A spokeswoman for Exxon was unable to say whether
secondary-market trading in the notes had been affected or who
would have legal responsibility for reimbursing defrauded
investors.
    Zero-coupon forgeries have turned up in the Euromarket
before. Because there are no interest coupons attached to the
bond certificates, they are easier to forge than coupon issues,
market sources said.

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS EXPORT BONUS COULD BE FUNDED FROM CCC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded from
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) if the one billion dlrs
appropriated for export bonus by Congress is exhausted.
    Lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be a
constraint on the program because USDA has the authority to use
CCC funds to continue the program. He noted Congress authorized
up to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep.
    Earlier this week, Leo Mayer, associate administrator of
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, said 865 mln dlrs of the
one billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. USDA
officials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted by
importing countries the one billion dlrs would be exhausted
soon.
    Some Congressional sources have expressed concern that the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) might try to block USDA
from seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated for
the program.
    These sources suggested the lack of funds might force USDA
to halt the program, which some commodity groups believe has
given a boost to U.S. exports of some farm products,
particularly wheat and wheat flour.
    However, Lyng's comments seemed to suggest that USDA could
at least temporarily continue the program using CCC funds and
would not be forced to curtail eep.

<TITLE>SEMICONDUCTOR FEBRUARY BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO 1.13</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CUPERTINO, Calif., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association said the February three-month average book-to-bill
ratio was 1.13 pct, compared to a revised 1.12 pct in January.
    The January figure was revised from the 1.11 pct reported
last month.
    In its monthly survey of U.S., European and Japanese
semiconductor makers, the association said average orders for
February totaled 788.2 mln dlrs, compared with 780.2 mln in
January and 684.3 mln in February a year ago.
    A book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 means that for every 100 dlrs
worth of product shipped, manufacturers received 113 dlrs worth
of new orders.
    The association said February shipments were 677.8 mln
dlrs, up 4.9 pct from the 645.9 mln shipped during January and
seven pct higher than the 633.5 mln reported in February a year
ago.
    Three month average billings for February totaled 699.4 mln
dlrs, up 0.2 pct from January's 697.8 mln, the association also
said.
    "The continuing improvement in the U.S. semiconductor
market reflects the fact that U.S. electronics equipment
manufacturers' sales are finally increasing," Semiconductor
Industry Association president Andrew Procassini said.
    The figures of the past few months suggest that the
industry is experiencing a gradual recovery that is likely to
continue, said Edward White, semiconductor analyst at E.F.
Hutton Group Inc.
    But he also said semiconductor makers still need a pickup
in capital spending within the high-technology sector before
any dramatic upturn can take place.
    The February figures show strong single-month improvement
in the semiconductor industry, but after closer examination
they may prove to be disappointing to investors, said Michael
Gumport, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    "On the face of it these numbers are below recent
expectations," Gumport also said.
    A 1.15 or higher book-to-bill ratio had been expected,
Gumport said.
    He also said the three month average book-to-bill ratio,
which was reported earlier than expected, reflected a downward
revision in the December order total, Gumport said.
    December's order rate amounted to 757.5 mln dlrs, down from
the earlier-reported 783.8 mln dlrs, the association said.

<TITLE>CHAIRMAN OF KING WORLD &lt;KWP> FACES CHARGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Miami, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roger King, chairman of King World
Productions Inc, faces charges of cocaine possession, auto
theft and strong-arm robbery stemming from his arrest in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., last month, police said.
    The report of King's legal problems sent the stock of his
company -- a syndicator of some of television's most popular
talk and game shows -- down sharply on Wall Street.
    Fort Lauderdale police spokesman Ott Cefkin said King was
arrested on February 21 on charges that he beat up a taxi
driver during a dispute over a fare and then stole the man's
car. After King was taken in custody, police found three small
bags of cocaine in his shirt pocket, Cefkin said.
    King World distributes Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and the
Oprah Winfrey Show. According to the police report, King, 42,
was in Fort Lauderdale visiting his brother when the incident
occurred.
    Police said a taxi driver picked King up outside a Fort
Lauderdale night club but stopped the car after a short
distance when he became concerned that his passenger would be
unable to pay the fare.
  "Mr. King attacked the driver, punched him and then took the
cab and drove off," Cefkin said.
  King was arrested by police a few minutes later and was
charged with strong-arm robbery, auto theft and possession of a
small quantity of cocaine, police said.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on
U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn
Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other
nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the
association.
    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and
just change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Hall
told Reuters.
    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm
policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and
supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85
cts per bushel.
    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "The
amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."
    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument
that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and
that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus
causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government
payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.
    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that
other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack
U.S. farm programs.
    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm
programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall
said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of
U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the
imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.

<DATELINE>    BIRMINGHAM, Ala, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Healthcare Services Of America
Inc said it will write off about 16 mln dlrs in non-recurring
expenses in 1986.
    It also said it expects income from operations to be about
breakeven for 1986 and the estimated loss for the year to be
about the same as the writeoffs.
    Results will be released by March 31, 1987.
    Included in the writeoffs were six mln dlrs in
developmental costs, six mln dlrs in unamortized loan costs and
debt discounts and four mln dlrs in other non-recurring costs.
    The company said it continues to be in default of certain
financial and non-financial covenants set forth in its major
loan documents.
    It said negotiations continue with the banks, but has no
assurance that such funding will continue.
    It said it authorized Smith barney, Harris Upham and Co to
seek a business combination with third parties.
    Healthcare also said the board has authorized the sale or
lease of certain assets to reduce the cash required from the
revolving credit line for completion of current construction
projects.

net income of 3.5 mln dlrs on sales of 54.4 mln dlrs

<TITLE>USAIR &lt;U> SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA &lt;TWA></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group said it sought the help
of the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight
with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order
TWA to sell its USAir shares.
    "What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal
Aviation Act," USAir said.
    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the
Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65
billion dlr takeover of USAir.
    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department
of Transportation to dismiss the application.
    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided
pre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide
a competitive and public interest analysis required under
regulations.
    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be
limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding
shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10
pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir's
stock.
    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to
more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.
    TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the
company had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in
compliance with the law.

<DATELINE>    PARK RIDGE, ILL., March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>An American Farm Bureau
Federation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian
corn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign
producers.
    AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response
to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal
that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian
growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S.
cents a bushel.
    "Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified
previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign
producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and
losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the
price of corn Worldwide," he said.

<TITLE>TAFT&lt;TFB> BIDDERS WOULD SELL ENTERTAINMENT UNIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting
Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell
the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the
investors.
    Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital
Corp &lt;NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan,
declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the
Entertainment Group. "We are considering selling the group,"
Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood
film studios which might be interested.
    Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per
share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12
pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.
    Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but
continues as vice chairman of the company.
    Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by
March 12.
    If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company
financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.
Narragansett is an investment management company specializing
in leveraged buyout transactions.
    Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to
say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.
    Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and
American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return
telephohe calls seeking comment.
    But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said "I
don't think it's worth 150 dlrs." He noted Taft recently agreed
to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.
He said the entertainment group, which includes the
Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a
glut of animated product.
    Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its
major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the
company.
    MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the
company with a distribution of various pieces to the major
shareholders among the possibilities.
    Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin
Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the
belief the company would be worth more with a change in its
strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent
television stations because the company paid too much.

<TITLE>POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Higher oil prices and stronger than
expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
chart outlook, financial analysts said.
    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
during February was above market expectations for a rise of
170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
futures that drove the June contract through key technical
support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
    "I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"
said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
losses.
    "I tend to go along with the double top scenario," said
Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
an improving inflation outlook.
    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflation
outlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead to
relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
prices.
    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
    "The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"
said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
"media induced," Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
production may be within quotas, "oil stocks are at
tremendously high levels."
    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES SOME S. AFRICAN IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury proposed allowing 
temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
fall.
    The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next
week requests written congressional and public comment within
60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported
for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.
    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
    "The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal
government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in
a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on
uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for
processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the
act," the Treasury brief said.
    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
the Soviet Union for processing.
    Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African
ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export
"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a
license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission."
    The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods
to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
organizations for repair or servicing in the United States.
    "The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made
under bond," the brief said.
    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United
States to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation
practiced by South Africa's white minority government,
prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,
coal and textiles at the end of 1986.

German subsidiary has received a contract valued at about eight
mln dlrs from the Soviet Union to supply engineering and
manufacturing services to build a television parts plant.
    The company's Precision Etched Products unit in Muellheim,
West Germany, signed the contract to provide services that will
enable the Soviets to build a plant to make television tube
aperture masks, it said.
    A BMC spokesman told Reuters the one-year contract will be
for about eight mln dlrs. The contract is the first BMC has had
with the Soviet Union in 10 years ago, he said.
    The project has received the necessary U.S. government

    BMC also said it has entered into a joint venture agreement
with Italy to produce finished single vision plastic eyewear
lenses using a new manufacturing process. It would provide no
further details.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>A government official said that a
decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a
record harvest would not affect Argentina's exports.
    "We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided
not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one
of our main customers," Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries
Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said.
    Private sources also said Argentina's exports would not be
affected by Brazil's decision, which Agriculture Minister Iris
Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo.
    Brazil had not asked for any Argentine maize, they said.
    They also said a smaller crop and adverse weather this
summer in Argentina had reduced production.
    Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes
of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any
from Argentina.
    The Soviet Union was Argentina's main customer and Japan
was also becoming a bigger importer of the country's maize, he
said.

<TITLE>DOT DISMISSES TWA &lt;TWA>, USAIR &lt;U> APPLICATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
control of USAir Group.
    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
could put together an application for control that met the
agency's procedural requirements.
    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
    But the DOT said it would not wait.
    "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order
issued late Friday.
    "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.
    "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
procedural rules," the DOT said.
    The agency added that it would continue to consider a
separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
stock through a voting trust.
    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
did not meet DOT requirements.

    "When the DOT opens for business on Monday morning, we will
be refiling a perfected and completed section 408 application,"
said TWA general counsel Mark Buckstein.
    Buckstein said the DOT ruled the application, which was
filed Wednesday, was incomplete. He said he did not yet know
why the agency objected.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA BAILS OUT ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's central bank said it
acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing &lt;United Asian Bank Bhd>
(UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
rebuild public confidence in it.
    UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
    But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
Indian Government.
    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
228.74 mln ringgit.
    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
    The central bank early this week also announced that it had
bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
&lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its
capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
    Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the
shares of the two banks.
    "The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the
stability of the these banks," it added.
    The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the
Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an
ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
a strong earthquake.
    Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
    Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a
television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a
month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin
oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
    The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point
Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near
the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
    Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
    The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.
    Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and
holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines
Ministry communique said.

<TITLE>FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard
a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could
rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.
    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no
hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian
coast last night.
    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was
the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.
    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914
when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland
collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.
    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that
took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was
torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.
    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries
sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and
147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.

were missing, bringing the total of dead or presumed dead to

<TITLE>GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior officials in the West German
coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
international monetary conference in Paris.
    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
increase in income tax.
    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
medium-sized companies.
    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
    The West German government had come under pressure from the
United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
growth was uncertain.
    The government said in January it was aiming for real
growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.
Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
days ago, remains open at the moment."

<TITLE>EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>As a British government investigation got
under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free
Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had
already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.
    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary
investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry
capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to
leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.
    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks
through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend
Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.
    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the
Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned
to pull them out of service at present.
    "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait
and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC
radio.
    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged
hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts
had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo"
ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.
    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime
Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on
roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck
areas divided by bulkheads.
    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German
yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety
standards.
    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would
have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its
design.
    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley
said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to
a barge.
    "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out
of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is
compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said.
    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly
stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.
    "If you do get water into that area then you can get very
severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE AFTER COURT DECISION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hundreds of marines were on alert
at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain
on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court
yesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners
have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.
    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the
workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our
protest until the end," a union leader said.
    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines
take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and
let the marines handle the situation by themselves.
    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to
send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister
Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national
security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has
cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.
    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their
shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two
stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's Armed Forces Commander
General Benny Murdani said warnings about an extremist threat
to the country's forthcoming elections do not mean the security
situation has deteriorated.
   He was quoted in today's edition of the armed forces
newspaper Harian AB as saying the warnings were only an appeal
for vigilance ahead of the April 23 polls.
    Major-General Setijana, military commander of central Java,
said in widely-quoted remarks last week that both leftist and
rightist extremists were planning to sabotage the polls in an
attempt to topple President Suharto's government.
    Murdani told a meeting of the ruling Golkar party in
Jakarta yesterday that he believed the security situation was
now stable.
    However, he also said mass meetings during the election
campaign period should be avoided, as they could trigger what
he termed a critical situation very easily.
    About 60 people died in accidents and election-related
violence during the last parliamentary elections in 1982.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By WALKER SIMON, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<TITLE>EC FARM LIBERALISATION SEEN HURTING THAI TAPIOCA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Any European Community decision to
liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca
industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the
Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).
    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to
cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more
competitive than tapioca in the European market.
    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more
than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by
Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25
mln tonnes a year until 1990.
    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff
loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct
import duty.
    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,
suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.
    He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are
close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear
completely."
    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it
had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling
on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China has raised the prices it pays
farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse
a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture,
Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.
    The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt
intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve
crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He
gave no details of the price increases.
    On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases
from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of
purchasing through agents.
    He said the state will increase investment in agriculture
and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production
materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.
    The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and
payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a
low state-fixed price.
    He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln
tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year
and an actual 391 mln last year.
    He gave no more details.

<TITLE>GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Increased federal government borrowing
needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five
dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an
increase in export volume, industry sources said.
    The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky
coal and at 43.80 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal, fob.
    Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both
areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said.
    The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to
3.7 mln tonnes in 1987/88, but the Soviet Union urged Japan to
increase the amount to 6.5 mln, they said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The special prosecutor in the Iran arms
scandal is expected to bring indictments that could include
felony charges against senior Reagan administration officials,
the New York Times reported.
    It quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of the
investigation as saying special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who
is investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.
    The paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud the
government, obstructing justice and making false statements to
the government. It said the prosecutor had not ruled out any
suspects, including current and former government officials.
    But the paper said Walsh, in his investigation of the sale
of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to the U.S.-backed
contra rebels in Nicaragua, was running short of time. This was
because Congress has begun granting immunity to key figures in
the affair to speed up congressional investigations.
    The paper quoted one official as saying that, while
obstruction of justice was usually hard to prove, evidence of a
cover-up "may have been comically obvious here."

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT OUTLOOK SEEN AS UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for Australian industrial
investment is uncertain, with capital spending at an historical
low and business overly dependent on domestic demand, the
Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Institute
of Economic and Industry Research said.
    The organizations were commenting in their monthly Economic
Focus on a survey commissioned by the Australian Council of
Trade Unions concluded.
    Private investment as a proportion of gross domestic
product fell to 9.8 pct in 1985/86 from 15 pct in 1981 and is
forecast to decline to 8.8 pct in 1987/88, the Focus said.
    Earlier studies indicated private investment could sustain
a two pct long-term economic growth rate, but the latest
figures suggested this could not be maintained, it said.
    The Australian dollar's depreciation, coupled with research
incentives, is increasing the profitability of investment for
exports but several factors inhibit growth. These include weak
commodity prices, high fixed capital costs, uncertain domestic
economic policy and corporate debt.
    Firms have tended to finance expansion with debt rather
than equity, leading to a 39 pct rise in the ratio of interest
payments to gross cash flow between 1980/85, the survey found.
    Economic Focus said many companies looked for a 2.5 to 4.5
year payback on capital investment or export development --
often too short a period to secure markets.
    The relatively low incentive to produce for export in part
reflected the ownership of Australian industry, they said.
    Sixty-seven pct of Australian-owned companies said external
demand was conducive to investment against only 27 pct for
foreign-owned companies.
    The survey covered 45 companies accounting for about 25 pct
of total investment, Economic Focus said.

<TITLE>JAPAN RATING AGENCIES IN BATTLE WITH U.S. GIANTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three Japanese credit rating agencies are
entering into fierce competition with &lt;Moody's Japan K.K.> and
&lt;Standard and Poor's Asia Inc>, the local branches of the two
U.S. Giants, as the Japanese credit market opens up to
foreigners, Japanese rating agency managers said.
    Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of &lt;Chiyoda Fire
and Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the
Japanese agencies, which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bond
only A-plus, to come under some criticism for being too
conservative, they said.
    Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer.
    Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for more
than a century while &lt;Moody's Investors Service Inc> was
founded more than 80 years ago. Each has rated some 20,000 to
30,000 U.S. And about 100 Japanese issues.
    With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through
overseas financing companies, Chiyoda's rating will stimulate
their interest in using the U.S. Agencies, the analysts said.
    Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its
strong capitalisation, stable performance and high levels of
unrealised appreciation, particularly in its stock portfolio.
    The U.S. Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory
environment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate.
    Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings
on the claims-paying ability of &lt;Sumitomo Life Insurance Co>
and &lt;Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's,
the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers.
    Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off
shocks from any foreign investment, Standard and Poor's said.
    A month ago &lt;Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned
an AAA rating to &lt;Financial Securities Assurance Inc>, a U.S.
Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities.
     "NIS has assigned rates on a U.S. Firm for the first time in
Japan, which was the first step into the U.S. Rating market,"
Kazuya Kumura, general manager of NIS, said.
    Kyosuke Yoshida, managing director of Japan Bond Research
Institute (JBRI), said, "Agencies should be more actively used
to respond better to growing overseas investor interest."
    Takeshi Watanabe, president of Japan Credit Rating Agency
Ltd (JCRA), said, "(Our) advantages are that we have a deeper
understanding of business practices in Japan, other Asian
nations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert
and quick to react to domestic news."
     JBRI, with 12 years' experience, is Japan's largest agency.
The other two have been in business for two years.
    Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by
Japanese residents, which is expected soon, will stimulate
local agencies to grow quickly, securities analysts said.
    The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by
gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation.
    In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an
A-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai, shogun and
euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent
financial criteria.
     But local companies, regardless of the rating obtained for
a planned bond, must meet the tough financial criteria set by
commissioned banks and underwriters, which includes minimum net
asset requirements and capitalisation, local agency managers
said.
    Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting
bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments.
    Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by
the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese
credit rating agencies, the managers said.
     "The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into
prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial
criteria," JCRA's Watanabe said.
    The Finance Ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds.
    "An internationally comprehensive market system is needed to
lure more overseas investors into the Japanese market," JBRI's
Yoshida said.

developing countries, Bangladesh Commerce Minister M.A. Munim
told officials from 30 Asian countries in the Group of 77.
    The officials are meeting to finalise the agenda for the
group's regional ministerial conference here Saturday.
Delegates from all 43 Asian member countries of the G-77 are
expected to attend the later meeting.
    Commerce Ministry officials said the countries will try to
adopt a common strategy to counter protectionist measures by
developed countries and forge developing country cooperation
    Commerce Secretary A.B.M. Ghulam Mostafa said the officials
would discuss issues relating to financial resources,
commodities, international trade and least developed countries,
and formulate "concrete measures towards concerted action."
    Recommendations of the Dhaka meeting will be placed before
the July United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
meeting at Geneva, officials said.
    The Dhaka meeting would also discuss the possibility of
setting up a "South Bank," along the lines of the Asian
Development Bank, to boost financial exchanges and economic
coperation between developing countries. It has not been
proposed formally and no details were given.

<TITLE>FOREIGN BROKERS MAY GET MORE ACCESS TO JAPAN BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses are thinking of
allowing foreign brokerages to underwrite more Japanese
government bonds from April, securities managers said.
    The average foreign brokerage now underwrites only around
0.07 pct of each such issue's volume, they told Reuters.
    The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan to
liberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading.
    Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of U.S.
Treasury issues. &lt;Nomura Securities International Inc> and
&lt;Daiwa Securities America Inc> were named primary dealers in
U.S. Government securities in December, they noted.
    Brokerages within the government bond-writing syndicate are
now negotiating by how much foreign house subscriptions to
government bonds should be raised, the managers said.
    The syndicate members agreed in April, 1982 that 26 pct of
10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93
securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks.
    The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement.
    Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bonds
due to their end-investor appeal. &lt;Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd>
caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100
billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3.
    Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate its
commitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding its
underwriting share of 10-year bonds, securities sources said.
    They said that to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share, cut local brokerages' share, or introduce auctions to
the government bond primary market, the sources said.
    Bankers are likely to oppose losing any share and the
Finance Ministry is unwilling to introduce auctions on the
ground that it would slow smooth absorption of bonds in the
secondary market, securities manager said.

<TITLE>U.S. SEEKS MAJOR JAPANESE ECONOMIC CHANGE IN APRIL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States has openly attacked
Japan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and
warned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be
significant, senior U.S. Officials said.
    In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan's
overall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its
fiscal position is not as dire as it says.
    The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.
Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating
attempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.
    The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by the
conservative Reagan administration, which until recently has
been sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government
role in the economy, diplomats said.
    Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take
action to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said
the April package must be more than routine.
    Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do
not expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of
last April's measures.
    That means accelerated public investment, lower interest
rates on government housing loans and measures to pass along
the benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of which
would have a major immediate economic impact.
    Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to
stimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the
Finance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.
Policy.
    But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by
fanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domestic
affairs.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan
would stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism,
but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.
    The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousness
within the Reagan administration.
    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen
Wallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarily
want an increase in Japan's budget deficit.
    "There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its
economy," he said.
    The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
    What is new is U.S. Backing for the position.
    At last week's talks, Japanese officials said, they argued
Tokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost
the economy with funds from the giant postal savings system.
    But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for,
and receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, a
senior U.S. Official said.
    Other western officials are not so sure. They said it would
take time to boost public investment much further, as there are
not that many projects in the pipeline.
    Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic
construction companies, but it would not have much impact on
imports, they added.

pct growth over the year ending in November.
    MAS said in its latest monthly statistical bulletin the
December increase was largely due to seasonal year-end demand.
    The demand deposit component of M-1 increased to 4.79
billion dlrs in December from 4.62 billion in November and 4.05
billion in December 1985.
    Currency in active circulation rose to 5.03 billion dlrs in
December from 4.85 billion in November and 4.74 billion a year
earlier.
    Broadly-based M-2 money supply rose 1.6 pct to 30.95
billion dlrs during December after a 1.7 pct rise in November,
bringing year-on-year growth to 10.0 pct for the year ending in
December against 10.2 pct for the year ending in November.

<TITLE>CHINESE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE UP AFTER WEAK 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of China's industrial output in
January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the
same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.
    Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January
1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.
    The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to
last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was
made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes
were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the
last quarter of 1986.
    The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose
and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.
    It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987
industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with
better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway
throughout the country. It gave no more details.
    The official industrial growth target this year is seven
pct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.

<TITLE>IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese customers have bought nearly six
mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
customers with different formulas. One company has bought
800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.

    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
markets, oil traders said.
    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
are supporting spot price levels, they said.

    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one
Japanese trader said.
    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the
official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the
price related to processing arrangements.
