# NaiveBayes_LearningCurves
<h3>Naive Bayes comparison and learning curves.</h3>

This code uses existing implementations of Naive Bayes (taken from Scikit Learn) to study the trend of generalization error  with increasing number of examples. <br>
Concretely two textual datasets are used:
<ul>
<li>20 newsgroups</li>
<li>Reuters-21578</li>
</ul>
Learning curves of Naive Bayes are compared and plotted (using Matplotlib).<br>
In particular the implementations of Naive Bayes analized are: Bernoulli and Multinomial
<ul>
<li>Bernoulli Naive Bayes</li>
<li>Multinomial Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>
