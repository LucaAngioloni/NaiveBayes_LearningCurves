# NaiveBayes_LearningCurves
Naive Bayes comparison and learning curves.

This code uses existing implementations of Naive Bayes (Taken from Scikit Learn) to study the trend of generalization error  with increasing number of examples. <br>
Concretely two textual datasets are used:
<ul>
<li>20 newsgroups</li>
<li>Reuters-21578</li>
</ul>
Learning curves of Naive Bayes are compared and plotted (using Matplotlib).<br>
In particular the implementations of Naive Bayes used are: Bernoulli and Multinomial
<ul>
<li>Bernoulli Naive Bayes</li>
<li>Multinomial Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>
