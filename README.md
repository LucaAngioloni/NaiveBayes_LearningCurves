# NaiveBayes_LearningCurves
Naive Bayes comparison and learning curves.

This code uses existing implementations of Naive Bayes (Taken from Scikit Learn) to study the trend of generalization error  with increasing number of examples. Concretely two textual datasets are used: 20 newsgroups & Reuters-21578. 
Learning curves of Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes are compared and plotted (using Matplotlib).
